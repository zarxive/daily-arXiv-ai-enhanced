We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.\n  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u573a\uff08fMLIP\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u65f6\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f4e\u4f30\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u6216\u4ea7\u751f\u865a\u5047\u6392\u65a5\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6392\u9664+U\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u573a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u5bf9+U\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u52bf\u573a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6750\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684+U\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1\u52bf\u573a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6c27\u5438\u9644\u80fd\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52bf\u573a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u6392\u9664+U\u56e0\u5b50\u3002"}}

Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage.

It is typically acquired on-site from generators containing $^{99}$Mo, in turn produced at nuclear reactor facilities. This supply chain involves multiple points of vulnerability, which can lead to shortages and delays with potentially negative patient outcomes. We report on the development of a new family of cyclotrons originally designed for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment, capable of operating at much higher current than typical cyclotrons. When operated with deuterons at 1.5 MeV/amu and an anticipated continuous beam current of 5 mA, simulations project that such a system would yield $\\sim$10$^{13}$ neutrons per second using a thin beryllium target. This neutron yield is sufficient, in principle, to support $^{99}$Mo production without the use of highly enriched uranium or reliance on foreign reactors. Simulations and conceptual design studies suggest that the system's beam dynamics could make it a viable pathway toward decentralized, hospital-based isotope generation.

Although AKT is a multidomain serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, how these domains cooperate to regulate AKT activation on membranes remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, we identify four distinct membrane-binding modes that differ in the orientations and membrane contacts of the PH and kinase domains. In addition to PIP$_3$ binding to the PH domain, we observe specific PIP$_3$ interactions with basic residues in the kinase domain. In the most stable mode, PIP$_3$ interacts with both the canonical and a secondary binding site in the PH domain, while the kinase domain adopts an orientation in which the activation-loop phosphorylation site is exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the populations of these binding modes depend on the PIP$_3$ concentration in the membrane, leading to changes in the preferred orientation of AKT. These findings shed light on how lipid recognition by the PH domain and the kinase domain of AKT cooperatively shape its membrane-bound conformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores how the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates AKT activation on cellular membranes by studying the interactions between the AKT kinase domains and PIP$_3$ in lipid bilayers.", "motivation": "Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind AKT activation is crucial for gaining insights into cellular signaling pathways and their role in various cellular processes.", "method": "The research employs molecular dynamics simulations to analyze full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, identifying four distinct membrane-binding modes through computational modeling.", "result": "The study reveals that PIP$_3$ interacts with both the PH and kinase domains of AKT, influencing its membrane-bound conformations.

EODs based on potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) crystals feature some of the highest number of resolvable spots. These deflectors rely on internal electric fields generated by trapped electrons to enable beam scanning. However, visible light induces rapid photoionization of trapped charges, thus KTN-based deflectors are typically continuously recharged with a bias voltage that effectively limits the range of the deflector. Recent work has proposed the use of KTN-based EODs for biological imaging with infrared excitation light, but quantitative data on near-infrared photoionization is lacking. Here, we present quantitative measurements of photoionization in KTN deflectors across the NIR-I and NIR-IIa biological imaging windows (700 - 1300 nm), a range that is particularly important for deep tissue imaging and nonlinear microscopy. Using a two-beam polarization interferometer, we measured trapped charge density as a function of photon fluence. We observed that the photoionization rate decreases dramatically with increasing wavelength. The charge density decay curves exhibit multi-exponential behavior that cannot be explained by a single-trap model without recapture, indicating the presence of multiple trap species or substantial recapture.

Using the Eckart frame to decouple local vibrations (phonons) from rigid-body rotation, we demonstrate that spin angular momentum is simultaneously transferred into both phonons and rigid-body rotation in an asymmetric way: rigid-body rotation acquires the dominant share of angular momentum, while phonons absorb most of the resulting kinetic energy. This divergent transfer of angular momentum and energy identifies phonons as direct and indispensable participants in the Einstein-de Haas dynamics. Furthermore, we find that pseudo-dipolar anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction exert distinct control over the angular momentum transfer. Stronger pseudo-dipolar anisotropy increases the total amount of transferred angular momentum, whereas stronger Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction accelerates the transfer rate and increases the proportion of phonon angular momentum.

At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5fae\u6ce2\u529f\u7387\u5bf9\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50-\u5149\u5076\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u6ce2\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u78c1\u9759\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8017\u6563\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5076\u5408\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u5fae\u6ce2\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5076\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u968f\u7740\u529f\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5076\u5408\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5f31\u76f4\u81f3\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86Suhl\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6d88\u4ea1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u6ce2\u529f\u7387\u5bf9\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50-\u5149\u5076\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u4e0e\u5149\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u78c1\u6027\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5982\u9891\u7387\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u5f00\u5173\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86yttrium iron garnet-sphere/split-ring-resonator\u6742\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50-\u5149\u5076\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u6ce2\u529f\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u89c2\u5bdf\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u968f\u529f\u7387\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u5fae\u6ce2\u529f\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50-\u5149\u5076\u5408\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u6ce2\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50-\u5149\u5076\u5408\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u78c1\u6027\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

A solution is offered by the blue-detuned MOT where sub-Doppler cooling dominates and the cloud is compressed. Several blue-detuned molecular MOTs have been implemented. A recent implementation relies on a pair of orthogonally polarized components whose frequency separation is smaller than the transition linewidth. We identify the trapping force in these MOTs. At a certain magnetic field, there is a state that is dark to the laser propagating in one direction, but not to the counter-propagating one. This Zeeman-induced dark state (ZIDS) sets up an imbalance in the photon scattering rate, leading to a restoring force. We also study the role of the moving lattices generated by the closely-spaced frequency components of the light. We show that there is a velocity-dependent force that drives the molecules towards the speeds of these moving lattices, and that over a relevant range of magnetic fields this combines with the ZIDS force to transport molecules towards the centre of the MOT. Here, gray molasses cooling, assisted by non-adiabatic transitions driven by the time-varying polarization of the light field, cools the molecules towards zero velocity. We study these mechanisms for model systems with simple level structures, then extend them to molecules with ground state hyperfine structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench.

Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation.

Quantum resource theory provides a rigorous operational framework to define and characterize such quantifiers of symmetry-breaking. As a starter, we exemplify the usefulness of resource theory by noting that second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement asymmetry can increase under symmetric operations, and hence is not a resource monotone, and should not solely be used to capture Quantum Mpemba effect. More importantly, motivated by mixed-state physics where weak and strong symmetries are inequivalent, we formulate a new resource theory tailored to strong symmetry, identifying free states and strong-covariant operations. This framework systematically identifies quantifiers of strong symmetry breaking for a broad class of symmetry groups, including a strong entanglement asymmetry. A particularly transparent structure emerges for U(1) symmetry, where the resource theory for the strong symmetry breaking has a completely parallel structure to the entanglement theory: the variance of the conserved quantity fully characterizes the asymptotic manipulation of strong symmetry breaking. By connecting this result to the knowledge of the geometry of quantum state space, we obtain a quantitative framework to track how weak symmetry breaking is irreversibly converted into strong symmetry breaking in open quantum systems.

Interestingly, at low energies, these symmetries may not flow to the topological higher-form symmetries familiar from relativistic quantum field theories, but instead to non-topological higher-form symmetries. We present concrete lattice models exhibiting this phenomenon. One particular model is an $\\mathbb{R}$ generalization of the Kitaev honeycomb model featuring an $\\mathbb{R}$ lattice 1-form symmetry. We show that its low-energy effective field theory is a gapless, non-relativistic theory with a non-topological $\\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry. In both the lattice model and the effective field theory, we demonstrate that the non-topological $\\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry is not robust against local perturbations. In contrast, we also study various modifications of the toric code and their low-energy effective field theories to demonstrate that the compact $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice 1-form symmetry does become topological at low energies unless the Hamiltonian is fine-tuned. Along the way, we clarify the rules for constructing low-energy effective field theories in the presence of multiple superselection sectors. Finally, we argue on general grounds that non-compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}$ 1-form symmetries) in lattice systems generically remain non-topological at low energies, whereas compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $U(1)$ 1-form symmetries) generically become topological.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Gonzalez"], "title": "Integrating prior knowledge in equation discovery: Interpretable symmetry-informed neural networks and symbolic regression via characteristic curves", "comment": null, "summary": "Data-driven equation discovery aims to reconstruct governing equations directly from empirical observations. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, where multiple distinct mathematical models may yield similar errors, thus complicating model selection and failing to guarantee a unique representation of the underlying mechanisms. This issue can be addressed by incorporating inductive biases to constrain the search space and discard the undesirable models. The characteristic curves-based (CCs) framework offers a modular approach ideally suited to this aim. This approach is based on the specification of structural families that possess provable identifiability properties. Crucially, this framework enables practitioners to embed domain expertise directly into the learning process and facilitates the integration of diverse post-processing tools. In this work, we build upon the recent neural network implementation of this formalism (NN-CC), which benefits from the universal approximation capabilities of NNs. Specifically, we extend NN-CC by introducing two inductive biases: (i) symmetry constraints and (ii) post-processing with symbolic regression. Using a chaotic Duffing oscillator and a discontinuous stick-slip model under varying Gaussian noise levels, we show how these extensions systematically improve the discovery process. We also analyze the integration of sparse and symbolic regression (using SINDy and PySR) into the CC-based formalism. These extensions (SINDy-CC and SR-CC) consistently show improvements as prior information is incorporated. By enabling the integration of prior or hypothesized knowledge into the learning and post-processing stages, the CC-based formalism emerges as a promising candidate to address identifiability issues in purely data-driven methods, advancing the goal of interpretable and reliable system identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Next, we present a novel method based on the Green function method, which leads to a semi-infinite determinant from which we are able to obtain the numerical values of the eigenvalues by direct calculation.\n  Using suitable numerical methods for the direct calculation of the continued fraction and the semi-infinite determinant, we show that both methods are consistent within 25 digits of accuracy. We show that the correct energy levels for the Dirac equation follow from our results by a suitable mapping of the variables.\n  The results are in total agreement with earlier calculations found in the literature and extend this by several digits of additional accuracy.

Recent demonstrations of low-loss BaTiO$_3$ waveguides and high-Q resonators have established BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator as a promising platform for next-generation frequency-conversion and quantum photonic technologies. However, while BaTiO$_3$ electro-optic modulators are now well developed, nonlinear BaTiO$_3$ waveguide engineering remains comparatively immature. Techniques widely used in lithium niobate, such as periodic poling for quasi-phase-matching, are poorly suited to BaTiO$_3$ because epitaxial thin films exhibit high coercive fields, strong strain-clamping effects, multivariant domain structures, and slow, complex switching dynamics. These factors make accurate periodic poling challenging and hinder the development of efficient $X^{(2)}$ frequency converters. Here, we introduce a fabrication-robust alternative based on linear-nonlinear hybrid waveguides, where TiO$_2$ is selectively incorporated into BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides to enhance nonlinear mode overlap while relying solely on modal phase-matching. Using coupled-mode-theory simulations, we identify phase-matched geometries and show that the hybrid design achieves a 2.75x increase in normalized second harmonic generation efficiency over monolithic BaTiO$_3$ waveguides. The uniform, lithographically defined cross-section makes the approach highly scalable.

Here, we show that in non-uniform ferrimagnets such gradients not only exert a net force on the wall, but also modify its effective mass, enabling an entirely new acceleration mechanism. As a wall traverses regions of varying exchange or anisotropy, it can shed or gain mass leading to a \"rocket effect\" as in variable-mass systems.

This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u76f4\u6d41\u548c\u5fae\u6ce2\u7535\u573a\u6291\u5236\u5f3a\u6781\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u6fc0\u53d1\u8d85\u51b7\u5206\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u4e24\u4e2a\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5206\u5b50\u65cb\u8f6c\u6001\u7684\u76f4\u6d41\u573a\u4f7f\u5b83\u4eec\u53d1\u751fForster\u5171\u632f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u6ce2\u573a\u4f7f\u5206\u5b50\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664\u6240\u6709\u957f\u671f\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u7684\u4e24\u4f53\u548c\u4e09\u4f53\u78b0\u649e\u635f\u5931\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u6291\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u5076\u6781\u548c\u53cd\u5076\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6539\u53d8\u5149\u7684\u78b0\u649e\uff08\u8fd9\u662f\u4e24\u539f\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u635f\u5931\u6765\u6e90\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\uff08BEC\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u94a0\u94ef\uff08NaCs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728100\u7eb3\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u5230\u635f\u5931\u7387\u6bd4\u503c\u7ea6\u4e3a10^6\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u91cf\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u6355\u83b7\u8d85\u51b7\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u78b0\u649e\u635f\u5931\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728 condensed-matter \u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u5de7\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u76f4\u6d41\u548c\u5fae\u6ce2\u7535\u573a\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u5206\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f4\u6d41\u7535\u573a\u5c06\u4e24\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u65cb\u8f6c\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u4e3aForster\u5171\u632f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u6ce2\u7535\u573a\u4f7f\u5206\u5b50\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u80fd\u7ea7\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u957f\u671f\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u78b0\u649e\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728100\u7eb3\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f39\u6027\u5230\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea610^6\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 crushing loss \u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7981\u9522\u6001\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u78b0\u649e\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u51b7\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

They are phenomenologically interesting as models of dynamical dark energy that, unlike scalar-tensor theories, can naturally accommodate cosmological anisotropies. A key open question is whether such theories can be fundamental. As a first step in this direction, we investigate whether they admit an ultraviolet completion within a quantum field theory framework, working with a truncation comprising up to four powers of the Proca field and up to two derivatives. We find a triplet of non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed points, that lie very close to one another. Only one of them features a non-tachyonic Proca mass and could thus serve as a consistent ultraviolet completion for Generalized Proca Theories. We name it the Proca fixed point. We discuss its stability and contrast its features with those of the standard Reuter fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity and matter. In particular, we show that the Gaussian and Reuter fixed points lie on singular hypersurfaces of the flow of Generalized Proca Theories, yet can act as quasi-fixed points in certain regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Generalized Proca Theories can be consistently completed to a quantum field theory via the Proca fixed point.", "motivation": "The paper explores the potential of Generalized Proca Theories as a quantum field theory framework, contributing to understanding their role as models for dark energy.", "method": "Applied truncation techniques with four Proca field powers and two derivatives, analyzing ultraviolet fixed points.", "result": "The Proca fixed point stands out as a viable ultraviolet completion, despite proximity to other fixed points which are problematic.", "conclusion": "Proca fixed point provides a consistent quantum framework for Generalized Proca Theories, advancing their use in fundamental physics."}}

In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $\u03bb(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \\to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent. Our results identify the Lyapunov exponent as a unified dynamical probe capable of capturing both first-order phase coexistence and second-order critical behavior in black-hole thermodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e864\u7ef4\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279AdS\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e42\u5f8b\u7535\u78c1\u573a\uff08p=3/4\uff09\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8ationally\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0ethermodynamic\u76f8\u53d8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728canonical\u7cfb\u7efc\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ecb\u7535\u8377\u4e34\u754c\u503cQ_c\uff0c\u5c06\u76f8\u53d8\u5206\u6210\u5c0f/\u5927\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08SBH/LBH\uff09\u4e00\u7ea7Transitionsex\u533a\u548c\u5355\u76f8\u533a\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u53ea\u5141\u8bb8\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u76f8\u3002\u5728SBH/LBH\u5171\u5b58\u533a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684Lyapunov\u6307\u6570\u03bb(T)\u5728Transitions\u70b9\u6709\u6709\u9650Discontinuity\u3002\u968f\u7740Q\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8eQ_c\uff0c\u4e00\u7ea7Transitions\u5728\u4e8c\u7ea7\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u6d88\u5931\u3002near\u4e34\u754c\uff0cLyapunov\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\u9075\u5faa\u5747\u503c\u573a\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u65701/2\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6cd5\u5219\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4e34\u754c\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570b_c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u591a\u503c\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u65f6\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9661\u5ced\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLyapunov\u6307\u6570\u662f\u6355\u6349\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e00\u7ea7\u76f8\u5b58\u548c\u4e8c\u7ea7\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279AdS\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u52a8ationally\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u52a8ationally\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u53d8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u76844\u7ef4AdS\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u52a8ationally\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u56fe\u3001Lyapunov\u6307\u6570\u3001\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u52a8ationally\u7279\u6027\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u7ea7\u548c\u4e8c\u7ea7\u76f8\u53d8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5951\u5408\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLyapunov\u6307\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u52a8ationally\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57284\u7ef4AdS\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8ationally\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u53d8\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Lyapunov\u6307\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

It was observed experimentally that the 3-hydroxychromone (3-HC) system exhibits two distinct proton-transfer time scales upon excitation to the lowest \"bright\" singlet excited state: an ultrafast component on the femtosecond time scale and a slower one on the picosecond time scale, largely insensitive to solvent effects. Up to now, the microscopic origin of the second time constant has only been hypothesised. Here, using mixed quantum-classical non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, we explicitly observe the two ESIPT time constants and we rationalise the origin of the second time scale by the presence of a competitive out-of-plane hydrogen torsional motion. Comprehensive analysis of the excited-state potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic trajectories enables us to construct an explicit reaction network for 3-HC, delineating the interplay between canonical ESIPT and torsion-mediated pathways. This unified mechanistic framework reconciles the coexistence of ultrafast and slower ESIPT components, offering new insights into the non-adiabatic excited-state dynamics of the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u975e\u7edd\u5730\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e863-\u7f9f\u57fa\u535f\u5549\uff083-HC\uff09\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6fc0 excited\u6001\u5185\u8d28\u5b50\u8f6c\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u548c\u6162\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52bf\u80fd\u9762\u5206\u6790\u548c\u975e\u7edd\u5730\u8f68\u8ff9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u5feb\u548c\u6162\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a3-HC\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6001\u5185\u8d28\u5b50\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u548c\u6162\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6839\u672c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u975e\u7edd\u5730\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u52bf\u80fd\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c3-HC\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6fc0\u6001\u5185\u8d28\u5b50\u8f6c\u79fb\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6162\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7531\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6c22\u952e\u626d\u66f2\u8fd0\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u7edd\u5730\u6fc0\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8d85\u5feb\u548c\u6162\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u3002"}}

Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Lett. 36, 3530 (2011)]. We show that the microscopic dipole phase at the extended harmonic frequencies is sensitive to the relative IR-XUV delay and IR intensity, whereas the corresponding signal intensity drops significantly for chirped XUV pulses with poor temporal coherence.

A common expectation is that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry, destabilizes these phases by gapping their low-energy modes. Revisiting this assumption, we map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet using spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. We find that while infinitesimally weak SOC indeed drives a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity. The resulting finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses, including a giant magnetocaloric effect, highlighting their potential relevance to real materials. At larger SOC, the system transitions into distinct magnetic orders, including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on a geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnet, revealing a mechanism where thermal fluctuations can stabilize supersolidity against SOC.", "motivation": "The paper explores the role of spin-orbit coupling in stabilizing quantum phases like spin supersolids, challenging the conventional understanding that SOC destabilizes such phases by gapping their low-energy modes.", "method": "The research uses spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations to map out the effects of SOC on the phase diagram of the frustrated triangular-lattice magnet.", "result": "The key findings include that while infinitesimally weak SOC can drive a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid, thermal fluctuations can counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity at non-zero temperatures.

The runtime of our method scales approximately linearly with the number of sites, and remains well below 100 ms for an array of 100 x 100 sites on a desktop computer. It is therefore fully compatible with a real-time usage.

This coupling hybridizes the system modes into upper and lower polariton branches. The strength of the interaction depends on the number of emitters and on their orientation and spatial arrangement relative to the metallic surface. These structural factors have profound consequences for the ensuing photoexcited dynamics. Despite the extensive spectroscopic work on plexcitonic systems, direct understanding of the molecular geometry at the metal interface remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive structural characterization of one of the most widely studied plexcitons formed by the cyanine dye 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and silver nanoprisms using a combination of NMR, THz-Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. By comparing the signals from the monomeric and aggregated forms of TDBC with that of the plexciton, we identify shared spectral fingerprints that reveal how molecular packing is modified when the aggregate adsorbs on the silver surface. We observe Raman modes specific to plexciton systems, and identify NOESY cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, that along with THz-Raman modes in the 10-400 cm$^{-1}$ region are sensitive indicators of aggregation geometry and adsorption. We find that isolated TDBC monomers adopt an asymmetric conformation in which both sulfobutyl chains lie on the same side of the chromophore, while J-aggregates adopt a symmetric up-down alternation of the chains from molecule to molecule. This work establishes the molecular geometry of a prototypical TDBC-silver plexciton, providing a structural benchmark for understanding geometry-dependent photophysics in hybrid exciton-plasmon systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In recent years, QA has gained increasing attention as a high-performance solver for combinatorial optimization problems.

In this study, the dispatch problem for such micro-mobility services is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling efficient solving through QA. Furthermore, the proposed formulation incorporates historical usage data to enhance operational efficiency. Specifically, customer arrival frequencies and destination distributions are modeled into the QUBO formulation through a Bayesian approach, which guides the allocation of vacant vehicles to designated stations for waiting and charging. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparisons to conventional formulations such as the vehicle routing problem. Additionally, the performance of QA is compared with that of classical solvers to reveal its potential advantages for the proposed dispatch formulation.

The spectra calculated from these signals show fringes due to interference between each stray light contribution and the nominal beam. The frequency of these interference peaks indicates the difference in path length between the stray light path and the nominal path.

Here, we investigate the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a 1D moir\u00e9 superlattice formed in twisted bilayer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$ using density functional theory calculations, complemented by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. We show that lattice relaxation strongly reconstructs the moir\u00e9 stripes, leading to stacking-dependent stripe widths that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The relaxed structure hosts quasi-one-dimensional electronic bands near the Fermi level, characterized by strong dispersion along the stripe direction and nearly flat dispersion in the perpendicular direction. By comparing the full bilayer with isolated relaxed layers, we establish that these 1D electronic states are governed predominantly by an intralayer moir\u00e9 potential induced by in-plane lattice relaxation, rather than by interlayer hybridization. We extract this position-dependent moir\u00e9 potential directly from DFT calculations and construct an effective tight-binding model that reproduces both the band dispersion and the real-space localization of the electronic wave functions. Our results identify lattice relaxation as the key mechanism underlying 1D electronic states in 1D moir\u00e9 superlattices. %and establish twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring emergent one-dimensional moir\u00e9 physics.

The methyl radical, which is produced by $267\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ photodissociation of methyl iodide, is excited to high levels in its $\u03bd_2$ ``umbrella\" vibrational mode by the dissociation. The ensuing coherent vibrational dynamics are observed by measuring ultrafast time-dependent changes in the x-ray transition energy from the C$1s$ to the singly-occupied valence orbital. Due to symmetry, the real space vibrational motion appears predominantly in the x-ray energy shift at the difference frequencies of the $\u03bd_2$ progression, although the fundamental frequencies of the $\u03bd_2$ mode are also observed. By constructing a fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics the coherent superposition is rigorously characterized and the real-space motion of the radicals is reconstructed. The retrieved trajectories are dominated by pronounced quantum beating governed by the high degree of coherent excitation and the strong negative anharmonicity of the $\u03bd_2$ mode.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u89e3\u79bb\u7532\u57fa\u7898\u5f97\u5230\u7532\u57fa\u57fa\u6001 radicals\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7532\u57fa\u57fa\u6001\u7684\u03bd\u2082\u201c\u4e0a percentages\u201d\u632f\u52a8\u80fd\u6fc0\u53d1\u9ad8\u80fd\u6001\u3002\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u632f\u52a8\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u4e3ax\u5c04\u7ebf\u80fd\u8c31\u5728\u03bd\u2082\u8fdb\u9636\u9891\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5904\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5728\u57fa\u9891\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u03bd\u2082\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u7531\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5e72\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u5f3a\u8d1f\u975e\u8c03\u8c10\u6027\u03bd\u2082\u6a21\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50beat\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u89e3\u79bb\u548c applicant\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u2020\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5206\u5b50\u632f\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7532\u57fa\u57fa\u6001 radicals\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528 x \u5c04\u7ebf\u5438\u6536 spectroscopy (XAS) \u5b9e\u65f6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7532\u57fa radicals \u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u632f\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7532\u57fa radicals \u5728 \u03bd\u2082 \u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50 beat\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7531\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5e72\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u5f3a\u975e\u8c03\u8c10\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u5b50\u57fa\u6001 radicals \u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 x \u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5b50\u632f\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The central aim of this work is to understand how the standard narrative about the behavior of the spectral form factor is modified in the presence of these parametrically large number of ground states. We show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the spectral form factor is dominated by the disconnected contribution, even at arbitrarily late times. Moreover, we demonstrate that the connected form factor only depends on the eigenvalues of the non-degenerate sector. Using the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, we analyze a number of examples including the Bessel model and $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim supergravity. In these examples, we find damped oscillations in the disconnected form factor, with a period set by the inverse size of the gap. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the slope of the ramp in the connected form factor arises from a universal sine-kernel, which emerges from a truncation of the full non-perturbative kernel in the $\\hbar \\to 0$ limit, and find agreement with the leading double trumpet result. Finally, we present predictions for how the ramp will transition to a plateau in the connected form factor and demonstrate how the transition depends on the details of the leading spectral density of states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u4e14\u8c31\u533a\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u8d21\u732e\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u975e\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u51b3\u5b9a\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u8870\u51cf\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u7684\u5761\u5ea6\u7531\u6b63\u5f26\u6838\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u53cc trumpet\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u95f4\u9699\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u8c31\u5f62\u5f0f\u56e0\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u4f20\u7edf\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7 Christoffel-Darboux \u6838\u5206\u6790\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5982 Bessel \u6a21\u578b\u548c $\textcal{N}=2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim \u8d85\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u632f\u8361\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u5761\u5ea6\u7531\u6b63\u5f26\u6838\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e0e\u53cc trumpet \u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u975e\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u5f71\u54cd\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u8870\u51cf\u632f\u8361\uff0csin \u6838\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u5761\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u95f4\u9699\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u4e8e\u8c31\u5f62\u5f0f\u56e0\u6570\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\u88ab\u4fee\u6539\uff1a\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u7531\u975e\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u8870\u51cf\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u7684\u5761\u5ea6\u7531\u6b63\u5f26\u6838\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), or supercapacitors, energy density is governed by the accessible surface area of porous electrodes. Continuum models, built on first-principles transport equations, have provided critical insight into electrolyte dynamics under confinement but have largely focused on pores with straight walls. In such geometries, a fundamental trade-off emerges: wider pores charge faster but store less energy, while narrower pores store more charge but charge slowly. Here, we apply perturbation analysis to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for a single pore of gradually varying radius, focusing on the small potential and slender aspect ratio regime. Our analysis reveals that sloped pore walls induce an additional ionic flux, enabling simultaneous acceleration of charging and enhancement of charge storage. The theoretical predictions closely agree with direct numerical simulations while reducing computational cost by 5-6 orders of magnitude. We further propose a modified effective circuit representation that captures geometric variation along the pore and demonstrate how the framework can be integrated into pore-network models.

Tensionless strings sweep out null worldsheets in the target space and hence are also called null strings. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of tensionless null string theory beginning with the initial work of Schild, and continuing to the foundational work of Isberg et al (ILST) and then focussing on developments in the past decade.\n  Recent work centres on the emergence of the Carrollian Conformal Algebra as residual worldsheet symmetries of the ILST action and the identification of tensionless limit as a worldsheet Carrollian limit on the string worldsheet. Carrollian structures are used to address the classical and quantum aspects of the null string. In the classical theory, the aforementioned limit agrees with the analysis from the ILST action. Symmetries, constraints, mode expansions computed from both perspectives match nicely providing a robust cross-check of the analyses. We discuss closed and open null strings as well as their supersymmetric cousins.\n  The quantum null string comes with several surprises, the foremost of which is the emergence of three consistent quantum theories from the ILST action. We detail the canonical quantisation and the spectrum of the triumvirate of theories. We discuss the novelties of the quantum null theories and the effect compactifaction has on them.

As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u79bb\u632f\u6001\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u7387\u52a8\u529b\u6f6e\u7684\u632f\u8361\u6027\u6001\u5728\u53cc\u5b50\u661f\u6216utron\u661f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c1\u3002 tidal\u529b\u5728\u4e8c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f15\u8d77\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8017\u5c3d\u80fd\u91cf\u81f3\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u4e8c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f7f\u4e8c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u5fae\u6ce2\u65af\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u8017\u5c3d\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u4f7f\u4f59\u6ce2\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u73b0\u6210\u7684Current\u548cPlanned\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u51c6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u503c\u5339\u914d\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7LVK\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0b\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u524d\u540e\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a1\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u98de\u884c\u6ce2\u5360\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u51e0\u767e\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u3002\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u5468\u671f\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u6f6e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u5fae\u5206\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5e38\u7528\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u9891\u8fd1\u4f3c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e8c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u52a8\u529b\u6f6e\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u51c6\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u524d\u540e\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a1\u6beb\u79d2", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u529b\u6f6e\u4e3b\u8981\u5f15\u8d77\u65f6\u95f4\u5fae\u5206\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u5f02\u6216\u5468\u671f\u5dee\u5f02\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e00\u9891\u8fd1\u4f3c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u6027\u3002"}}

The classical limit is obtained by formulating the open quantum dynamics in phase space using the Wigner function and Moyal products, followed by a systematic $\\hbar$-expansion. We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity.

In this paper, we classify non-Fermi liquids that arise from q=0 critical fluctuations and characterize their universal superconducting fluctuations. The essential tool is the projective fixed points, which generalizes the notion of fixed points to fixed trajectories that take into account the incessant running of the Fermi momentum under the renormalization group flow. Based on the topology of bundles of projective fixed points, non-Fermi liquids are first grouped into seven superuniversality classes. Each superuniversality class includes multiple universality classes, which are further classified by the universal pairing interactions and emergent symmetries. Despite the pairing interaction generated by critical fluctuations, some non-Fermi liquids remain stable down to zero temperature due to the incoherence of excitations and the lack of scale invariance caused by Fermi momentum. Depending on the strength and span of the universal pairing interaction in momentum space, the emergent symmetry of non-Fermi liquids may or may not be lower than that of Fermi liquids. In non-Fermi liquids that become superconductors at low temperatures, the universal data of the parent metal determine the lower bound for the superconducting transition temperature and the associated pairing symmetry. In superuniversality classes that contain non-Fermi liquids prone to non-s-wave superconducting instabilities, the critical angular momentum above which pairing instability becomes inevitable is sensitive to the Fermi momentum, and the associated superconducting transition temperature oscillates as a function of the density. We use physical examples, as well as a toy model, to elucidate the universal low-energy physics of all superuniversality classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that this coupling hybridizes collective atomic excitations (polaritons) with phonons, forming polaron-polaritons -- the fundamental quasiparticles governing light-matter interactions in arrays of trapped atoms. Using analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations, we show that: (1) phonons can strongly enhance the decay of subradiant states, but also enable their efficient excitation; (2) transport of dark excitations remains remarkably robust even at low trap frequencies, except when a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons; and (3) motion reduces the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, however, we identify mechanisms that mitigate this degradation and restore reflectivity above 99% in some cases. Our findings lay the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to harness them in state-of-the-art experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u6613\u53d7\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u52a8\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u5149-\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5149-\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u65b0 chilled  \u8bbe\u5907\u5f00\u53d1\u5960\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u63a7\u6e29\u5668\u5f0f\u539f\u5b50\u9677\u9631\u548c\u5149\u6805\u9635\u5217\u5b58\u50a8\u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u8c03\u8c10\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e9a\u534a\u5f84\u6fc0\u53d1\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u6697\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u5f02\u5e38\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u91cf\u6fc0\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a99%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u5149-\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

[Phys. Rev. D 98, 126009 (2018)] have analyzed a gedankenexperiment where two observers, Alice and Bob, attempt to communicate via superluminal signals using a superposition of massive particles dressed by Newtonian fields and a test particle as field detector. Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u6e90\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u662f\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\uff09\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u725b\u987f\u6781\u9650\uff08\u7ecf\u5178\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2agedanken\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\uff08\u725b\u987f\u6781\u9650\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5fc5\u987b\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u3002 ", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7 gedanken \u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u6e90\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u662f\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u63a8\u8bba\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce phantom codes-quantum error-correcting codes that realize entangling gates between all logical qubits in a code block purely through relabelling of physical qubits during compilation, yielding perfect fidelity with no spatial or temporal overhead. We present a systematic study of such codes. First, we identify phantom codes using complementary numerical and analytical approaches. We exhaustively enumerate all $2.71 \\times 10^{10}$ inequivalent CSS codes up to $n=14$ and identify additional instances up to $n=21$ via SAT-based methods. We then construct higher-distance phantom-code families using quantum Reed-Muller codes and the binarization of qudit codes. Across all identified codes, we characterize other supported fault-tolerant logical Clifford and non-Clifford operations. Second, through end-to-end noisy simulations with state preparation, full QEC cycles, and realistic physical error rates, we demonstrate scalable advantages of phantom codes over the surface code across multiple tasks.

The large modal overlap near an EP intensifies gain competition, favoring single-mode lasing. Recent studies further revealed self-modulation closer to the EP that transforms the lasing mode into a frequency comb. Such EP-enabled comb formation suggests a previously unaccounted-for mechanism that overcomes the strong gain competition and drives a second mode to threshold. Here, using a Bloch coupled-mode theory derived from first principles, we show that the second threshold arises from dynamical couplings among the population inversion, the lasing field, and a dark cavity mode. The lasing-inversion coupling produces extra EPs, whose spectral structure governs switching among single-mode lasing and frequency combs with different repetition rates. This above-threshold mode-switching mechanism enables new opportunities for tunable photonic systems, including adaptive optical communication links and dual-comb spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48 display \u5b66\u671f\u0e34\u0e41\u0e2a demonstrating a soliton-based threshold mechanism for mode switching in lasing systems with closely spaced exceptional points proposing a natural explanation for controlling photonic systems including adaptive optical communication and dual-comb spectroscopy.", "motivation": "The paper discusses an interesting phenomenon in lasing systems involving exceptional points and mode switching, which could have implications for adaptive optical communication and sensing.", "method": "Derives a Bloch coupled-mode theory from first principles to explain the mechanism of mode switching and identifies the conditions under which the second threshold occurs.", "result": "The theory successfully predicts the behavior of the system, showing that the addition of extra exceptional points allows for mode switching between single-mode lasing and frequency combs with adjustable repetition rates.", "conclusion": " nightly achievement in understanding mode switching in lasing systems with EPs and opening new possibilities for photonic applications."}}

Focusing on density matrix dynamics, time-off-diagonal Green's functions, and time-resolved photoemission spectra, we benchmark RTDE against fully self-consistent Kadanoff-Baym equation (KBE) calculations, the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), and exact diagonalization for small systems using second order many-body perturbation theory. Using a driven two-band Hubbard model, we show that mean-field single particle density matrix trajectories provide a reliable baseline for RTDE across a broad range of interaction strengths and excited-carrier populations. Further, RTDE accurately captures correlation effects in the Green's functions, including long-lived oscillations and revivals that are strongly suppressed by the overdamping inherent to self-consistent KBE schemes. As a consequence, RTDE resolves rich non-equilibrium spectral structure in time-resolved photoemission, such as interaction- and population-dependent quasiparticle splittings and bandgap renormalization, which are largely washed out in self-consistent approaches, yet are present in the exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that RTDE bridges the gap between mean-field propagation and full two-time KBE simulations, retaining favorable linear scaling while capturing essential dynamical correlations relevant for ultrafast spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($\u03c7\\sim \u03b3^2$).

This can be overcome by aperiodic or chirped PPLN structures; however, such devices are typically custom-fabricated and not readily available commercially. In this study, we investigate an alternative approach to achieving broadband SHG by using a standard PPLN crystal containing multiple fixed poling periods. Broadband operation is realized by angle tuning the crystal relative to input beam in free-space. The effect of angle tuning is examined over a range of incident angles, and an 1.6x enhancement in SHG bandwidth is demonstrated. These results suggest a practical and efficient strategy for broadband SHG using standard PPLN devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study focuses on using standard unpoled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystals equipped with multiple fixed poling periods to achieve broad second harmonic generation (SHG) bandwidth through angle tuning, resulting in a 1.6-fold improvement in bandwidth without the need for custom aperiodic or chirped structures.", "motivation": "Broadband second harmonic generation is crucial for nonlinear optical applications, such as ultrafast optics and sources for second-order nonlinear processes.

While linear magnetic responses depend on the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor, the influence of generalized spin-rotation quantum geometries on nonlinear responses has not been established. Here, we develop a microscopic quantum-kinetic framework to elucidate how the Zeeman and spin-rotation quantum geometric tensors govern nonlinear gyrotropic magnetic transport in two-dimensional systems. We derive second-order gyrotropic magnetic currents and reveal a distinct geometric separation: the off-diagonal sector is controlled by the Zeeman symplectic and metric connections, whereas the diagonal sector is dictated by the spin-rotation quantum metric and Berry curvature. This identifies the spin-rotation quantum geometric tensor as a fundamental geometric quantity unique to the nonlinear regime. Applying our theory to massless Dirac fermions, hexagonally warped topological insulator surface states, tilted massive Dirac fermions, and parity-time symmetric CuMnAs, we demonstrate how specific symmetries selectively activate conduction and displacement channels.

Starting from the Minkowski vacuum restricted to an initial Rindler wedge, we construct several inequivalent transformation paths, including direct Minkowski-Rindler mappings, spatial translations, and sequential null displacements, and analyse the resulting particle content using Bogoliubov transformations.\n  In the standard Unruh effect, entanglement between left- and right-moving sectors across the Rindler horizon produces Gibbsian thermality, with both sectors described by mixed thermal states. In contrast, we show that null-shifted wedge constructions lead to a selective and non-Gibbsian form of thermality: only a single chiral sector develops Bose-Einstein-distributed occupation numbers, while the complementary sector remains in the vacuum. Along composite transformation paths, the global Minkowski state remains pure, and the induced states associated with null-shifted wedges are pure tensor-product states. The observed thermal behaviour arises from Bogoliubov mixing and modular time evolution rather than horizon-induced entanglement or Gibbsian mixedness.\n  These results demonstrate the existence of inequivalent purifications of thermal spectra and clarify the distinct roles of horizon structure, observer dependence, Bogoliubov transformations, and entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory.

In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\\sim \u03bb\\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{16\u03c0G}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\\frac{G}\u03bb$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity.

Neural-network quantum states, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), can efficiently parameterize individual many-body quantum states and have been successfully used for QST.

We introduce a parametric QST framework based on a hypernetwork that conditions an RBM on Hamiltonian control parameters, enabling a single model to represent an entire family of quantum ground states. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model, our HyperRBM achieves high-fidelity reconstructions from local Pauli measurements on 1D and 2D lattices across both phases and through the critical region. Crucially, the model accurately reproduces the fidelity susceptibility and identifies the quantum phase transition without prior knowledge of the critical point.

More concretely, the background is unstable when the matter entropy given by the species number of the effective field theory increases more rapidly than the geometrical entropy proportional to the apparent horizon area, since it contradicts the covariant entropy bound. The rapid increase in the matter entropy is proposed by the distance conjecture, which states that the time evolution of some scalar field along the geodesic in the field space brings about the descent of a tower of states from UV. From this, we find that for the quintessence model, the accelerating background having the event horizon is unstable, and the instability condition as well as the lifetime of the unstable background is equivalent to the trans-Planckian censorship bound forbidding the classicalization of the trans-Planckian modes. We also point out that the scale separation between the Kaluza-Klein mass scale and the Hubble parameter can be realized when the product between the increasing rates of the matter and the geometrical entropies is bounded from below, which is consistent with the AdS distance conjecture.

The ability to characterize these DoFs, as well as the hidden correlations among them, directly determines whether they can be exploited for quantum tasks. While various methods have been developed for measuring the spatiotemporal structure of classical light fields, owing to the technical challenges posed by weak photon flux, there have so far been no reports of observing such structures in their quantum counterparts, except for a few studies limited to correlations within individual DoFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a self-referenced, high-efficiency, and all-optical method, termed 3D imaging of photonic wave packets, for comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of a quantum light field, i.e., the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet. Benefiting from this developed method, we successfully observe the spatial-spatial, spectral-spectral, and spatiotemporal correlations of biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, revealing rich local and nonlocal spatiotemporal structure in quantum light fields.

This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Gravitational wave astronomy typically relies on rigorous, computationally expensive Bayesian analyses. Several methods have been developed to perform rapid Bayesian inference, but they are not yet used to inform our full analyses. We present a novel approach for doing this whilst ensuring that the Bayesian prior remains independent of the data, providing a statistically rigorous way to leverage low-latency information to accelerate the final inference. By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\\times$ for binaries with SNRs $< 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u524d\u5411\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u540e\u5206\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u5927\u4e8e20\u7684\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u524d\u5411\u5206\u6bb5\uff08simple-pe algorithm\uff09\u548c\u540e\u5206\u91c7\u6837\uff08posterior repartitioning\uff09\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u540e\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SNR\u5c0f\u4e8e150\u65f6\u80fd\u5e26\u67652.2\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8SNR\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the \"1s\"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This elementary setting allows both for curvature to develop around the bulk loops and both non-trivial boundary data and dynamics on the open edges. We study this system at the classical level and leave the detailed of its quantum regime for future investigation. Working on a single loop with two external legs, we show how the LQG Hamiltonian ansatz reduces to a pair of non-linear differential equations, similar to the cubic Schr\u00f6dinger equation, on the areas carried by the bulk links. We provide analytical solutions to this evolution equation, identifying oscillatory modes (bounded modes) and divergent modes (similar to bouncing cosmological trajectories).

We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation.

These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $\u039b$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $\u039b$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation.

To isolate correlation geometry from payoff optimization, we introduce the Hidden-Field Coordination (HFC) model, which enforces identical information access and no-signaling constraints across strategies. Using information-theoretic diagnostics, we compare classical shared-randomness baselines with an entanglement-mediated strategy based on multipartite W states and a strictly local Spontaneous Leader Election rule. Within the restricted symmetric shared-latent baseline studied here, increasing total correlation is achieved primarily by driving actions toward alignment (copying), which also increases pairwise coincidence (collisions). By contrast, the quantum strategy realizes a collision-suppressing coordination regime: it preserves global dependence while reducing pairwise coincidence below the independent (product) baseline induced by the common marginal distribution. This produces a geometric separation in the joint-action distribution. Classical baselines concentrate probability near the diagonal of action equality, whereas the entanglement-mediated mapping occupies an offset-diagonal region associated with relational roles. Accordingly, the entanglement signature in this setting is not higher correlation magnitude; total-correlation differentials can be negative relative to the classical copying optimum.

Depending on the setup, the detectors are positioned either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with their energy gaps chosen to satisfy the hierarchy $\u03a9_C\\geq \u03a9_B\\geq \u03a9_A$. Our analysis reveals that decreasing the detector-boundary separation leads to a monotonic degradation of quantum coherence, whereas the same boundary effect can simultaneously preserve and even amplify the harvested quantum entanglement. Moreover, when the detectors possess distinct energy gaps, coherence extraction is further inhibited; strikingly, such non-identical configurations substantially enhance the efficiency of entanglement harvesting and markedly extend the range of detector separations over which non-negligible entanglement can be generated. Nevertheless, the harvesting of nonlocal quantum coherence is achievable over a significantly broader range of detector separations than that of quantum entanglement. Despite exhibiting similar overall behavior, orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel ones in coherence harvesting, highlighting the quantitative influence of detector geometry. Overall, our study reveals a hierarchical distinction between quantum coherence and entanglement as operational resources in structured vacuum fields: quantum coherence is not only more readily accessible across space but also more robust than entanglement, whereas entanglement exhibits richer features and can be selectively activated and enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper examines the extraction of quantum coherence via three static Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a scalar field near a reflecting boundary.

Coherence is found to degrade more rapidly with decreasing separation between detectors and the boundary, whereas entanglement shows greater resilience and persistence.

The paper also highlights that orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel configurations in terms of coherence extraction efficiency, emphasizing the role of geometry in the harvesting process.", "conclusion": "This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of quantum coherence and entanglement harvesting mechanisms using static Unruh-DeWitt detectors. The findings demonstrate that quantum coherence is more readily accessible and robust against certain configurations compared to entanglement, while entanglement exhibits richer behavior that can be enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity.

Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $\u03b4(t_\\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V} \\gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $\u03b4(t_\\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $\u03b4_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $\u03b4_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of FVD collapse, quantify practical PBH-formation thresholds, and pave the way for precise predictions of PBH abundance from delayed FOPTs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u97f3\u57df\u865a\u65e0\u57df\uff08FVD\uff09\u55b7\u6c14\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f15\u529b-\u6807\u91cf-\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u591a\u91cd\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f62\u6210\u539f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u97f3\u57df\u865a\u65e0\u57df\u55b7\u6c14\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8d85\u97f3\u57df\u865a\u65e0\u57df\u55b7\u6c14\u5bf9\u79f0\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u7c7b\u578bB\u8d85\u4e34\u754cPBH\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u7c7b\u578bA\u6b21\u4e34\u754cPBH\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u4e0d\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6bd4$t_\text{H}/t_\text{V}$\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4$\text{\u03b4}(t_\text{H})$\u4f5c\u4e3aPBH\u5f62\u6210\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa$t_\text{H}/t_\text{V}$\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5224\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u7c7b\u578bB\u548c\u7c7b\u578bA\u7684PBH\u5f62\u6210\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8584\u58c1FVD\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\uff0c$\text{\u03b4}(t_\text{H})$\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86FVD\u55b7\u6c14 collapse\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5316\u4e86PBH \u5f62\u6210\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4ece\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684 FOPT \u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u9884\u6d4b PBH \u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f62\u6210\u539f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Many quantum optical phenomena can be characterized by the two-time quantum correlation function $g^{(2)}(t,\u03c4)$, which describes the photon statistics of emitted radiation. However, the critical task of determining $g^{(2)}(t,\u03c4)$ becomes intractable for large emitter ensembles due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of emitters. Here, we analyse and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods applicable to emitter arrays embedded within electromagnetic environments, which generally provide upper and lower bounds for $g^{(2)}(t,0)$. We also introduce corrections to these methods (termed offset corrections) that significantly improve the quality of the predictions. The optimal choice of method depends on the total number of emitters, such that taken together, the two approaches provide accurate descriptions across a broad range of important regimes.

We find dominant corrections to the Schwarzschild metric in all orders in the derivative expansion far away from the horizon. These corrections can be summed up in a closed form through EFT coefficients up to all orders in derivatives and to the second order in curvature. It occurs that such a summation is convergent only for localizable theories, making a direct connection between the graviton scattering amplitudes properties and the applicability of a perturbative treatment of an EFT of gravity. We further apply our results to logarithmic form-factors which appear in the 1-loop effective action for GR in four dimensions. We find out that the corresponding corrections to the Schwarzschild metric are stronger than those from the tree-level EFT operators. The developed framework can be extended to account for the corrections to the other BH solutions in GR, such as the Kerr metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u573a\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5bf9\u771f\u7a7a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fee\u6b63\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6240\u6709\u9636\u6b21\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u9879\u6240\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u6c42\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u53ca\u5176\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u6270\u5c55\u5f00EFT\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fee\u6b63\u5168\u90e8\u6c42\u548c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u9636\u6b21\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u79cd\u6c42\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u8bdd\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6270\u52a8\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u56e0\u5b50\u5728\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d1\u73af\u6709\u6548\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fee\u6b63\u6548\u5e94\u6bd4\u6811\u72b6\u5fae\u6270\u7b97\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u89e3\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u4fee\u6b63\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9\u5e93\u5c14\u89e3\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u3002"}}

Both the direct part and the tail are contributed by branch cut integrals on the complex-frequency domain, and the quasinormal modes correspond to poles of the Green's function. We show that these different components match the Green's function numerically obtained by solving a time-domain Regge-Wheeler code. In addition, the components of the Green's function also agree with earlier studies in Schwarzschild spacetime with small cosmological constant.

As the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states with extremely long lifetime appear around the resonant frequency and form a continuum band. In stark contrast to the fully disordered waveguide QED where all states are localized, we analytically find that the fraction of localized states is up to $(3-\\sqrt{5})/2$ when the modulation frequency is $(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$. The localized and delocalized states can be related to excitation in flat and curved inverse energy bands under the approximation of large-period modulation. When the quasiperiodic strength is weak, an extended subradiant state can support the transmission of a photon. However, as the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states can completely block the transmission of a single photon in resonance with the subradiant states, and enhance the overall reflection. At a fixed quasiperiodic strength, we also find mobility edge in transmission spectrum, below and above which the transmission is either turned on and off as system size increases.

Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations.

We consider time-dependent Newton ``constant\" $G$, the cosmological term $\u039b$ and non-conserved $T^{\u03bc\u03bd}$. The Bianchi identity imposes a relation between the energy-momentum (non)conservation and the variation of $G$ and $\u039b$. If the energy-momentum $T^{\u03bc\u03bd}$ is conserved then both the Newton ``constant\" $G$ and the cosmological term $\u039b$ either do not change or both must depend on time.

Near the critical regime, the control field is linearly ramped across the quantum critical point at a rate characterized by a quench time $\u03c4_Q$. Away from the critical regime, the evolution is designed to follow the threshold of adiabatic breakdown, which we characterize by an adiabatic coefficient $\u03b6\\propto\u03c4_Q^\u03b1$. As a consequence, the total evolution time exhibits a sublinear power-law dependence on $\u03c4_Q$, and the conventional linear quench protocol is recovered in the limit $\u03b1\\rightarrow\\infty$. We apply the OAI protocol to the transverse Ising chain and numerically determine the minimum value of $\u03b6$. We further investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics in the presence of a noisy field that can induce anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior, leading to more defects for slower ramps. Within the OAI protocol, the optimal quench time that minimizes defects obeys an altered universal power-law scaling with the noise strength.

Numerous protocols exist for benchmarking devices before running actual algorithms. In this work, we show that both physical and logical errors of fault-tolerant circuits can even be characterized in-situ using syndrome data. To achieve this, we map general fault-tolerant Clifford circuits to subsystem codes using the spacetime code formalism and develop a scheme for estimating Pauli noise in Clifford circuits using syndrome data. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the learnability of physical and logical noise from given syndrome data, and show that we can accurately predict logical fidelities from the same data. Importantly, our approach requires only a polynomial sample size, even when the logical error rate is exponentially suppressed by the code distance, and thus gives an exponential advantage against methods that use only logical data such as direct fidelity estimation. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in various scenarios using synthetic data as well as the experimental data from a recent demonstration of fault-tolerant circuits by Bluvstein et al.

Such capabilities are especially valuable for quantum sensing and computing platforms that already find applications in biology, materials science, and geophysics. A key challenge is the coherent manipulation of nearby nuclear spins, which serve as quantum memories and auxiliary qubits but conventionally require additional high-power RF fields which increase the experimental complexity and overall power consumption. Finding systems where both electron and nuclear spins can be controlled using a single MW source is therefore highly desirable. Here, using a modified divacancy center in silicon carbide, we show that coherent control of a coupled nuclear spin is possible without any RF fields. Instead, MW pulses driving the electron spin also manipulate the nuclear spin through hyperfineenhanced effects, activated by a precisely tilted external magnetic field. We demonstrate high-fidelity nuclear-spin control, achieving 89% two-qubit tomography fidelity and nearly T1-limited nuclear coherence times. This approach offers a simplified and scalable route for future quantum applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "A modified divacancy center in silicon carbide enables control of nuclear spins without RF fields, using microwave pulses and hyperfine enhancements, achieving high-fidelity two-qubit tomography and scalable quantum applications.", "motivation": "The paper aims to simplify and scale quantum devices by eliminating the need for RF fields, which complicates experiments and increases power consumption.

In this work, we explore how these circuits can be used to implement and harness qutrits, by tuning their energy levels and matrix elements via an external flux bias. In particular, we investigate the distinctive features of arrays of fluxonium qutrits, and their potential for the quantum simulation of exotic quantum matter. We identify four different operational regimes, classified according to the plasmon-like versus fluxon-like nature of the qutrit excitations. Highly tunable on-site interactions are complemented by correlated single-particle hopping, pair hopping and non-local interactions, which naturally emerge and have different weights in the four regimes. Dispersive corrections and decoherence are also analyzed. We investigate the rich ground-state phase diagram of qutrit arrays and propose practical dynamical experiments to probe the different regimes. Altogether, fluxonium qutrit arrays emerge as a versatile and experimentally accessible platform to explore strongly correlated bosonic matter beyond the Bose-Hubbard paradigm, and with a potential toward simulating lattice gauge theories and non-Abelian topological states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8efluxonium\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u8def\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5229\u7528qutrit\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u901a\u504f\u5dee\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u7ea7\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u5143\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684qutrit\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u8d85\u5947 matter\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c regimes\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd1\u90bb\u53ef\u8c03\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6563\u5c04\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u6d88\u6563\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86qutrit\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u57fa\u6001\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 regime\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1afluxonium qutrit arrays \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u5947 matter \u548c\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u62d3\u6251\u6001\u7b49\u8d85\u8d8aBose-Hubbard\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u73bb\u8272\u7269\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u7684qubit\u548cqutrit\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u5947 matter \u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u901a\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u80fd\u7ea7\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u5143\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c regimes\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u4fee\u6b63\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c regimes\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u90bb\u53ef\u8c03\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6563\u5c04\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u6d88\u6563\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0cfluxonium qutrit arrays \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u5947 matter \u548c\u8d85\u8d8aBose-Hubbard\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u73bb\u8272\u7269\u3002"}}

Although transmon type qubits are designed and manufactured routinely in the range of a few Giga-Hertz, normally from 4 to 6 GHz (and, at times, up to around 10GHz), achieving higher-frequency operation has challenges and entails special design and manufacturing considerations. This report presents the proposal and preliminary design of an 8-qubit transmon (with possible upgrade to up to 72 qubits on a chip) architecture working beyond an operation frequency of 10GHz, as well as presents a new connection topology.

The aim is to achieve average relaxation times of up to 1.9ms with average quality factors of up to 2.75 x 10^7 after trials, while exploiting the new advances in superconducting junction manufacturing using tantalum and niobium/aluminum/aluminum oxide tri-layer structures on high-resistivity silicon substrates (carried out elsewhere by other groups and referred in this report).", "AI": {"tldr": "Plan proposes an 8-qubit transmon quantum computing architecture with frequencies exceeding 10 GHz, backed by new high-performance topologies to achieve high-fidelity, compact, and scalable quantum computing.

Large-bandgap van der Waals materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) host stable room-temperature single-photon emitters with narrow linewidths across a broad spectral range. However, cooperative radiative effects in this system have not been previously explored. Here we demonstrate collective emission from quantum-emitter ensembles in hBN layers when the emitters are nearly indistinguishable and positioned within a sub-wavelength proximity. Using confocal microscopy and a Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) configuration, we identify both isolated emitters and ensembles activated by localized electron-beam irradiation. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a superlinear intensity enhancement and a pronounced acceleration of the radiative decay in tightly confined ensembles, with lifetimes approaching the temporal resolution of our experimental system (about 500 ps), compared to approximately 1.85 ns for single emitters or large, spatially extended ensembles. Complementary second-order photon-correlation measurements exhibit sub-Poissonian antidip consistent with emission from a few indistinguishable emitters. The simultaneous observation of lifetime shortening and enhanced emission provides direct evidence of cooperative emission at room temperature, achieved without optical cavities or cryogenic cooling. These results establish optically active defect ensembles in hBN as a scalable solid-state platform for engineered collective quantum optics in two-dimensional materials, opening avenues toward ultrabright superradiant light sources and nonclassical photonic states for quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528 hBN

This lively debate is deeply interwoven with the question of whether entanglement studies can prove the quantum nature of gravity. However, the answer to this fundamental question depends crucially on which hybrid quantum-classical theory is used. In this letter, we demonstrate that entanglement by a classical mediator is possible within the framework of hybrid van Hove theory, showing that existing no-go theorems on that matter do not universally apply to hybrid theories in general. After briefly recapitulating the key features of the hybrid van Hove theory, we show this using the example of two quantum spins coupled by a classical harmonic oscillator. By deriving the spin density matrix for this scenario and comparing it to its equivalent for a pure quantum system, we show that entanglement between the two spins is generated in both cases. Conclusively, this is illustrated by presenting the purity and concurrence of the spin-spin system as a decisive measure for entanglement. Our results further imply that quantum entanglement studies cannot rule out consistent quantum theories featuring classical gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While dual-rail erasure qubits have been demonstrated with a strong error hierarchy in circuit quantum electrodynamics, biased-erasure qubits -- where erasures originate predominantly from one logical basis state -- offer further advantages. Here, we realize a hardware-efficient biased-erasure qubit encoded in the vacuum and two-photon Fock states of a single microwave cavity. The qubit exhibits an erasure bias ratio of over 265. By using a transmon ancilla for logical measurements and mid-circuit erasure detections, we achieve logical state assignment errors below 1% and convert over 99.3% leakage errors into detected erasures. After postselection against erasures, we achieve effective logical relaxation and dephasing rates of $(6.2~\\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$ and $(3.1~\\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$, respectively, which exceed the erasure error rate by factors of 31 and 15, establishing a strong error hierarchy within the logical subspace. These postselected error rates indicate a coherence gain of about 6.0 beyond the break-even point set by the best physical qubit encoded in the two lowest Fock states in the cavity. Moreover, randomized benchmarking with interleaved erasure detections reveals a residual logical gate error of 0.29%.

This formulation yields a geometric characterization: optimal rank-one measurement vectors are confined to a subspace orthogonal to a state-determined Hermitian span. This provides a direct criterion to construct optimal Positive Operator-Valued Measures(POVMs). We then identify conditions under which the partial commutativity condition proposed in [Phys. Rev.

To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce error-detectable universal control of bosonic modes, wherein ancilla relaxation events are detected and the corresponding trajectories discarded, thereby suppressing operational errors on logical qubits. For binomial codes, we demonstrate universal gates with fidelities exceeding $99.6\\%$ and QEC gains of $8.33\\times$ beyond break-even.

It states that any logical operation on a $D$-dimensional topological stabiliser code that can be implemented by a short-depth circuit acts on the codespace as an element of the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. In recent years, a new type of quantum error correcting codes based on Pauli stabilisers, dubbed Floquet codes, has been introduced. In Floquet codes, syndrome measurements are arranged such that they dynamically generate a codespace at each time step. Here, we show that the BK theorem holds for a definition of Floquet codes based on locally conjugate stabiliser groups. Moreover, we introduce and define a class of generalised unitaries in Floquet codes that need not preserve the codespace at each time step, but that combined with the measurements constitute a valid logical operation.

A central question is how small a role quantum computers can play while still enabling provable learning advantages over classical methods. We study an especially restricted setting in which a quantum computer is used only as a feature extractor: it acts independently on individual data points, without access to labels or global dataset information, is available only to augment the training set, and is not available at deployment. Training and deployment are therefore carried out by fully classical learners on a dataset augmented with quantum-generated features. We formalize this model by adapting the classical framework of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) to the quantum case, which we call Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI). Within this framework, we show that even such minimally involved quantum feature extraction, available only during training, can yield exponential quantum-classical separations for suitable concept classes and data distributions under reasonable computational assumptions. We further situate LUQPI within a taxonomy of related quantum and classical learning settings and show how standard classical machinery, most notably the SVM+ algorithm, can exploit quantum-augmented data.

When using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, the framework's accuracy is found to be primarily dependent on the reference-state selection in the sQKFF algorithm, while maintaining computational efficiency.", "conclusion": "The framework developed in this paper provides a robust and efficient method for simulating and optimizing solid-state spin-qubit systems. It offers a clear pathway forward for advancing quantum technologies by enabling accurate and resource-efficient simulations on currently available quantum hardware."}}
