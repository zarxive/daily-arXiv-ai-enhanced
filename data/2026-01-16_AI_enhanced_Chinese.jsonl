In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-Andr\u00e9-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{typ}}\\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-Andr\u00e9-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap.

The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin.

This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition.

A qualitative phase diagram is proposed to illustrate the combined effects of short- and long-range interactions, highlighting the emergence of distinct regimes with characteristic structural properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8154\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u548c\u6269\u6563\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e73\u79fb\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684Jastrow\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7406\u60f3 Bose\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528 Bose \u548c\u7406\u60f3 Fermi \u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u77ed\u7a0b\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u548c\u6269\u6563\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u9020\u548c\u5206\u6790\u975e\u5e73\u79fb\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684 Jastrow \u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7406\u60f3 Bose\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528 Bose \u548c\u7406\u60f3 Fermi \u6c14\u4f53\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u60f3 Bose \u6c14\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f31\u8c03\u5236\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528 Bose \u548c\u7406\u60f3 Fermi \u6c14\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u6027\u6d88\u5931\u548c\u65e0\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u77ed\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u540e\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u62df\u5c40\u57df\u6c14\u6001\u76f8\uff0c\u8be5\u76f8\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u77ed\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\u6001\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u7684 Jastrow \u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u4f53 ansatz\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002"}}

Rank-based diagnostics are commonly used in such problems to assess the effective dimensionality accessible to observation, often under the implicit assumption that rank deficiency can be resolved through numerical refinement. Here we examine this assumption by analyzing the rank and nullity of a bilinear observation operator under systematic tolerance variation. Rather than focusing on a specific reconstruction algorithm, we study the operator directly and identify extended rank plateaus that persist across broad tolerance ranges. These plateaus indicate stable dimensional deficits that are not removed by refinement procedures applied within a fixed problem definition. To investigate the origin of this behavior, we resolve the nullspace into algebraic sectors defined by the block structure of the variables. The nullspace exhibits a pronounced but nonexclusive concentration in specific sectors, revealing an organized internal structure rather than uniform dimensional loss. Comparing refinement with explicit modification of the problem formulation further shows that rank recovery in the reported setting requires a change in the structure of the observation problem itself. Here, \"problem modification\" refers to changes that alter the bilinear observation structure (e.g., admissible operator/state families or coupling constraints), in contrast to refinements that preserve the original formulation such as tolerance adjustment and numerical reparameterizations.

Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\\mathbf{q})$.

Earlier experimental and simulation findings suggest that these reduced-pitch GEMs can outperform the standard configuration in terms of effective gain, collection efficiency, and position resolution. However, a noticeable fraction of avalanche electrons is lost within the GEM systems, resulting in a degradation of charge collection efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive simulation-based study is essential to provide deeper insights into the extent of degradation and its contributing factors. In this context, we employ ANSYS and Garfield++ to model the Triple GEM detectors with reduced pitch sizes of 90 and 60 $\u03bc$m, and perform a comparative performance analysis with the standard configuration (pitch size: 140 $\u03bc$m). At first, the simulation framework is validated by comparing the results of the standard configuration with available experimental data and previously reported simulation outcomes. Despite the characteristic gain offset, the framework remains physically consistent and reliable in capturing microscopic avalanche dynamics, reproducing the experimental trend. Following validation, we investigate electron losses at the metal electrodes and within the Kapton holes, electron transmission through the transfer and induction regions, electron diffusion on the induction electrode, and the overall collection efficiency. These parameters are analyzed as functions of GEM potential, outer hole diameter, inner hole diameter, Kapton thickness, metal thickness, and gas composition, thereby offering insights for designing efficient GEM detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6c14\u4f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c14\u4f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528ANSYS\u548cGarfield++\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6c14\u5ba4\u5b54\u8ddd\u7684\u4e09\u6781\u6c14\u4f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5b50\u635f\u5931\u6e90\u548c\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6c14\u5ba4\u5b54\u8ddd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u7535\u5b50\u6d41\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u6c14\u4f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u6d1e\u84b8\u53d1\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5149\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u76ee\u6807\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u4fdd\u6301 Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u70ed\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u8bd5\u56fe\u6a21\u62df Page \u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u9ed1\u6d1e\u84b8\u53d1\u81f3\u4e00\u534a\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u51fa\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u6001\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u5916\u771f\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5f62\u5206\u5668\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7b80\u6d01\u5730\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u6d1e\u84b8\u53d1\u548c Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c Gaussian \u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5c06\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5f62\u5206\u5668\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u771f\u7a7a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u6a21\u9ed1\u6d1e\u84b8\u53d1\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86 Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u70ed\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Recent developments have indicated the existence of a `coherence advantage' in multimode optical communications, where partially coherent light outperforms coherent light. However, exploiting partial coherence in such applications requires manipulating multimode field coherence in programmable on-chip platforms. We present here the first example of on-chip synthesis and characterization of two-mode optical fields in an integrated on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Starting with incoherent two-mode light, we adjust the degree of coherence on the chip with non-unitary transformations, construct $2\\times2$ unitary transformations to synthesize prescribed coherence matrices, and reconstruct the coherence matrices via measurements of the spatial Stokes parameters. These results indicate the possibility of deploying programmable photonics for producing large-dimensional structured partially coherent light for applications in communications, cryptography, sensing, and spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u7845\u82af\u7247\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5149\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u975e\u5355\u5143\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u5e72\u5ea6\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u610f\u6821\u6b63\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u73bb\u8272\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u76f8\u5e72\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u5173\u952e\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u7845\u82af\u7247\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u518d\u751f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u7845\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5149\u5b66\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9a6c\u8d6b-\u6cfd\u9ed8\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u975e\u79fb\u76f8\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u5e72\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528 $2\times2$ \u7684\u9149\u77e9\u9635\u5408\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u5e72\u5ea6\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5149\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u573a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u7845\u82af\u7247\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u573a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5149\u654f\u611f\u4f20\u611f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u5149\u573a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The precursor signal relies on continuous measurements of the time evolution of tectonic stress, obtained by interrogating underground, with a high energy collimated muon beam, the piezoelectric fabrics present in quartz rich granite like rocks surrounding a known seismogenic fault in the Earth crust. Beam propagation through the rock across the active fault conveys to a detector at the exit of the traversal information on the amplitude of the piezoelectric field, which scales with the tectonic stress applied to quartz crystals embedded in the rock. The system, named ERMES (Earthquake Reconnaissance using Muon beam Evolution in Silicon dioxide), differs from other techniques under study detecting electromagnetic signals generated by piezoelectricity outside the Earth crust, as it probes piezoelectric effects directly inside the source region of the associated electromagnetic field, namely the near field within quartz crystals rather than the far field in open space. We present a focused analysis of muon beam manipulation after rock traversal and before detection using a newly conceived muonic lens, and we explore the maximum rock penetration capability of a high energy muon beam, reaching about 3 km of rock thickness for a 10 TeV beam. Owing to the peculiarity of muon propagation through such kilometer scale targets, we cross checked previous FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations with Geant4 to clarify the secondary muons role generated by primary muon interactions in solid matter over long propagation lengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, criticality-enhanced metrology through time-translation symmetry breaking in many-body systems, a distinct paradigm compared to spatial symmetry breaking, is a field still in its infancy. Here, we have investigated the enhanced sensing at the boundary of a continuous time-crystal (CTC) phase in a driven Rydberg atomic gas. By mapping the full phase diagram, we identify the parameter-dependent phase boundary where the time-translation symmetry is broken. This allows us to use a single setup for measuring multiple parameters, in particular frequency and amplitude of a microwave field. By increasing the microwave field amplitude, we first observe a phase transition from a thermal phase to a CTC phase, followed by a second transition into a distinct CTC state, characterized by a different oscillation frequency. Furthermore, we reveal the precise relationship between the CTC phase boundary and the scanning rate, displaying enhanced precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit.

By examining the Te-Te bond modulation, phonon dispersions, and electronic structures, we identify clear differences in how the two functionals capture the structural and dynamical properties of the CDW formation. r2SCAN+U reproduces the experimentally observed Te-chain distortions in the CDW phase and the phonon soft mode at qCDW=(0.4, 0.0, 0.5) in the non-CDW phase, whereas SCAN exhibits unphysical phonon behavior. The atomic displacements of the soft mode agree well with the experimental Te modulation. Despite their similar electronic structures and optimized lattice constants, our results demonstrate that r2SCAN is a more suitable choice than SCAN for describing CDW formation and lattice dynamics in CuTe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86SCAN\u548cr2SCAN\u6cdb\u51fd\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u94dc\u78b2(CuTe)\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u4ef7\u952e\u6ce2(CDW)\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0r2SCAN\u52a0\u4e0aHubbard U\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u57fa\u5e95\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6761\u4ef6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86SCAN\u548cr2SCAN\u6cdb\u51fd\uff0c\u6709\u65e0Hubbard U\u5bf9CDW\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u78b2-\u78b2\u952e\u7684\u6a21\u91cf\u3001\u58f0\u5b50\u8272\u6563\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "r2SCAN+U\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u78b2\u94fe\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u975eCDW\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u8f6f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800cSCAN\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136SCAN\u548cr2SCAN\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6676\u683c\u5e38\u6570\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46r2SCAN\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u63cf\u8ff0CDW\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6676\u683c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728CuTe\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) saturation decreases with current density due to a growing liquid pressure gradient. For all RH values, the CCL oxygen diffusivity increases dramatically with cell current due to progressive involvement of larger pores into the proton current conversion. Higher RH leads to higher double layer capacitance, which indicates that liquid water increases the electrochemically active surface area.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\\sim 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field. Although these energies exceed the observed upper range of cosmic-ray electrons, radiative losses such as synchrotron emission and inverse-Compton scattering can efficiently reduce them to the observed $\\mathrm{TeV}$ scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u78c1\u6027Penrose\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9Kerr\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u78c1\u6027 Penrose \u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u548c\u9759\u529b\u6781\u9650\u9762\u5148\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u503c\u540e\u6536\u7f29\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u5468\u56f4\u533a\u57df\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5148\u4e0a\u5347\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53SgrA*\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7535\u5b50\u53ef\u88ab\u52a0\u901f\u81f310\u00b9\u2075 eV\uff0c\u4f46\u8f90\u5c04\u635f\u5931\u4f7f\u80fd\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230TeV\u7b49\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8003\u8651\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3002"}}

Using holography, we present a fully microscopic description of these bubbles in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory at finite temperature. In the gravitational dual, these bubbles correspond to static, inhomogeneous and unstable black-brane solutions with a localized deformation on the horizon. We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios.

An analytical expression for the expansion can be obtained only if the interactions between the Bose-Einstein condensate and thermal atoms are neglected, resulting in a Bose-enhanced distribution for the thermal component. Here, the deformation of the cloud due to interactions and the effects on estimated parameters are investigated by simulating the expansion using a ballistic approximation. By fitting the simulated expansion profiles with a Bose-enhanced distribution, the errors of using such a fit are estimated, and the results are explained phenomenologically.

Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\\sim 1/E^2$.

Our work is useful for understanding the effects of electric fields in one-dimensional generalized Kitaev spin models, and provides a starting point for exploring the electric-field-related physics in two dimensions based on a quasi-one-dimensional approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u5e7f\u4e49Kitaev\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u573a\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6cbf(1,1,1)\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7535\u573a\u4fdd\u6301Luttinger\u6db2\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7535\u573a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd1\u90bb\u94c1\u78c1\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u6fc0\u53d1\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7535\u573a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76Luttinger\u6db2\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6cbf(1,1,1)\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7535\u573a\u4fdd\u6301Luttinger\u6db2\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7535\u573a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5411\u8fd1\u90bb\u94c1\u78c1\u8026\u5408\u5e76\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u503c\u5206\u6790\u7535\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7535\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8d77\u70b9\u3002"}}

Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528VQE\u3001SQD\u548cHI-VQE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5421\u54af-\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u590d\u5408\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86VQE\u3001SQD\u548cHI-VQE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5421\u54af-\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u590d\u5408\u4f5c\u54c1\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5206\u6790\u4e86HI-VQE\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "SQD\u548cHI-VQE\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5927\u578b\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cHI-VQE\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Using a numerical approach, we solve these equations for pressureless matter, predicting the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, incorporating late-time observations from Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ with SH0ES, and DESI BAO (Data Release 1 and Data Release 2), constrains the model parameters, revealing that $f(T, T_{\\mathcal{G}})$ mimics dark energy in the absence of a cosmological constant, presenting a viable alternative to $\u039b$CDM paradigm.

The model yields a present-day effective equation of state $\u03c9_{\\mathrm{eff}}(z=0) \\approx -0.664$ to \\(-0.693\\), consistent with observations, and partially alleviates the Hubble tension with $H_0$ estimates of 69 to 71.5\\kms.

Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way.

Time crystals have emerged as an exotic phase of matter, spontaneously breaking the time translational symmetry, and are mainly categorized as discrete or continuous. While these distinct types of time crystals have been extensively explored as standalone systems, intriguing effects can arise from their mutual interaction. Here, we demonstrate that a time-independent coupled system of discrete and continuous time crystals induces a simultaneous two-fold temporal symmetry breaking, resulting in a hierarchical time crystal phase. Interestingly, one of the subsystems breaks an emergent discrete temporal symmetry that does not exist in the dynamical generator but rather emerges dynamically, leading to a convoluted non-equilibrium phase.

Munday"], "title": "Casimir interactions as a probe of broadband optical response", "comment": "13 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Casimir forces arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations and depend on the dielectric response of interacting materials across the entire frequency spectrum. Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response.

By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy.

For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u539f\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\uff0c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u8be5\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u65cb\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65e0\u5e8f\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u963b\u788d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u65e0\u5e8f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u538b\u7f29\uff1b\u8d85\u51fa\u8be5\u8303\u56f4\u65f6\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u4e0d\u518d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u81ea\u65cb\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65e0\u5e8f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field.

We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\u03b1$ and the KR field parameter $\\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field.

We first develop a self-consistent electrostatic theory for layer charge densities incorporating charge transfer, which reproduces the experimentally observed broadened and bent charge neutrality region. When the substrate's band edge has a much larger effective mass than RMG, its carriers can form a Wigner crystal at low densities. This creates a quantum superlattice that induces topological flat bands in the RMG layer, which may lead to Chern insulators driven by intralayer Coulomb interactions.

To deal with the necessary resorts of the ordering of the two-electron integrals and amplitudes, spin-adaptation, and the O(M$^5$) contractions (with M as the number of basis functions) of a CC calculation, we suggest a strategy that uses both the reduced and non-reduced representation of the corresponding quantities and switches back and forth between them.

Our pilot implementation of the CC singles and doubles method confirms in test calculations for NH$_3$ and PH$_3$ using different basis sets that significant savings (of more than 20 compared to treatments without symmetry and about 5 compared to treatments using $C_s$ symmetry) are possible and suggest that the exploitation of non-Abelian symmetry would render CC computations on large highly symmetric molecules possible", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u70b9\u7fa4\uff0c\u663e\u793aCC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u5173\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u70b9\u7fa4\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u6709\u6df1\u539a\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u76f4\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u79ef\u5206\u548cCC\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u5206\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728NH3\u548cPH3\u7b49\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0cCC\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u5206\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8CC\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u70b9\u7fa4\u5c06\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking.

Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy.

Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes.

We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.\n  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction. Using an end-to-end experimental workflow, we benchmark our decoder on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 superconducting quantum processor on surface codes with distances up to 7, demonstrating its superior accuracy.

The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5e26\u6709\u51c0\u78c1\u7535\u8377\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5bf9\u5e26\u7535\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u2020 superradiant \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8fdc\u8d85\u4e2d\u6027Kerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u6e90\u4e8e\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u79bb\u5fc3\u529b\u52bf\u5792\u964d\u4f4e\u3002_this creates a\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u675f\u7f1a\u52bf\u9631\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u751f\u957f\u901f\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u73bb\u8272\u4e91\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u7684\u8fd1\u5355\u8272\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\uff08GW\uff09\u6e90\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u589e\u5f3a\u7684GW\u529f\u7387\u3002\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u8c10\u8c03\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4ece\u5317\u6781\u548c\u5357\u6781\uff08\u5bf9\u5e94\u76f8\u53cd\u87ba\u65cb\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u5728\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u4e00\u822c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u8fd1\u5706\u5f62\u6781\u5316\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027GW\uff0c\u800cKerr\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6781\u5316\u662f\u692d\u5706\u5f62\u7684\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u57fa\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u6d4b\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u548c\u8d85\u8f7b\u5b50\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u4f59\u70ec\u540e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u540e\u7eedGW\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u4e0eKerr\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u78c1\u9057\u8ff9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u4e91\u5e76\u7acb\u5373\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5706\u5f62\u6781\u5316\u53d1\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u7684GW\u3002\u4ee5\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u78c1\u9057\u8ff9\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u793a\u4f8b\u8868\u660emHz\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u540e\u7eedGW\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ec5\u5728\u51e0\u5468\u5185\u5373\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6781\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u692d\u5706\u5ea6\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0eKerr\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u4e00\u822c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u5706\u5f62\u6781\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6216\u8bb8\u51fa\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u6781\u7aef\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u548c\u8d85\u8f7b\u5b50\u6765\u4e30\u5bcc\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6709\u51c0\u78c1\u7535\u8377\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5bf9\u5e26\u7535\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u6d88\u9000\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u78c1\u7535\u8377\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u2020 superradiant \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8fdc\u8d85\u4e2d\u6027Kerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u5bfc\u81f4\u79bb\u5fc3\u529b\u52bf\u5792\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u6df1\u5f15\u529b\u675f\u7f1a\u52bf\u9631\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u751f\u957f\u901f\u7387\u3002\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u73bb\u8272\u4e91\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u7684\u3001\u8fd1\u5706\u5f62\u6781\u5316\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027GW\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u548c\u8d85\u8f7b\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase.

The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a barotropic cosmic fluid, and an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is obtained. Using the latest DESI DR2 BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets, we constrain the model parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \\simeq 69.5\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \\simeq -0.57$. The transition redshift, where the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration, occurs in the range $z_{\\rm tr} \\sim 0.56 - 0.77$. Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $\u03c9_{eff}(z)$. While statefinder diagnostic shows the model favours a Chaplygin gas like nature for DESI and DESI+CC, whereas the model favours as quintessence dominated evolution for P-BAO+CC in the late time regime.

While interference visibility in the standard two-photon case, known as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, monotonically degrades with higher intensity correlation functions, we show that this monotonicity does not hold for three-photon interference in symmetric circuits. We reveal that, in the discrete Fourier transform circuit, engineered super-Poissonian photon-number fluctuations, realized using a modulated laser, maximize the visibility, surpassing the magnitude of the single-photon signature. In addition, by tuning the symmetric circuit parameters, we demonstrate that the visibility hierarchy inverts relative to the benchmark of Poissonian statistics.

We establish that for a simple U-shaped string with only radial dependence on the space string coordinate, $x_r'(\u03c3) \\neq 0$, the string is generally not symmetric about its turning point, and the symmetry restores only for backgrounds with $h_{pr} = G_{00} G_{pr} - G_{0p} G_{0r} = 0$. Consequently, such asymmetric strings directly probe a possibility of the parity violation in the quark-antiquark interaction. Nevertheless, we identify a wide family of metrics for which the symmetry is preserved, enabling a direct isolation of the linear-in-distance term in the static interquark potential for simple symmetric string configurations, even in non-diagonal backgrounds. Applying the holographic framework, we further study the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma. We show that the distance between quarks decreases, the static potential between them increases, and the deconfinement phase transition temperature, $T_{\\rm dec} = (\u03c0/3) T_H = a_c/6$, increases with an acceleration. However, we observe that an acceleration-scaled potential as a function of the acceleration-scaled distance does not depend on the certain value of the acceleration This result, reflecting the scale invariance and self-similarity of the holographic setup, can be also obtained in the dimensionless metric after scaling of the coordinates onto the acceleration, $\\tilde{x}_i = a_c x_i$, for which one obtains an universal value of the phase transition temperature, $\\tilde{T}_{\\rm dec} = (\u03c0/3) \\tilde{T}_H = 1/6$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines static open strings in different spacetime backgrounds, analyzing their behavior and symmetry properties, and their implications for quantum chromodynamics (QCD).", "motivation": "Understanding the behavior of static open strings in various spacetime backgrounds and their implications for QCD is important for advancing our knowledge of strong interaction dynamics and testing theoretical models like the AdS/CFT correspondence.", "method": "The authors use a combination of analytical and numerical methods within the holographic framework to study the static open string solutions in different gravitational backgrounds.", "result": "The paper reveals that the symmetry of the string solutions depends on the spacetime background, particularly the condition $h_{pr} = 0$, and that these findings provide insights into parity violation in QCD and the potential for confinement in non-diagonal backgrounds.

Our results can be applied to experiments affected by third-order TIN, which we expect to be the dominating intrinsic source of noise in high-cooperativity room-temperature cavity optomechanical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5149\u632f\u8361\u5668\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u6781\u9650\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5149\u58f0\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5149\u632f\u8361\u5668\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002\u70ed\u6df7\u5408\u566a\u58f0\uff08TIN\uff09\u6765\u81ea\u6e29\u5ea6\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u6781\u9650\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u884c\u2018\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c10\u6ce2\u62b5\u6d88\u2019\u53ef\u81f3\u4e8c\u6b21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u62b5\u6d88TIN\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u819c\u5fae\u8154\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u534f\u548c\u6027\u4e14\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u6d88\u9664\u6240\u6709TIN\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u68b0\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7ea610dB\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6210\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53d7\u5230\u4e09\u9636TIN\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u662f\u9ad8\u534f\u548c\u6027\u5ba4\u6e29\u8154\u5149\u58f0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u5149\u58f0\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d88\u9664TIN\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u95f4\u819c\u5fae\u8154\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u534f\u548c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u6d88\u9664TIN\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u534f\u548c\u6027\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u6240\u6709TIN\uff0c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\u7ea610dB\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u9636TIN\u5728\u5185\u7684\u9ad8\u534f\u548c\u6027 room-temperature \u8517\u7cd6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664TIN\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u5149\u58f0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u9636TIN\u662f\u9ad8\u534f\u548c\u6027\u5149\u58f0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981 noises\u6e90\u3002"}}

Our proposal introduces a generating system for higher-spin vertices at the level of classical equations, which we refer to as irregular, in contrast to the regular case described by Vasiliev. This system extends the recently proposed equations for (anti)holomorphic interactions by incorporating the mixed sector. Its perturbative series encompasses the entire (anti)holomorphic sector in the leading order, with vertices related to powers of the complex parity-breaking parameter $\u03b7$ or $\\bar\u03b7$. The subsequent corrections facilitate the mixing of the two sectors, with vertices carrying mixed powers of $\u03b7$ and $\\bar\u03b7$. The consistency relies on the nonlinear algebraic constraint, which is shown to be satisfied at least in the quadratic and cubic approximations. As a result, the previously discussed (anti)holomorphic interactions in the literature can be systematically extended to generate vertices of the form $\u03b7^N \\bar\u03b7^k$ and their conjugate, at least for $k \\leq 2$ and any $N$.

While quantum cognition has successfully modeled such phenomena, it remains unclear whether quantum probability is merely a convenient assumption or a necessary consequence of decision dynamics. Here we present a theoretical framework in which contextuality arises generatively from physically grounded constraints on decision making. By developing a quantum extension of the Tug-of-War (TOW) model, we show that conservation-based internal state updates and measurement-induced disturbance preclude any non-contextual classical description with a single, unified internal state. Contextuality therefore emerges as a structural consequence of adaptive learning dynamics. We further show that the resulting measurement structure admits Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS)-type contextuality witnesses in a minimal single-system setting.

Our key result demonstrates that the sequence length can be reduced to exactly $2r+1$-only one additional measurement beyond the original non-fault-tolerant sequence, establishing a tight lower bound. The proposed method leverages cyclic matrix transformations to systematically combine rows of the initial stabilizer matrix and preserving a self-dual CSS-like symmetry analogous to that of the original quantum Hamming codes. This induced symmetry enables hardware-efficient circuit reuse: the measurement circuits for the first $r$ stabilizers are transformed into circuits for the remaining $r$ stabilizers simply by toggling boundary Hadamard gates, eliminating redundant hardware.

In this work, we characterize how noise on injected magic resources changes the classical simulability of quantum circuits and when it induces a transition from classically intractable behavior to efficient classical simulation. We adopt a resource-centric noise model in which only the injected magic components are noisy, while the baseline states, operations, and measurements belong to an efficiently simulable family. Within this setting, we develop an approximate classical sampling algorithm with controlled error and prove explicit noise-dependent conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Our framework applies to both qubit circuits with Clifford baselines and fermionic circuits with matchgate baselines, covering representative noise channels such as dephasing and particle loss.

However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations.

In this paper, we study the reliability function of entanglement distillation, which specifies the optimal exponent of the decay of the distillation error when the distillation rate is below the distillable entanglement. Furthermore, to capture greater operational significance, we extend the framework from the standard setting of known states to a black-box setting, where distillation is performed from a set of possible states. We establish an exact finite blocklength result connecting to composite correlated hypothesis testing without any redundant correction terms. Based on this, the reliability function of entanglement distillation is characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence. In the special case of a pure initial state, our result reduces to the error exponent for entanglement concentration derived by Hayashi et al. in 2003. Given full prior knowledge of the state, we construct a concrete optimal distillation protocol. Additionally, we analyze the strong converse exponent of entanglement distillation.

Instead of abstract quantum channels, we consider multi-qubit registers coupled to bosonic thermal environments, derive a second-order master equation for the reduced dynamics, and use it to benchmark the five-qubit, Steane, and toric codes under local and collective noise. We compute state fidelities for logical qubits as functions of coupling strength, bath temperature, and the number of correction cycles. In the low-temperature regime, we find that repeated error-correction with the five-qubit code strongly suppresses decoherence and relaxation, while in the high-temperature regime, thermal excitations dominate the dynamics and reduce the benefit of all codes, though the five-qubit code still outperforms the Steane and toric codes. For two-qubit Werner states, we identify a critical evolution time before which QEC does not improve fidelity, and this time increases as entanglement grows. After this critical time, QEC does improve fidelity. Comparative analysis further reveals that the five-qubit code (the smallest perfect code) offers consistently higher fidelities than topological and concatenated architectures in these open-system settings.

Unlike conventional channel discrimination, we consider a framework where the sender, Alice, selects the channel input adversarially to minimize Bob's distinguishability. We analyze this problem across four settings based on whether Alice employs i.i.d. or general inputs and whether the receiver, Bob, is informed of the specific input choice (allowing his measurement to depend on the input). We characterize the Stein exponents for each setting and reveal a striking distinction in behavior: for QQ channels with i.i.d. inputs, Bob's knowledge of the input significantly enhances distinguishability, yet this advantage vanishes when general inputs are permitted. In contrast, for CQ channels, Bob being informed provides a consistent advantage over the corresponding entanglement-breaking channels for both i.i.d. and general inputs.

Benchmarking the level of indistinguishability of these photons is essential for scalability. The Hong-Ou-Mandel dip provides a benchmark for the indistinguishability between two photons, and extending this test to the multi-photon setting has so far resulted in a protocol that computes the genuine n-photon indistinguishability (GI). However, this protocol has a sample complexity that increases exponentially with the number of input photons for an estimation of GI up to a given additive error. To address this problem, we introduce new theorems that strengthen our understanding of the relationship between distinguishability and the suppression laws of the quantum Fourier transform interferometer (QFT). Building on this, we propose a protocol using the QFT for benchmarking GI that achieves constant sample complexity for the estimation of GI up to a given additive error for prime photon numbers, and sub-polynomial scaling otherwise, representing an exponential improvement over the state of the art. We prove the optimality of our protocol in many relevant scenarios and validate our approach experimentally on Quandela's reconfigurable photonic quantum processor, where we observe a clear advantage in runtime and precision over the state of the art.

An analytical model is proposed that describes the interaction of two radiation components with an atomic system using a $\u039b$ scheme and takes into account an additional level of excited state. Both weak and strong coupling regimes with off-resonant transitions are considered. It is shown that, in addition to the conventional dynamic Stark shift, an extra shift arises due to the distortion of the resonance line shape when bichromatic laser radiation interacts with off-resonant atomic transitions. An analytical expression for this additional shift is derived in the weak-coupling limit, and its significant impact on the resonance shape and sensitivity to the intensities of the laser field components is demonstrated. It is found that under strong coupling conditions, the additional shift can deviate substantially from a linear dependence on light intensity, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light shifts in precision atomic devices such as quantum frequency standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5149\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u4eba\u53e3\u6355\u83b7\u8dc3\u8fc1\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7528\u039b\u65b9\u6848\u63cf\u8ff0\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4e24\u79cd\u8f90\u5c04\u6210\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u80fd\u7ea7\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u5f31\u548c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u975e\u5171\u632f\u5149\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u52a8\u529b Stark \u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd8\u7531\u4e8e\u53cc\u8272\u6fc0\u5149\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0e\u975e\u5171\u632f\u539f\u5b50\u8fc7\u6e21\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u3002\u5728\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5171\u632f\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u5bf9\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u5206\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0e\u5149\u5f3a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u88ab\u6253\u7834\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u88c5\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u6807\u51c6\uff09 controlling \u5149\u4f4d\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u4f4d\u79fb\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9677\u9631\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u039b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e24\u8272\u5149\u573a\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u3002", "result": "1. \u53e6\u5916\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u989d\u5916\u4f4d\u79fb\u30022. \u5f31\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0e\u5149\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u30023. \u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u88c5\u7f6e\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u039b\u578b\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u5149\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Here we demonstrate a hardware-efficient Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR) that implements continuous, measurement-free cooling of a superconducting cavity mode. A strong resonant Rabi drive on a transmon, together with sideband drives on the memory and readout modes detuned by the Rabi frequency, converts the dispersive interaction into an effective Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the qubit dressed states and each mode. This realizes a tunable dissipation channel from the memory to the cold readout bath. Crucially, the engineered coupling scales with the qubit-mode dispersive interaction and the drive amplitude, rather than with the intermode cross-Kerr, enabling fast cooling even in very weakly coupled architectures that deliberately suppress direct mode-mode coupling. We demonstrate RDR of a single photon with a decay time of $1.2 \u03bcs$, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the intrinsic lifetime.

Quantum violations of the classical TUR reveal genuinely quantum thermodynamic effects, which are essential for improving performance and enabling optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we analyze the TUR in a class of paradigmatic quantum thermal-machine models whose operation is enabled by coherent coupling between two energy levels forming a virtual qubit. Steady-state coherences are confined to this virtual-qubit subspace, while in the absence of coherent coupling the system satisfies detailed balance with the thermal reservoirs and supports no steady-state heat currents. We show that the steady-state currents and entropy production can be fully reproduced by an effective classical Markov process, whereas current fluctuations acquire an additional purely quantum correction originating from coherence. As a result, the thermodynamic uncertainty naturally decomposes into a classical (diagonal) contribution and a coherent contribution. The latter becomes negative under resonant conditions and reaches its minimum at the coupling strength that maximizes steady-state coherence.

Several architectures based on shuttling have been proposed; it has been suggested that singlet-triplet (dual-spin) qubits could be optimal for the highest shuttling fidelities. Here we present a fault-tolerant framework for quantum error correction based on such dual-spin qubits, establishing them as a natural realisation of erasure qubits within semiconductor architectures. We introduce a hardware-efficient leakage-detection protocol that automatically projects leaked qubits back onto the computational subspace, without the need for measurement feedback or increased classical control overheads. When combined with the XZZX surface code and leakage-aware decoding, we demonstrate a twofold increase in the error correction threshold and achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in logical error rates.

In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT).

We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\\partial \u03b8] \\in \u03a9(1/poly(N))$.

A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMFT applications, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to prepare the ground state of the AIM with shallow quantum circuits. The solver uses a unified ansatz framework to prepare the particle and hole excitations of the ground-state from parameter-shifted circuits, enabling the reconstruction of the impurity Green's function through a continued-fraction expansion. We evaluate the performance of this approach across a few bath sizes and interaction strengths under noisy, shot-limited conditions. We compare three optimization routines (COBYLA, Adam, and L-BFGS-B) in terms of convergence and fidelity, assess the benefits of estimating a quantum-computed moment (QCM) correction to the variational energies, and benchmark the approach by comparing the reconstructed density of states (DOS) against that obtained using a classical pipeline.

Specifically, the search approach is ineffective when the source and target states are orthogonal. In this paper, we employ normalization, orthogonality, and energy limitations to demonstrate that it is unfeasible to breach time-optimality between orthogonal states with constant Hamiltonians when the evolution is limited to the two-dimensional space spanned by the initial and final states. Deviations from time-optimality for unitary evolutions between orthogonal states can only occur with time-dependent Hamiltonian evolutions or, alternatively, with constant Hamiltonian evolutions in higher-dimensional subspaces of the entire Hilbert space. Ultimately, we employ our quantitative analysis to provide meaningful insights regarding the relationship between time-optimal evolutions and analog quantum search methods. We determine that the challenge of transitioning between orthogonal states with a constant Hamiltonian in a sub-optimal time is closely linked to the shortcomings of analog quantum search when the source and target states are orthogonal and not interconnected by the search Hamiltonian. In both scenarios, the fundamental cause of the failure lies in the existence of an inherent symmetry within the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Grover\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fian\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u6b63\u4ea4\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u8fd8\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4Grover\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u6b63\u4ea4\u65f6\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fian\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u6b63\u4ea4\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5728\u6700\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fian\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e38\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fian\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u6b63\u4ea4\u65f6\u3002\u8fd9\u63d0\u793a\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fian\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6216\u91c7\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u91cf\u5b50\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

From a geometric perspective, each evolution is characterized by means of geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and curvature coefficient. Conversely, from the standpoint of entanglement, these evolutions are quantified using various metrics, such as concurrence, entanglement power, and entangling capability. Overall, our findings indicate that time-optimal evolution trajectories are marked by high geodesic efficiency, with no energy resource wastage, no curvature (i.e., zero bending), and an average path entanglement that is less than that observed in time-suboptimal evolutions. Additionally, when analyzing separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions between nonorthogonal states, time-optimal evolutions demonstrate a greater short-time degree of nonlocality compared to time-suboptimal evolutions between the same initial and final states. Interestingly, the reverse is generally true for separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions involving orthogonal states. Our investigation suggests that this phenomenon arises because suboptimal trajectories between orthogonal states are characterized by longer path lengths with smaller curvature, which are traversed with a higher energy resource wastage compared to suboptimal trajectories between nonorthogonal states. Consequently, a higher initial degree of nonlocality in the unitary time propagators appears to be essential for achieving the maximally entangled state from a separable state.

In this paper, we provide an exact analytical expression for the curvature of a quantum evolution pertaining to a two-level quantum system subjected to various time-dependent magnetic fields. Specifically, we examine the dynamics produced by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. To enhance our understanding of the physical implications of the curvature coefficient, we analyze the curvature behavior in relation to geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the complexity of the quantum evolution (as described by the ratio of the difference between accessible and accessed Bloch-sphere volumes for the evolution from initial to final state to the accessible volume for the given quantum evolution).

However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the logarithmic-depth barrier by moving beyond the standard circuit model and leveraging global interactions (native to architectures such as neutral atoms and trapped ions). Specifically, utilizing unbounded CZ gates (i.e. within the QAC$^0$ circuit class), we offer circuits for exact computation of constant-weight Dicke states, using polynomial ancillae, and approximation of weight-1 Dicke states (i.e. $W$ states), using only constant ancillae. Granted additional access to the quantum FAN-OUT operation (i.e. upgrading to the QAC$_f^0$ circuit class), we also achieve exact preparation of arbitrary-weight Dicke states, with polynomial ancillae. These protocols distinguish the constant-depth capabilities of quantum architectures based on connectivity and offer a novel path toward resolving a long-standing quantum complexity conjecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u5236\u5907Dicke\u6001\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5982\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u88ab traps \u7684\u79bb\u5b50\uff09\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u9650\u7ea7\u6570CZ\u95e8\uff08\u5c5e\u4e8eQAC^0\u95e8\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e38\u6743\u91cdDicke\u6001\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\uff08qubits\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5355\u6743\u91cdDicke\u6001\uff08W\u6001\uff09\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u6570\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5347\u7ea7\u5230QAC_f^0\u95e8\u7c7b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u7cbe\u786eDicke\u6001\u5236\u9020\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u4ec5\u9700\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u731c\u60f3\u7684\u957f\u671f\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u50cfDicke\u6001\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 Metrology\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0d\u8a00\u800c\u55bb\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4f4e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eQAC^0\u548cQAC_f^0\u95e8\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u9650\u7ea7\u6570CZ\u95e8\u548c\u989d\u5916\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 FAN-OUT \u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u5236\u5907Dicke\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u731c\u60f3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u8054\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8f6c\u77e9\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4f5c\u7528\u539f\u7406\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u7f57\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u4f5c\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u529b\u6e90\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054Correlations\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u8fd0\u8f93\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u573a\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5173\u8054\u548c\u8f93\u9001\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
