Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination.

This work provides a proof of concept for the use of resistive layer technology in gaseous timing detectors, demonstrating that robustness can be improved without compromising the excellent timing performance of PICOSEC Micromegas. Different resistive architectures and values were explored to optimize stability and ensure reliable long-term operation in challenging experimental environments. The prototype with a 10M\u03a9 resistive layer achieved the best overall performance, with a timing resolution of 22.900 {\\pm} 0.002 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.190 {\\pm} 0.003 mm, while charge sharing across multiple pads enabled combined timing resolutions below 28 ps. A lower-resistivity (200k\u03a9) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response.

The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\\sim 100~\\rm \u03bcm$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle. Conversely, two absorptive long-pass filters with cutoff wavelengths around 590~nm were found to block more than 99\\% of the scintillation light from PWO crystals, satisfying the calorimeter specifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we demonstrate the capability for continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity, enabled by precise control of Rydberg interaction over two orders of magnitude, through the use of microwave-assisted wave-function engineering. To characterize this nonlinearity, light storage and retrieval protocol utilizing Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency is employed, and the quantum statistics of the retrieved photons are analyzed. As a first application, we demonstrate our protocol can speed up the preparation of single photons in low-lying Rydberg states by a factor of up to ~ 40. Our work holds the potential to accelerate quantum operations and to improve the circuit depth and connectivity in Rydberg systems, representing a crucial step towards scalable quantum information

This compact single laser, single compressor implementation of plasma channels for electron acceleration stabilizes electron pointing and enhances energy gain without requiring modifications to the laser system, paving the way for broader adoption of the technology across user facilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5229\u7528L3-HAPLS\u6fc0\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728ELBA_beamline\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u6fc0\u5149 Wakefield \u52a0\u901f\uff08LWFA\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6c26\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a0\u901f\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u52305 GeV\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5168\u53cd\u5c04\u5149 Setup\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u675f\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bcf\u5468\u91cd\u590d\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe3.3 Hz\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6fc0\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u5373\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u52a0\u901f\u548cLWFA\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5149\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53 acceleration \u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528L3-HAPLS\u6fc0\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0813 J\uff0c30 fs\uff0c0.2 Hz\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u5bfc\u5f15\u6ce2\u5bfc\u572820\u5398\u7c73\u7684\u6c26\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u5149 Setup\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u503e\u659c\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u8f74\u5706\u9525\u900f\u955c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b00.2 Hz\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u9ad8\u8fbe3.3 Hz\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u7387\u675f\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u4ece\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u51fa\u53e3\u52305 GeV\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5355\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u3001\u5355\u538b\u7f29\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u7684\u6307\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u80fd\u5792\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u7b49\u7ea7 etc. facility \u4e0a\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7535\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u548cLWFA\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u5149\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd etc.\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u4f0a\u8f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6591\u5757\u51dd\u805a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u675f\u7f1a\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u89e3 Bound\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u968f\u80fd\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u89e3Bound\u6001\u53d7\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002 These findings advance Rydberg\u9635\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50many-body physics and\u63ed\u793a\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u96c6\u4f53\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u4f0a\u8f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728Rydberg\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6591\u5757\u51dd\u805a\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u548c\u89e3Bound\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u4f0a\u8f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6591\u5757\u51dd\u805a\u5448\u73b0\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u548c\u89e3Bound\u6001\uff0c\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u968f\u80fd\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u89e3Bound\u6001\u53d7\u52a8\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aRydberg\u9635\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50many-body physics\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u96c6\u4f53\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002"}}

In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We first establish the existence of fortuitous states in the $N=1$ theory, where the theory is abelian and trace relations are extreme. We then provide explicit constructions of fortuitous states at $N=2$. We find fortuitous states both at weak coupling, in direct parallel to what has been done in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, but we also find additional fortuitous states at $k=2$, which is in the strongly coupled regime.

For tackling electron flux and metabolic pathway regulation, a hybrid material (nano-capattery (NC)) was developed based on cobalt-iron-nitrogen doped biochar (Co-Fe-NBC). The NC possessed both the capacitor property (287.91 F/g) and battery-like charge storage 38.3 mC/g with the highest energy density of 159.95 mWh/g. These properties existed due to its Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox cycle ability, a highly porous surface (291.81 m2/g BET surface area) caused by the defects (AD/AG 3.13) and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) observed through electro paramagnetic resonance. During PFHP, there is an 85% reduction in propionic acid, a 65.3% record electron management efficiency, an improved 1.34 NAD+/NADH ratio, along with a 87% increase in dehydrogenase activity, confirming the superior role of NC in efficient regulation of the metabolic pathway and electron flux management. These exceptional properties of biochar-based NC raised the cumulative hydrogen production from 151.03 mL (control) to 589.54 mL, which was an enormous increase of 367%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In 1D arrays, the frequency variation tolerance decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the element number. In 2D arrays, as the number of columns is increased while keeping the number of elements per column constant, the frequency variation tolerance increases for small number of columns, reaches a maximum at square configuration, and then decreases with increasing number of columns. The element-number dependence in 2D arrays is smaller than that in 1D arrays.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u7ec4\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a'THz\u632f\u8361\u5668'\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e92\u9501\u6027\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u6392\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u8026\u5408\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7684\u6700\u5927\u9608\u503c\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u968f\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5448\u53cd\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u5217\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u5148\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5230\u8fbe\u5e73\u65b9\u914d\u7f6e\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u6bd4\u4e00\u7ef4\u7684\u8981\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "Terahertz\u6280\u672f\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u3001 sensing\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7814\u7a76'THz\u632f\u8361\u5668'\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790; \u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u7ef4\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790; \u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6392\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5355\u884c\u3001\u591a\u884c\uff09\u4e0b\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u5bb9\u9650\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5bb9\u9650\u968f\u7740\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5448\u53cd\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u5bb9\u9650\u968f\u7740\u5217\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u5148\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u8fbe\u5cf0\u503c\u540e\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u4e92\u9501\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316'THz\u632f\u8361\u5668'\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.\n  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.\n  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LDPC\u7801\u5728\u76f8\u4f4d\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u5de7\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u70b9\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0 frustration-free \u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u5eb8\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u8054\u7ed3\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7LDPC\u7801\u7684Tanner\u56fe\u5e94\u7528\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u53d8gap\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u901a\u5c0f\u8bf4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u6469\u64e6\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u3002", "conclusion": "LDPC\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Most of such gyroscopes rely on electrostatic actuators with nanometer-scale air gaps$\\unicode{x2013}$an architecture that enables large particle velocities in a proof mass and, consequently, high Coriolis-force sensitivity to angular velocity$\\unicode{x2013}$but is inherently susceptible to damage under shock and vibration. This vulnerability is typically mitigated by purposely reducing gyroscopic sensitivity, thereby compromising readout accuracy. Microacoustic gyroscopes, by contrast, offer greater resilience to shock and vibration but currently exhibit significantly lower sensitivities. This limitation stems from the low dynamic compliance of the modes they employ$\\unicode{x2013}$typically Lamb or Rayleigh modes$\\unicode{x2013}$which restricts their maximum achievable particle velocity. This work presents a piezoelectric microacoustic device that overcomes this fundamental constraint by harnessing a topological interface state at the boundary between two microscale metamaterial structures. We theoretically and experimentally show that this state exhibits much higher modal compliance than Lamb or Rayleigh modes.

However, molecular insights into these interactions are lacking due to the absence of force field parameters for Se-S containing compounds. In this study, we present force field parameters for selenenyl sulfides with a phenyl selenide backbone developed using the General Amber Force Field (GAFF).

This formalism utilized both Coulomb continuum and confluent hypergeometric functions to describe the scattering states involved. Single Differential Cross Sections (SDCS) were calculated for incident energies of 100, 150, 200, and 250 eV. The data obtained indicated a peak in the ionization rates approximately at 200 eV, with the ionization rate decreasing as the incident energy increased further. The diffuse radial nature of the 3s wave function is shown to increase the sensitivity of the ionization dynamics to the incident particle energy. Asymmetries in charge were also detected; specifically, at low energy of the ejected electron, the SDCS values for positrons were greater than the corresponding values for electrons; however, as the energy of the incident particles was increased, these differences disappeared, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the FBA at high energy limits. The residual differences at low energy were due to the omission of exchange and post-collision interactions from the model.

If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra.

However, no single error-correcting code supports a fully transversal and therefore fault-tolerant implementation of all gates required for universal quantum computation. Code switching addresses this limitation by moving quantum information between different codes that, together, support a universal gate set. Unfortunately, each switch is costly-adding time and space overhead and increasing the logical error rate. Minimizing the number of switching operations is, therefore, essential for quantum computations using code switching. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the number of code switches required to run a given quantum circuit. We show that this problem can be solved efficiently in polynomial time by reducing it to a minimum-cut instance on a graph derived from the circuit. Our formulation is flexible and can incorporate additional considerations, such as reducing depth overhead by preferring switches during idle periods or biasing the compilation to favor one code over another.

We show that these correlators are dual to configurations of giant gravitons in the bulk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u56db\u7ef4N=4\u8d85\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u5076\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5f15\u529b holographic \u5bf9\u5076\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u96f6't Hooft\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9876\u90e8\u793a\u4f8b\u7684holography\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684 holographic\u5b57\u5178\u5728D\u819c\u4e0a\u7ed5\u7740\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6563\u5c04\u5e45\u5ea6\u6240\u9700\u7684D\u819c\u5185\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7b97\u7b26\u751f\u6210\u7684\u534aBPS\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u5728 bulk \u4e2d\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5de8\u91cd\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7 holography \u5728\u96f6't Hooft\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u5bf9\u56db\u7ef4N=4\u8d85\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u5076\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u5f15\u529b holographic \u5bf9\u5076\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728 Bulk \u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5f15\u529b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u5230 D\u819c\u7684\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b D\u819c\u7ed5\u7740\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0 holographic \u5bf9\u5076\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86D\u819c\u5185\u5b50\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6563\u5c04\u5e45\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u7684 holographic \u5bf9\u5076\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a Bulk \u4e2d\u5de8\u91cd\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u96f6't Hooft\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u56db\u7ef4N=4\u8d85\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u7684 holographic \u5bf9\u5076\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6784\u9020\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 D\u819c\u548c\u5de8\u91cd\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e Bulk \u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86 holographic \u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

These techniques typically require high optical intensities to increase the strength of the nonlinear interactions, which can perturb native biochemistry and damage or kill living samples. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy visualizes the spatial distribution of molecules using a nonlinear interaction between light and chemically specific molecular vibrations. However, the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations is limited by the total photon dose that can be applied before photodamage alters the sample, and photon shot noise sets the minimum achievable noise floor for most microscopes. Here we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced SRS microscope that is more sensitive than an equivalent conventional SRS microscope by up to 8.3(7) dB in spectroscopy and 8.6(1) dB in cell imaging. These results approach quantum limits on sensitivity and demonstrate that quantum states of light are sufficient but not necessary to enhance the sensitivity of microscopy techniques that are limited by photodamage.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper demonstrates a novel cavity-enhanced SRS microscope that significantly improves sensitivity, approaching quantum limits, showing that quantum states of light are not necessary for this advancement.", "motivation": "The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional microscopy techniques, particularly photodamage, by utilizing nonlinear optical processes like SRS.", "method": "The method involves using a cavity-enhanced SRS microscope, which amplifies the nonlinear signal, allowing for higher sensitivity and reduced photon shot noise.", "result": "The results show an 8.3-8.6 dB increase in sensitivity compared to conventional SRS microscopes, approaching quantum sensitivity limits.", "conclusion": "The findings suggest that advancements in sensitivity for microscopy limited by photodamage can indeed approach quantum limits, highlighting the potential of cavity-enhanced techniques without requiring quantum states of light."}}

We first notice that the interacting models exhibit an even-odd asymmetry depending on the number of sites, $\u03b4$, over which the interaction ranges. The even case exhibits competing order, thereby making it numerically untractable while the odd case exhibits an exactly solvable point at $g=-0.5$ where the entanglement entropy vanishes. By introducing a swirling geometrical twist, we map our 1D $\u03b4$-range chains to a series of 2D $\u03b4/2$-width models. Our new 2D models possess a unique helical boundary condition, constructed from 1D chains with the end of one connected to the start of another. We propose that the phase transition in the 1D system can be understood as a finite-system size transition in 2D.

In their early, highly eccentric phases, these systems generate transient gravitational wave bursts during pericentre passages, separated by long quiescent intervals; we designate these signals ``popcorn EMRIs.'' We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation.

The low duty cycle ($\\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology.

Starting from a canonical model of parametrically excited \\textit{van der Pol-Duffing} chain of oscillators with nearest neighbor coupling, a systematic two-widely separated time scale expansion (\\textit{Direct Partition of Motion}) has been employed, in the backdrop of Blekhman's perturbation scheme. This procedure eliminates the fast scale and yields the effective collective dynamics of the array with renormalized stiffness and damping, modified by the high-frequency drive. The resulting dispersion shift controls which normal modes enter the parametric resonance window, allowing highly selective activation of specific bulk modes through external HF tuning. The collective resonant response to the parametric excitation and mode-selection by the HF drive has been analyzed and validated by detailed numerical simulations.

In particular, the non-commutative structure is controlled by Drinfel'd twists that are built out of symmetry generators that include the scale transformation. To achieve this, we construct a twisted differential calculus that allows us to identify the proper gauge-covariant quantities. We also show that our construction is equivalent to twists where the symmetry generators are implemented as active transformations of fields. As a consequence of our construction, the deformed gauge theories possess a twisted version of the original symmetry group. Moreover, at the planar level, the deformation is encoded just on the external legs of Feynman diagrams, leaving then the amputated diagrams undeformed.

Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers a promising non-invasive and stand-off detection technique owing to its ability to penetrate optically opaque materials without causing ionization damage. While many chemicals exhibit distinct spectral features in the terahertz range, conventional terahertz-based detection methods often struggle in real-world environments, where variations in sample geometry, thickness, and packaging can lead to inconsistent spectral responses. In this study, we present a chemical imaging system that integrates THz-TDS with deep learning to enable accurate pixel-level identification and classification of different explosives. Operating in reflection mode and enhanced with plasmonic nanoantenna arrays, our THz-TDS system achieves a peak dynamic range of 96 dB and a detection bandwidth of 4.5 THz, supporting practical, stand-off operation. By analyzing individual time-domain pulses with deep neural networks, the system exhibits strong resilience to environmental variations and sample inconsistencies. Blind testing across eight chemicals, including pharmaceutical excipients and explosive compounds, resulted in an average classification accuracy of 99.42% at the pixel level. Notably, the system maintained an average accuracy of 88.83% when detecting explosives concealed under opaque paper coverings, demonstrating its robust generalization capability. These results highlight the potential of combining advanced terahertz spectroscopy with neural networks for highly sensitive and specific chemical and explosive detection in diverse and operationally relevant scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e THz-TDS \u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c specificity \u7684\u9690\u5f62\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5168\u7403\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9chemical\u548cexplosive\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c THz-TDS \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u7684 stand-off \u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86 THz-TDS \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\u548cplasmonic nanoantenna\u9635\u5217\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8696 dB \u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u548c4.5 THz \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002\u5229\u7528 deep neural networks \u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u8109\u51b2\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728pixel\u7ea7\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8699.42%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u4e8eopaque\u7eb8 covering \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a88.83%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86 THz-TDS \u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c-specificity \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e THz-TDS \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In quantum field theory, the normal-ordered operator $\\hat Q$ represents the difference between the number operators of right- and left-handed photons. Previous studies have shown that its expectation value is not conserved for observers propagating in a gravitational field. Here, we show that this Noether symmetry can also be realized in empty waveguides with duality-preserving boundary conditions, and we quantize the source-free Maxwell theory inside a long, cylindrical waveguide undergoing both linear and rotational acceleration from rest. In the vacuum $|0\\rangle$ associated to inertial observers, we find that the expectation value $\\langle 0| \\hat Q |0\\rangle $ fails to be conserved for observers co-moving with the waveguide. In particular, frame-dragging effects induce a spectral asymmetry between the right- and left-handed field modes at late times. As a consequence, accelerated detectors co-moving with the rotating waveguide can detect photon-pair excitations from the quantum vacuum, exhibiting an imbalance between opposite helicity modes. This is a relativistic quantum effect, which shows that the classical conservation law associated with duality symmetry is broken in the quantum theory even in flat spacetime, provided we work with non-inertial systems. Our analysis provides a concrete proof of concept for testing this effect in analogue gravity platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the breaking of electromagnetic duality symmetry in non-inertial frames, specifically focusing on acceleration and rotation, leading to photon asymmetry and potential quantum gravity tests through waves in a waveguide.", "motivation": "Understanding the interplay between electromagnetic duality, acceleration, and quantum field theory in non-inertial frames is crucial for exploring quantum gravity effects.", "method": "The study employs theoretical analysis and simulations to examine quantum field theory under accelerated and rotating conditions within a waveguide.", "result": "Accelerated and rotating waveguides exhibit broken duality symmetry, resulting in a photon helicity imbalance at late times due to frame-dragging.", "conclusion": "This research paves the way for testing electromagnetic duality symmetry breaking in analogue gravity setups."}}

In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincar\u00e9 sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28halo\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u6781\u8d28\u6bd4\u5706\u5f62\u7ed5\u8f68\u9053\u53d1\u751f\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503ckludge\u65b9\u6848\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u548c\u56de\u73af\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6df7\u6c8c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5bbd\u9891\u8c31\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u5e45\u503c\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\u5305\u542b\u72ec\u7279\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u6df7\u6c8c\u548c\u975e\u6df7\u6c8c\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u9053\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6f5c\u5728\u88abLISA\u3001\u5929\u5bab\u548c\u53f0 unfit\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u51ed\u9ad8\u661f\u6838\u73af\u5883\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u73b0\u8c61\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6781\u8d28\u6bd4\u5706\u5f62\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503ckludge\u65b9\u6848\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u548c\u56de\u73af\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5bbd\u9891\u8c31\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u5e45\u503c\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\uff1b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u72b6\u6001\u5e26\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u6f5c\u5728\u88abLISA\u3001\u5929\u5bab\u548c\u53f0\u5de5uits\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548cDehnen\u578b\u6697\u7269\u8d28halo\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6781\u8d28\u6bd4\u5706\u5f62\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5982LISA\u3001\u5929\u5bab\u548c\u53f0\u5de5uits\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}

However, a basic query persistently remains for the complex liquid metal system: Is there a minimal functional unit that can fully capture its diversity of morphology and function? Cells, as the most basic structural and functional units of life, are small in scale but have complex structures, functions, and life activities. Analogous to nature, this article proposes the concept of liquid metal cells, and systematically explores their construction routes, sensing capabilities, motion behaviors, and potential applications. We first construct a multi-phase composite structure with liquid metal as the nucleus, ionic solution as the cytoplasm, and polymer as the cell membrane by developing a layered cryogenic molding method. Furthermore, we reveal that liquid metal cells exhibit inherently versatile responsive characteristics and self-adaptive behaviors to thermal, pressure, chemical, electrical, and magnetic fields, indicating \"small world, vast potential\". Based on these fundamental findings, we finally demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing liquid metal cells as sensors, fluidic valves, and material transport carriers in flow channels through dynamic control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These have attracted significant interest for the role they play in the device microelectronic operation and for quantum information applications. Andreev physics has so far been synonymous with the microwave range. However, the maturation of superconductor--semiconductor hybrid junctions opens the door to the characterization, and manipulation, of Andreev states by light. Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation. Given their natural microwave coupling, we show how Andreev bound states can operate as optical--to--microwave transducers. We illustrate these effects with realistic device parameters.

This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these.

We show that when the momenta of the middle two operators are spacelike, four-point exchange Wightman functions factorize into a product of three-point functions. This expression coincides with a Wightman conformal partial wave corresponding to the operator dual to the exchanged particle in the bulk. Further, we discuss and explicitly show how these results can be analytically continued to obtain Euclidean AdS correlators up to contact diagrams and avoid the need to perform any nested bulk point integrals in contrast to the traditional Witten diagram approach. We then translate our results to twistor space taking first steps towards a twistor space reformulation of four point Wightman functions. For conformally coupled scalars interacting with a cubic potential, we obtain a beautiful form for four and five point functions. For the interesting case of Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity, we derive a simple double copy relation.

Assaad", "Igor F. Herbut"], "title": "Phase transitions on the dark side of the Gross-Neveu model", "comment": "9 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity.

This enhancement is polynomial for Sobolev initial data and super-polynomial, but sub-exponential, for real analytic initial data. We further show that, when the expansion rate is the borderline $t^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ -- the rate which describes a radiation filled universe -- a degenerate phase mixing effect results in a logarithmic enhancement for Sobolev initial data and a super-logarithmic enhancement (in fact, a gain of $\\exp(-\u03bc(\\log t)^\u03b5)$ for some $\u03bc,\u03b5>0$) for analytic initial data.

We show that the shape of the potential energy surfaces can be engineered and controlled by exploiting the sideband transitions of the crystal vibration and dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Using the sideband transition, we realize a sloped conical intersection whose cone axis is only tilted along one spatial axis. When the phonon wavepacket is located in the potential minimum of the lower potential surface, the spin and phonon dynamics are largely frozen owing to the geometric phase effect. When starting from the upper potential surface, the electronic and phonon states tunnel to the lower potential surface, leading to a partial revival of the initial state. In contrast, the dynamics drastically change when the initial wavepackets are away from the conical intersection. The initial state is revived, and is almost entirely irrelevant to whether it is from the lower or upper potential surface. Complete Rabi oscillations of the adiabatic states are found when the wavepacket is initialized on the upper potential surface.

We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations.

Based on the above physical mechanism, the RL can be reduced to 12% and 0.2% by redesigning the gate structure or reducing the pulse amplitude, respectively.

The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation.

Sub-cycle pulses with CEP values of $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ selectively enhance or suppress distinct features, isolating holographic patterns and enhancing BSH fringes. Classical analysis reveals that the intrinsic chirp inherent to sub-cycle fields shortens the recollision time for scattering trajectories, thereby increasing the fringe spacing in FSH and BSH patterns, while simultaneously enlarging the ATI peak spacing associated with TDS interference. Pulse envelope variations, even at fixed FWHM duration, further reshape the fringe spacings by modifying the instantaneous frequency and vector potential slope near ionization times.

Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u538b\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9c81ropic\u954d\u9178\u76d0\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u5173\u952e\u5728\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u65e0\u538b\u4e0b\u5355\u6676\u4f53La4Ni3O10\u4e3a\u53cc\u659c\u77f3\u7ed3\u6784\u4f53\uff0c\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u4f7f\u53d8I4/mmp\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u7b49\u5f85\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u81f3\u7ea6135K\u3002x\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u8bc1\u5b9e\u76f4\u63a5\u53cc\u659c\u5230\u659c\u659c\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u65e0\u4e2d\u95f4\u659c\u5171CrPhase\u3002\u538b\u53d8\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u543b\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u76f8\u53d8\u4f34\u968f\u53cc\u8c03\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u968f\u538b\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u7981\u3002\u65e0\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u4e0bWi\u53d8\u5f62\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u53cd\u800cRaman\u8868\u89c2\u989d\u5916\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u591a\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u5355\u659c\u81f3\u53cc\u659c\u518d\u5230\u4e09\u659c\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u591a\u5c0f\u6ce2\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6750\u6599\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u6e90\u95ee\u9898\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u5965\u79d8\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u53cc\u659c-\u659c\u659c\u76f8\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u4e0eWi\u53d8\u5f62\u5173\u8054\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6709\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u538b\u529b-\u6e29\u5ea6x\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6676\u4e8f grown\u6837\u54c1\u3002\u7ed3\u5408Ab initio\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u538b\u529b-\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u53cc\u659c\u5230\u659c\u659c\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u6e10\u8fdb\u53ef\u7981\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528Raman\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6392\u9664\u4e86Wi\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cLa4Ni3O10\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u659c\u5230\u659c\u659c\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u76f4\u63a5\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u76f8\u53d8\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u53cc\u659c\u8c03\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u57281030K\u4ee5\u4e0b\u968f\u538b\u529b\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u7981\u3002\u65e0\u538b\u5904\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cRaman\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eWi\u53d8\u5f62\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u989d\u5916\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0eWi\u53d8\u5f62\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u538b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9c81ropic\u954d\u9178\u76d0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u53cc\u659c\u5230\u659c\u659c\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5173\u952e\u73af\u8282\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u662f\u534f\u8c03\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u5176\u5bf9\u8d85\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

These astrophysical scenarios are expected to introduce novel phenomenology in the scattering of particles and fields. Wormholes are viable candidates for exotic compact objects that can mimic some black hole properties. Hence, it is natural to wonder what would happen if the central astrophysical object were a wormhole, instead of a black hole. We investigate the astrophysical environment effect on the absorption of a massless scalar field by a dirty wormhole surrounded by a thick shell of matter. We study null geodesics around these dirty wormholes and analyze under which conditions new pairs of light rings can appear. The presence of new stable light rings allows new quasibound states in the spacetime, apart from the ones trapped near the throat. Thus, the astrophysical environment can introduce deviations in the absorption bands. Remarkably, although heavy and dense distributions of matter are considered surrounding the wormhole, the position of most of the spectral lines in the absorption bands is preserved, indicating that the astrophysical environment cannot hide some fingerprints of the central object.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Modelled as asymmetry with respect to a continuous transformation generated by a physically relevant observable, such as the Hamiltonian or angular moment, unspeakable coherence has been shown to be the relevant notion of coherence for achieving quantum advantage in the tasks of metrology, reference frame alignment and work extraction, among others. A question of both practical and foundational value is: Given some copies of a state with low coherence, can we prepare a more coherent state via coherence non-increasing operations? Here, we study this question in the minimal limiting case: Given two uncorrelated copies of a coherent state, can one, via globally coherence non-increasing unitaries, increase the coherence in a subsystem? We fully solve this problem for qubits, identifying the optimal unitaries and revealing the existence of bound coherence. This is then used to create a completely constructive multi-qubit coherence enhancement protocol, where only effective-qubit unitaries are used. Unexpectedly, in this protocol, we show that there exists states for which the ratio of the input-output coherence can be amplified unboundedly.

To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction.

The system and bath, together are prepared in the thermofield double (TFD) state, and we focus on the effect of modular flow generated by the reduced density matrix for the SYK system, obtained by tracing out the bath. We show, in the late time limit, that modular flowed correlators of two Majorana fermions, single-sided and two-sided, exhibit non-trivial singularities. Beyond a critical value of the modular parameter, the ``modular scrambling time\", the singularity structure shows correlations being transferred from one boundary to the other. The calculations are performed by employing the replica trick in Euclidean time and appropriately analytically continuing to real time. Exploiting the connection between modular flow generators and SL$(2,{\\mathbb R})$ boosts we use the microscopic picture to reconstruct the dual bulk modular flow in two-sided AdS$_2$ black hole spacetime. Fixed points of the flow allow to identify quantum extremal surfaces (QES) demarcating the entanglement wedge of the boundary system and the island.

Multimode fibers (MMFs) using space-division multiplexing (SDM) are promising for improved transmission capacity, connection flexibility, and security of data. However, the complex transmission characteristics of MMFs significantly hinder precise mode demultiplexing. Conventional approaches, including holographic measurements, phase retrieval algorithms, photonic lanterns, and multiplane light conversion, are limited by system complexity, size, and flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a purely optical, chip-scale AI solution for high-mode isolation, speed-of-light demultiplexing of MMF modes using a three-dimensional diffractive neural network (DNN). The DNN is trained with synthetic modal data and fabricated using two-photon nanolithography. It features a compact size of $120\u03bcm \\times 120\u03bcm \\times 80\u03bcm$ and a diffractive structure size of $1\u03bcm^{2}$ for the neurons at the hidden layers of the network. Experimentally, the DNN demultiplexer achieves a relative demultiplexing accuracy of over 80%. The AI approach of DNN allows for flexible design and overcomes the size and performance limitations of digital-optical demultiplexers.

In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model.

These quasibound states (and consequently the spectral lines in the absorption spectrum) can be related to stable light rings in the spacetime, a structure often associated with horizonless exotic compact objects, such as wormholes.

However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power.

In the example of a long wormhole with two asymptotic AdS boundaries and two compact extremal surfaces, we discuss the assignment of gravitational algebras to various regions bounded by the extremal surfaces and/or asymptotic boundaries. Using the split property, we construct type II algebras from the crossed product in the left exterior, right exterior, the middle ``python's lunch'' region, and their complement regions. We also study the case where only the area sum operator or area difference operator is included as part of the gravitational algebra. This can be achieved by picking the appropriate microcanonical ensemble, and these gravitational algebras can either be type II or type III depending on the region. In the case where we include only the area difference mode, the crossed product gives rise to a weight that restricts to a trace on the middle region.

Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims.

Yet most existing hybrid designs omit realistic finite-key effects on QKD key rates and do not specify how to maintain security when both QKD and PQC primitives leak information through side-channels. These gaps limit the applicability of hybrid systems in practical, deployed networks. In this work, we advance a recently proposed hybrid QKD-PQC system by integrating tight finite-key security to the QKD primitive and improving the design for better scalability. This hybrid system employs an information-theoretically secure instruction sequence that determines the configurations of different primitives and thus ensures message confidentiality even when both the QKD and the PQC primitives are compromised. The novelty in our work lies in the implementation of the tightest finite-key security to date for the BBM92 protocol and the design improvements in the primitives of the hybrid system that ensure the processing time scales linearly with the size of secret instructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hybrid QKD-PQC systems have potential but lack proper finite-key analysis and resilience to side-channel leaks.

The resulting constraints can be solved efficiently when expressed in terms of symmetric polynomials. Focusing first on the trace part of the modified gravitational equation, we determine the corresponding solution surfaces in Kasner-parameter space. The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $\u03b7= A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor. Its components are expressed in terms of three symmetric polynomials (of degrees $2$, $3$ and $4$) and depend on seven arbitrary constants, which may be interpreted as parameterizing different choices of the quantum state at the singularity. By imposing a set of constraints we reduce this parameter space to a single free constant. Subsequently, we solve, at leading order near the singularity, the modified gravitational equations.

Three-dimensional waveguide crossings, which distribute optical pathways across multiple planes, can achieve near-zero crosstalk and extremely low crossing-induced loss.

To address this challenge, we developed a low-cost fabrication method for 3D waveguide crossings by exploiting the edge rounding effect inherent to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Using this method, we demonstrate waveguide crossings with average loss below 0.002 dB and crosstalk below -62 dB on Ta2O5-on-LNOI integrated photonic platform.

Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $\u03bc$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor. These results show that a fast Rabi frequency, low charge noise, and a feedback protocol enable high fidelity in these Si-MOS devices, despite the low-frequency magnetic noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a300\u6beb\u7c73\u7845\u540e\u5207\u5272SOI\u6676\u5706\u4e0a\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u5171\u632f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u63a7\u5236\u5f88\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e865 MHz\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u62c9\u8d1d\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u9664\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u4e0e\u517629-.si\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u81ea\u65cb\u9891\u7387\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u81ea\u65cb\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7fT^{rabi}\u4ece7\u523011\u5fae\u79d2\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7fQ\u56e0\u6570\u8d85\u8fc750\u3002\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd4\u56de\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u4e00\u4f4d\u5355\u72ec\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea699.5\u00b10.3%\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u534f\u8bae\u5141\u8bb8\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u78c1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9bSI-MOS\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f4e\u9891\u5e72\u6270\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u6e90\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u81ea\u65cb\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001Coherence\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u95e8\u63a7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5916\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u5171\u632f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a300\u6beb\u7c73\u7845\u540e\u5207\u5272SOI\u6676\u5706\u4e0a\u5236\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u7684SI-MOS\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u534f\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u4e0e\u517629-Si\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u81ea\u65cb\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u81ea\u65cb\u9891\u7387\u548cCoherence\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95e8\u63a7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6210\u679c\uff1a1) \u8fbe\u5230\u4e865 MHz\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u62c9\u8d1d\u9891\u7387\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u65cb\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4ece\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f7fT^{rabi}\u4ece7\u523011\u5fae\u79d2\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u81ea\u65cbCoherence\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7fQ\u56e0\u6570\u8d85\u8fc750\uff1b4) \u968f\u673a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u63a7\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u4e3a99.5\u00b10.3%\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u6297\u5916\u90e8\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u5e03\u5c40\u7684SI-MOS\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u6676\u5706\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u63a7\u63a7\u5236\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6297\u5916\u90e8\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u8def\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5de5\u827a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $\u03bc_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \\cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism.

We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion.

We demonstrate the equivalence of the two approaches, revealing that the contour-deformation prescription in the functional integral put forward by Callan and Coleman directly corresponds to the outgoing Gamow--Siegert boundary conditions defining resonant states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u52bf\u5792\u7a7f\u900f\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u91cf\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u77ac\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u662f\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52bf\u5792\u7a7f\u900f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u8054\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u52bf\u5792\u7a7f\u900f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u52bf\u5792\u7a7f\u900f\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u51fd\u6570\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u56f4\u9053\u5f62\u53d8\u4e0e\u5171\u632f\u6001\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u52bf\u5792\u7a7f\u900f\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u91cf\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u77ac\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u662f\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u52bf\u5792\u7a7f\u900f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Due to their operating regime, their intrinsic linewidth is significantly narrower compared to bipolar semiconductor lasers. Here, we demonstrate that by implementing an external-cavity (EC) configuration based on a commercial diffraction grating, we have successfully induced a Fabry-Perot QCL to emit on a single mode with a broadly-tunable wavelength in the range 4.29-4.44 \u03bcm. This very simple setup enhances the laser's performance in terms of threshold current and emitted power. We further prove that the EC configuration positively impacts the laser's noise properties. In particular, the intrinsic linewidth is substantially reduced, the full linewidth is also decreased (depending on the integration timescale), and the relative intensity noise is slightly reduced. These characteristics, which hold within the whole tuning range, make the EC-QCL a good candidate for spectroscopy applications where broad tunability and narrow linewidth are highly demanded.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The signal's high signal-to-noise ratio ($\\gtrsim 75$) enables the detection of the subdominant $(4,\\pm4)$ multipoles, whose presence we confirm with higher evidence than previously reported by the LVK. Restricting the analysis even to post-peak data yields $\\log_{10}B\\gtrsim 1$ in favor of models including the $(4,\\pm4)$ mode, demonstrating that this contribution remains detectable well into the post-merger phase. We further perform three independent tests of general relativity, complementary to those performed by the LVK: a modified residual analysis confirms that our semi-analytical model fully describes the signal without detectable discrepancies; a subdominant mode test finds that the amplitude of the $(4,\\pm4)$ multipoles agrees with general-relativistic expectations; and a parameterised analysis of the plunge-merger-ringdown regime recovers the GR expectation within the 50\\% credible region for the remnant mass and spin, and within the 90\\% interval for the $(2,\\pm2)$ peak amplitude.

We compare the resulting $N=1$ supersymmetric action for eight 3d scalar multiplets to the $N=8$ 3d supersymmetric action describing the $D=11$ supermembrane in the static gauge. The two actions are not equivalent which is related to the fact that the full $N=8$ supersymmetry of the static-gauge $D=11$ supermembrane action can be realised only if the fermions are described by an $SO(8)$ spinor rather than vector. The two actions are still directly related in special dimensions $D=4$ and 5.

We develop direct methods to compute matrix elements of the $N$-operator, which we refer to as Magnus amplitudes, bypassing scattering amplitudes entirely. At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, with each diagram weighted by factors that we identify as Murua coefficients. At loop level this structure is augmented by the Hadamard cut function, and we establish remarkable relations between loop- and tree-level Magnus amplitudes. Among these, we find that $n$-point one-loop Magnus amplitudes are entirely determined by phase-space integrals of forward limits of $(n{+}2)$-point tree-level amplitudes, and hence related to Murua coefficients, and we generalise this to a class of higher-loop contributions. Furthermore, in the case of heavy particles interacting via massless mediators, we conjecture that Magnus diagrams that contribute to the classical limit are always given by forward limits of trees, and we show this explicitly in a one-loop example. We derive these results studying theories of scalar fields with cubic interactions, but our methods are applicable to general theories as well as to integral functions appearing in gravitational-wave computations.

Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions.

Our approach confines the periodic drive to specified on-site subspaces, creating an embedded kick that suppresses heating by preventing population leakage to inactive levels. We underpin DTC stability with a normal-form analysis that decomposes the effective dynamics into distinct components: the carrier locks the subharmonic frequency, neutral terms govern the slow decay and dephasing of the subharmonic response, and charged terms scatter spectral weight away from the locked modes. This framework's predictive power is demonstrated across various qudit platforms: in spin-1 chains, we enhance the stability of DTC by confining the drive to a subspace; in spin-3/2 systems, we show that robustness is dictated by the symmetry of the subspace partition; and in spin-2 platforms, we realize concurrent 2T and 3T DTCs under a unified drive.

Advances in nanofabrication have allowed precise dispersion engineering, unlocking octave-spanning soliton combs that are essential for applications such as optical atomic clocks, frequency synthesis, precision spectroscopy, and astronomical spectrometer calibration. However, a key challenge hindering their practical deployment is the intrinsic bandwidth-efficiency trade-off: achieving broadband soliton generation requires large pump detuning, which suppresses power coupling and limits pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies to only a few percent. Recent efforts using pulsed pumping or coupled-resonator architectures have improved efficiency to several tens of percent, yet their bandwidths remain below one-tenth of an octave, inadequate for applications demanding wide spectral coverage. Here, we overcome this limitation by harnessing mode interactions between spatial modes within a single microresonator. The mode hybridization creates an additional power-transfer channel that supports large pump detuning while maintaining strong pump-to-resonator coupling, enabling broadband soliton formation at substantially reduced pump power. Using this approach, we demonstrate an octave-spanning soliton microcomb with a record pump-to-comb conversion efficiency exceeding 50%.

This divergence is an artifact of the point-particle model, where the contribution of each multipole to the total absorbed energy is observed to be roughly constant. We show explicitly that this divergent energy arises from the infinite energy present in the singular static field arbitrarily close to the point mass, which also flows into the black hole when the particle trajectory crosses the horizon.

Our main goal is to identify similarities and differences between models in this family in regard to weak-field solutions. To this end, we use the effective source formalism to compare the related effective delta sources, mass functions, and Newtonian potentials. We obtain a variety of representations for these quantities in terms of series, integrals, and special functions, as well as simple approximations that capture the relevant dependence on the parameters $N_s$ and $\u03bc_s$ - which can be used to explore the weak-field phenomenology of nonlocal gravity. We explain why only for $N_s>1$ the Newtonian potential oscillates and prove that, despite the oscillations, the effective masses are positive. Moreover, we verify that these linearized solutions are regular (without curvature singularities). Finally, we also calculate the form of the leading logarithmic quantum correction to the Newtonian potential in these models. In all our considerations, we assume that $N_s$ is a positive real parameter. The cases of non-integer $N_s$ might be applied beyond nonlocal gravity, in effective approaches to implement quantum corrections in the weak field regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u725b\u987f\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u53ea\u6709\u5f53$N_s>1$\u65f6\uff0c\u725b\u987f\u52bf\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\u4ecd\u662f\u6b63\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u89e3\u662f\u5149\u6ed1\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f31\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u725b\u987f\u52bf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u6548\u6e90\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6e90\u3001\u6e90\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u725b\u987f\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u5f53$N_s>1$\u65f6\uff0c\u725b\u987f\u52bf\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u4e14\u5149\u6ed1\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c$N_s$\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u725b\u987f\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f31\u573a\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a classical quantum-inspired strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems with integer-valued decision variables by encoding decision variables into multi-level quantum states known as qudits. This method results in a reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations while inherently incorporating single-association constraints. Efficient classical simulation is enabled by constraining the system to remain in a product state throughout optimization. The qudit states are optimized by applying a sequence of unitary operators that iteratively approximate the dynamics of imaginary time evolution. Unlike previous studies, we propose a gradient-based method of adaptively choosing the Hermitian operators used to generate the state evolution at each optimization step, as a means to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm demonstrates promising results on Min-d-Cut problem with constraints, outperforming Gurobi on penalized constraint formulation, particularly for larger values of d.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u80fd\u4f4d\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u6574\u6570\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u81ea\u7136\u5305\u542b\u5355\u5173\u8054\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u7cfb\u7edf\u59cb\u7ec8\u5904\u4e8e\u79ef\u6001\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u751f\u6210\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u57c3\u5c14\u7c73\u7279\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6700\u5c0fd-\u5207\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eGurobi\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8f83\u5927d\u503c\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u91cd\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6280\u672f\u542f\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u80fd\u4f4d\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff08qudits\uff09\u7684\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u591a\u80fd\u4f4d\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u81ea\u7136\u5305\u542b\u5355\u5173\u8054\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u7cfb\u7edf\u59cb\u7ec8\u5904\u4e8e\u79ef\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u57c3\u5c14\u7c73\u7279\u7b97\u7b26\u751f\u6210\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6700\u5c0fd-\u5207\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eGurobi\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f83\u5927d\u503c\u65f6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f53d\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6c42\u89e3\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The simulations extend up to 150 ms which allows us to assess the role of the treatment of finite-temperature effects on the dynamics of the hypermassive neutron star remnant. Our study focuses on the analysis of the spectra of the post-merger gravitational-wave signals and on how these are affected by the treatment of thermal effects in the two EOS representations. Our simulations highlight distinct differences in the GW frequency evolution related to the thermal modeling of the EOS, demonstrating that deviations from established quasi-universal relations become significant at late post-merger phases. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the HMNS against convection. Employing both the Ledoux criterion, necessary condition for the development of convective instabilities, and the Solberg-H\u00f8iland criterion, a generalized criterion for axisymmetric perturbations based on a combined analysis of the Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency and of the epicyclic frequency, we show that differential rotation and thermal stratification in the HMNS give rise to local (yet sustained) convective patterns that persist beyond 100 ms after merger. Those convective patterns, while substantially different between tabulated and hybrid EOS treatments, trigger the the excitation of inertial modes with frequencies smaller than those attained by the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and are potentially within reach of third-generation GW detectors.

Commensurate driving, where the pulse length is an integer multiple of the drive period, can mitigate errors from residual intra-qubit exchange, including effects from counter rotating terms and off-axis rotations, as well as leakage errors during two-qubit operations. Residual inter-qubit exchange creates crosstalk errors that reduce single-qubit control fidelities. We show that using a single-spin coupler between two resonant singlet-triplet qubits can reduce this crosstalk error by an order of magnitude. Assuming perfect coupler state preparation and realistic charge and hyperfine noise, we predict that coupler-assisted two-qubit gate errors can be below $3\\times10^{-3}$ for gate times as short as $66~\\text{ns}$, even in the presence of residual exchange levels exceeding several hundred kHz.

This tutorial-style chapter focuses on the use of classical electromagnetic fields to steer the system dynamics. In this approach, the quantum nature of the control stems solely from the underlying dynamics, through the exploitation of destructive and constructive interference to reach the control target. We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional. All concepts are illustrated using recent work from my research group, with a focus on controlling atoms and superconducting qubits.

The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning.

Quantum transduction, which coherently converts between microwave and optical (M-O) photons, is a critical component of such an architecture. Current approaches are hindered by the unavoidable problem of device heating due to the optical pump. In this work, we propose a pump-free scheme based on color centers that generates time-bin encoded M-O Bell pairs. Our scheme first creates spin-photon entanglement and then converts the spin state into a time-bin-encoded microwave photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. In our protocol, the microwave retrieval is heralded by detecting the microwave signal with a three-level transmon. We have analyzed the resulting Bell state fidelity and generation probability of this protocol. Our simulation shows that by combining a state-of-the-art spin-optical interface with our proposed strongly-coupled spin-microwave design, the pump-free scheme can generate M-O Bell pairs at a heralding rate exceeding one kilohertz with near-unity fidelity, which establishes the scheme as a promising source for M-O Bell pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The decoy states are created by varying the optical excitation of the quantum emitter to modulate the photon number distribution. We provide an analysis of our scheme based on existing security proofs, allowing the calculation of secret key rates including finite key effects. This enables us to demonstrate, with a realistic single-photon source, positive secret key rates using our scheme over 227 km of optical fiber, equivalent to a loss tolerance one order of magnitude greater than non-decoy schemes. This work broadens the scope of single-photon sources in future quantum networks by enabling long-distance QKD with realistic levels of single-photon purity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Implementation of a decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme using a telecom C-band single-emitter source to achieve a loss tolerance one order of magnitude greater than non-decoy schemes with practical single-photon purity and long-distance QKD over 227 km fiber.", "motivation": "The motivation is to enhance the practicality and scalability of quantum key distribution by minimizing signal losses and extending operational distances, which is crucial for the development of quantum networks.", "method": "The method involves utilizing a telecom C-band single-emitter source to create decoy states by controlling the optical excitation of the quantum emitter to modulate the photon number distribution.
