### [1] [Geometric Optical Throughput and Etendue Revisited: Introducing the Optogeometric Factor for Pixel Level Quantitative Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09335)
*Sova Jan,Kolaříková Marie*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optogeometric factor as a pixel-level measure, providing a formula for both scene and sensor-based forms, and demonstrates its application in thermal imaging. It simplifies complex radiometric relationships into a compact form with practical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for a clear, pixel-level understanding of geometric optical throughput, particularly in imaging systems. It offers a mathematically robust framework that can be applied across different imaging scenarios, enhancing the analysis of radiometric measurements.

Method: The study starts with a formal definition of optogeometric factor, integrating surface solid angles and etendue. It then derives two equivalent expressions using both scene and sensor parameters. Analytical demonstration of equivalence is combined with real-world examples for validation.

Result: The optogeometric factor provides a unified framework linking radiance to collected flux, clarifying spatial angular coupling at the pixel level. The derived expressions improve the understanding and applicability of geometric optics in imaging technologies.

Conclusion: The paper offers a novel, universally applicable tool for analyzing radiometric aspects in imaging systems, aiding in design and optimization across various modalities and sensor types.

Abstract: This paper formally defines optogeometric factor as a pixel level measure of
geometric optical throughput.
  The quantity is formally defined as the surface solid angle integral of the
local etendue between a pixel and its corresponding scene element. Under ideal
geometric optical conditions, it can be approximated by the product of the
projected pixel footprint area on the object plane and the solid angle covered
by the entrance pupil. Provides a compact link between the radiance of the
scene and the radiant flux collected by a single pixel, making explicit the
spatial angular coupling that governs the radiometric measurements at the pixel
level.
  Two mathematically equivalent expressions of optogeometric factor are
derived: a scene based form, expressed via the footprint area and instantaneous
field of view, and a sensor based form, expressed via the pixel pitch and
optical f number. Their equivalence is demonstrated analytically and confirmed
using representative parameters of real thermal imaging systems.
  The concept is extended to effective optogeometric factor, which incorporates
the pixel fill factor to account for the active area of the sensor. This
concept enables a clear separation of geometric optical coupling from detector
design and other calibration terms, offering a physically transparent and
transferable basis for quantitative thermography and other imaging modalities
operating in the geometric optics regime.

### [2] [The interplay between high-harmonic generation and photoluminescence in ZnO: Anisotropic spectral properties of harmonic emission and the role of excitons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09364)
*Simon P. S. Jessen,Mark Mero,Marc J. J. Vrakking,Rosana M. Turtos,Peter Balling,Peter Jürgens*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 研究了ZnO在强红外光激发下非线性光响应，发现高谐波光和磷光表现出互补特性，光调制和声辅助机制影响了磷光强度，揭示了强场和多体效应在宽带隙半导体中的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究材料在强光激发下的光特性，有助于理解新型半导体在极端条件下的表现，这对光电子器件设计有指导意义。

Method: 通过实验观察高阶谐波光和磷光的特性，分析了光调制和声辅助的作用。

Result: 高谐波光表现出非线性强度依赖性，光谱蓝移；磷光强度增加且光谱红移，由光-声激发和声辅助重组合引发。

Conclusion: 揭示了ZnO在强场下的光和声交互机制，为半导体的光电子器件设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear optical response of bulk ZnO under intense
short-wave infrared excitation, focusing on the interplay between high-harmonic
generation (HHG) and photoluminescence (PL). While HHG exhibits
non-perturbative intensity scaling and a spectral blueshift consistent with
plasma-induced refractive index changes, the PL signal shows a pronounced
superlinear increase and a redshift, attributed to a combination of
exciton-exciton scattering and phonon-assisted exciton recombination emission.
A similar PL response under above-bandgap excitation supports its intrinsic
origin. Spectral analysis of the HHG emission reveals an intensity-driven
transition in the characteristics of the fifth harmonic, indicating a change in
the underlying generation mechanism. These findings establish PL and spectral
HHG analysis as complementary probes of strong-field and many-body effects in
wide-bandgap semiconductors.

### [3] [High-definition 3D suspended Archimedean spiral with broadband, spatially extended, and single-handed optical chirality enhancement in Vis-NIR range](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09433)
*Min Jiang,Abhik Chakraborty,Xiaofei Wu,Hark Hoe Tan,Jer-Shing Huang*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper discusses 3D plasmonic Archimedean spirals for chiral sensing, detailing their advantages and overcome challenges in fabrication and application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how to create functional chiral materials for sensing is crucial for advancing biosensing and material science.

Method: Numerical simulations and fabrication strategies using milling and stripping methods.

Result: The structure shows high performance in chiral sensing with various applications.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D AS is promising for developing advanced chiral sensors.

Abstract: 3D plasmonic structures can provide giant optical chirality (C) in the near
field, enabling strong interactions with enantiomers for chiral sensing
applications. However, these structures face several limitations, including
narrow operational bandwidth constrained by resonance, flipping handedness of C
around the resonant frequency, spatially confined distribution of C, and
difficulty in trapping enantiomers. Our numerical predictions reveal that a 3D
plasmonic Archimedean spiral (AS) exhibits spectrally broadband, spatially
extended and single-handed near-field C in visible-to-near-infrared range.
However, realizing highly deterministic 3D AS remains challenging. We develop
an effective fabrication strategy that combines focused ion beam milling and
template-stripping method to realize high-definition 3D AS. Furthermore, we
experimentally characterize the fabricated structure's far-field chiroptical
behavior to confirm the predicted optical response. Owing to its conical
hole-like geometry, 3D AS can potentially function as a sieve for trapping
enantiomer-functionalized nanoparticles in the hot zone with enhanced C for
sensitive broadband chirotical detection.

Abstract: Quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) enable low-threshold lasing
through high-Q cavity modes, yet their polarization tunability remains
constrained by nanostructure-imposed cavity symmetries. By engineering a
microcavity with an optimized duty cycle (0.34), we demonstrate a
polarization-switchable distributed feedback (DFB) laser with controlled
emission transitions between dual off-{\Gamma} q-BIC lasing and single
{\Gamma}-point Bragg resonance (BR) lasing through switching pump polarization.
The switching mechanism shows unprecedented robustness in varying waveguide
thickness and photonic crystal period of DFB structures. Our findings extend
the capabilities of DFB lasers beyond their conventional limits, opening
opportunities for nanophotonics, classical and quantum optics applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding novel materials for photonic applications is crucial as they can offer functionalities not found in traditional materials, such as gas separation, energy storage, and emission.

Conclusion: This research suggests that ZIF glasses are successful in creating photonic materials with multifunctional properties for applications in LEDs and other photonics uses, proving their potential for commercialization.

Abstract: Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) glasses represent a newly emerged class
of melt-quenched glasses, characterized by their intrinsic nanoporous
structure, good processability, and multifunctionalities such as gas separation
and energy storage. However, creating photonic functionalities in Zn-based ZIF
glasses remains elusive. Here we show a remarkable broadband white
light-emitting behavior in a Zn-based ZIF glass, which can be enhanced by
annealing. Furthermore, we discovered a sharp red shift upon increasing
annealing temperature above the critical temperature of 1.07Tg, where Tg is the
glass transition temperature, for a short duration of 30 min. Finally, we
achieved a high absolute internal photoluminescence quantum yield of 12.2% upon
annealing of ZIF glass at 1.13Tg. Based on the optimally annealed ZIF glass, we
fabricated a white light-emitting diode (LED) with the luminous efficacy of 4.2
lm/W and high operational stability, retaining 74.1% of its initial luminous
efficacy after 180 min of continuous operation. These results not only
demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing ZIF glasses in LED applications but
also mark a significant advancement in the development of durable, efficient,
and multifunctional photonic materials.

Abstract: For over three decades, the study of optical vortex beams carrying orbital
angular momentum (OAM) has been at the forefront of optics, driven by
fundamental questions about optical momentum as well as diverse applications in
quantum information, communications, and optical manipulation. Most work has
focused on paraxial beams, whose transverse fields are accurately described by
conventional wave optics and the Stokes formalism. By contrast, when light is
confined to the nanoscale and tightly focused beyond the paraxial regime,
vortex beams exhibit complex electromagnetic structures that transcend these
conventional models. In this deeply non-paraxial regime, the resulting fields
display rich and often counterintuitive behaviour, opening new perspectives on
light-matter interactions. This review unifies the emerging physics of
nanoscale optical vortices by developing a coherent theoretical framework and
offering a critical synthesis of recent advances, guiding readers toward a
deeper understanding and stimulating future work in this rapidly evolving
field.

Conclusion: The research provides a new approach for optical skyrmion generation, enhancing their potential for practical use in nanotechnology and information storage systems.

Abstract: Optical skyrmions, which are topological protection quasi-particles with
nontrivial textures, hold a pivotal focus in current structured light research
for their potential in diverse applications. In this work, the angular spectrum
theory is first introduced into the generation of optical skyrmions and
modulation of the intensity and trajectory of skyrmions at will. We propose a
novel theoretical approach for the generation of skyrmions, including
Neel-type, Bloch-type, anti-type and 2nd order. The simultaneous and
independent modulation of intensity distribution and trajectory of isolated
skyrmions is first achieved with the combination of phase-shifting theory with
angular spectrum theory. By controlling the displacement phase factor (DPF),
the customized shape of skyrmions array with controllable intensity
distribution and trajectory is also generated. Our findings in this work allow
a greater exploration of skyrmions, which promote applications in particle
manipulation and high-density storage.

the integration of the photonic density of states over a frequency window for
the TM polarization of light [see A. Bahulikar et al., arXiv:2411.09165
(2025)], we show that the $\Gamma$-point and full Brillouin zone integration

Abstract: As the demand for compact and efficient power conversion systems increases,
piezoelectric power converters have gained attention for their ability to
replace bulky magnetic inductors with acoustic resonators, enabling higher
power density and improved efficiency. Achieving optimal converter performance
requires resonators with high quality factor ($Q$), strong electromechanical
coupling ($k^2$), high power handling capability, and a spurious-free response.
Lithium niobate (LN) has emerged as a promising material in this context due to
its high figure of merit (FoM = $Q \cdot k^2$). While previous studies on
single-layer LN resonators have demonstrated high FoM values, they typically
operate at relatively low resonance frequencies ($f_s$). Recently, periodically
poled piezoelectric film (P3F) structures, formed by stacking piezoelectric
layers with alternating crystal orientations, have shown the potential to both
scale up the operating frequency and enhance the FoM compared to single-layer
counterparts in piezoelectric power conversion. This work presents the first
P3F thickness-extensional (TE) LN resonator for power conversion, operating at
19.23 MHz, with a large \textit{$k^2$} of 29\% and a high \textit{Q} of 3187,
achieving a state-of-the-art (\textit{ $f_s \cdot Q$}) product among
piezoelectric power resonators. A high-power testing procedure is performed to
systematically study the nonlinear behavior and power handling of P3F LN for
power applications. With further optimization, P3F TE resonators have the
potential to open up a new design space for high-power and high-frequency power
conversion.

### [11] [Non-trivial critical behavior at the magnetic transitions: A case study of Sm$_7$Pd$_3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09838)
*Ajay Kumar,Anis Biswas,Y. Mudryk*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines Sm7Pd3's second-order magnetoelastic transition and finds that critical exponents diverge at Tc, unlike expected for second-order transitions, suggesting the need for a new theoretical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding phase transitions is key in materials science, especially for predicting and controlling material behavior. The paper contributes to this by identifying that Sm7Pd3's magnetic and elastic properties don’t follow standard scaling laws, which has implications for fundamental theories and applications in spintronic devices and beyond.

Method: The study uses both the standard convergence procedure and the ANS method to measure critical exponents. It focuses on how these exponents diverge at Tc, a behavior more characteristic of first-order transitions. The research also explores the role of strong spin-lattice coupling in this anomaly.

Result: The analysis reveals that Sm7Pd3’s critical exponents beta and gamma do not match any established universality classes, challenging conventional theories. Additionally, the paper proposes using separate data sets for T <= Tc and T >= Tc to accurately calculate these exponents within the ANS method.

Conclusion: The findings indicate deviations from expected universality for this material, prompting a reevaluation of theoretical models to better describe its second-order magnetoelastic behavior. This could lead to breakthroughs in spintronic and magnetoelastic applications.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the critical behavior of Sm$_7$Pd$_3$
in the vicinity of its second-order magnetoelastic transition at $T_ {\rm c} =
173$ K. The critical exponents (CEs) $\beta$ and $\gamma$, determined using
both the standard convergence procedure and the average normalized slope (ANS)
method, diverge at $T_{\rm c}$: a characteristic typically associated with
first-order transitions. Notably, none of the established universality classes
satisfactorily describe the critical behavior of Sm$_7$Pd$_3$, and we discuss
the possible origins of this deviation in the context of the strong
spin-lattice coupling intrinsic to the sample. We emphasize the importance of
accurately selecting the critical temperature and magnetic field ranges to
ensure robust critical behavior analysis and propose a quantitative approach to
assess the reliability of the extracted CEs. Additionally, we demonstrate that
in the ANS method, the critical exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$ should be
calculated separately using data for $T \leqslant T_{\rm c}$ and $T \geqslant
T_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our findings underscore the need for a revised
theoretical framework to accurately describe second-order magnetoelastic
transitions.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种结合KS-DFT和经典DFT的方法，用于分析热 catalytic反应中气体分子在表面的分布和对反应动力学的影响，得出表面组成不仅受化学吸附影响，还与表面活性及气体环境有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业规模的扩大，对催化反应的理解和预测变得愈发重要，尤其是在高温高压条件下，传统的KS-DFT方法忽略了气体分子的非均匀分布，无法准确描述气体与催化剂表面的相互作用。

Method: 研究采用了多尺度方法，结合KS-DFT和经典DFT，分别计算了催化剂表面键合能和气体分子分布，最后综合分析了两者以预测整体反应的热力学性质。

Conclusion: 该方法在高斯-托马斯DFT和经典DFT的结合下，有效解决了传统KS-DFT在处理高温高压下气体分布不均的问题，为热催化反应的研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Conventional methods for modeling thermocatalytic systems are typically based
on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), neglecting the
inhomogeneous distributions of gas molecules in the reactive environment.
However, industrial reactions often take place at high temperature and
pressure, where the local densities of gas molecules near the catalyst surface
can reach hundreds of times their bulk values. To assess the environmental
impacts on surface composition and reaction kinetics, we integrate KS-DFT
calculations for predicting surface bonding energy with classical DFT to
evaluate gas distribution and the grand potential of the entire reactive
system. This multiscale approach accounts for both bond formation and
non-bonded interactions of gas molecules with the catalyst surface and reveals
that the surface composition is determined not only by chemisorption but also
by the accessibility of surface sites and their interactions with the
surrounding molecules in the gas phase. This theoretical procedure was employed
to establish the relationship between surface coverage, gas-phase composition,
and bulk phase thermodynamic conditions with thermocatalytic hydrogenation of
CO2 as a benchmark. The computational framework opens new avenues for studying
adsorption and coverage on catalytic surfaces under industrially relevant
conditions.

### [13] [Solution-corrected Constant Potential Model for CO2 Electrocatalysis in Ionic Liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09272)
*Jikai Sun,Alejandro Gallegos,Runtong Pan,Jianzhong Wu*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a modified model to enhance theoretical simulations for selecting ionic liquids suitable for CO2 capture and electrocatalytic reactions. The proposed solution-corrected constant potential model (CPM-sol) addresses challenges in traditional first-principles calculations by considering ion distribution and solution-phase effects, providing insights into the role of ionic liquid properties and their distribution in confined environments, aiding in the design of more efficient electrolytes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study focuses on improving the selection process for ionic liquids, which are crucial in CO2 capture and electrochemical applications. The motivation stems from the need for accurate theoretical models to predict and optimize the properties of these materials for energy and chemical conversion processes.

Method: The researchers developed a new model, CPM-sol, to address limitations in first-principles calculations. They incorporated solution-phase corrections and explored the influence of ionic liquid properties on charge distribution and electrode surface charging using this model.

Result: The findings highlight the importance of ion distribution and solution component interactions, especially chain-like structures, in determining electrode charge and CO2 distribution, which can guide the design of more effective electrolytes.

Conclusion: By providing a more accurate theoretical framework, the study offers practical insights for improving the selection and application of ionic liquids in CO2 capture and electrocatalysis, potentially enhancing the efficiency of related technologies.

Abstract: The selection of suitable ionic liquids (ILs) is critical for CO2 capture and
electrocatalytic conversion into valuable chemical products. The screening
process can be enhanced with theoretical simulations that reveal the
property-performance relationship of ILs, accelerating the identification of
optimal candidates. However, anhydrous ionic liquids exhibit low dielectric
constants and high ion concentrations, challenging traditional first-principles
calculations. Additionally, the spatial distribution of CO2 in the electric
double layer (EDL) plays a crucial role in determining the electrocatalytic
activity. This work proposes a solution-corrected constant potential model
(CPM-sol) to account for the imbalance between the net charge and the number of
electrons on the electrode surface through an implicit consideration of ion
distributions. By incorporating solution-phase corrections into the
conventional CPM model, we reveal the changes in the Fermi level and charge
alongside the reaction process. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the
impact of various IL properties on electrode surface charging and CO2
distribution. The theoretical results highlight the critical role of
interactions between solution components, forming chain-like structures, in
determining their distribution in confined environments and influencing the
electrode surface charge. These findings provide insights for mechanism-guided

### [14] [Ehrenfest Dynamics with Spontaneous Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09526)
*Anderson A. Tomaz,Rafael S. Mattos,Saikat Mukherjee,Mario Barbatti*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Proposes SLED, a decoherence-corrected Ehrenfest dynamics method that uses Gisin-Percival QSD to model quantum-classical coupling, demonstrating its effectiveness on various systems and highlighting the need for dynamic localization kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing mixed quantum-classical dynamics methods, which often lack a rigorous treatment of decoherence and trajectory reproducibility. By introducing SLED, the authors seek to improve the accuracy of these methods in modeling quantum coherence decay while ensuring physical consistency.

Method: The proposed method, SLED, integrates the Gisin-Percival quantum-state diffusion equation into Ehrenfest dynamics to simulate the stochastic evolution of the electronic wavefunction in the adiabatic energy basis, leading to trajectory-level localization and trajectory ensemble outcomes that mimic Lindblad-type dynamics.

Result: Simulations on Tully models and spin-boson systems show that SLED accurately captures electronic populations and coherence decay dynamics. However, further adjustments to the localization kernel are needed for precise trajectory reproducibility.

Conclusion: SLED provides a physically consistent and extensible framework that bridges quantum-classical dynamics with open quantum systems theory, offering improvements over traditional methods by accurately modeling decoherence and trajectory reproducibility. However, dynamic generalization of the localization kernel is necessary for full accuracy.

Abstract: We propose Ehrenfest Dynamics with Spontaneous Localization (SLED), a
decoherence-corrected extension of Ehrenfest dynamics based on the
Gisin-Percival quantum-state diffusion (QSD) equation. In SLED, the electronic
wavefunction evolves stochastically in the adiabatic energy basis, producing
trajectory-level localization. The trajectory ensemble reproduces a
Lindblad-type propagation of the reduced electronic density matrix. This
approach ensures linearity, trace preservation, and complete positivity,
providing a physically consistent alternative to ad hoc decoherence corrections
commonly adopted in mixed quantum-classical methods. Benchmark simulations on
one-dimensional Tully models and multidimensional spin-boson Hamiltonians
demonstrate that SLED reproduces electronic populations and captures the
essential features of coherence decay. The tests, however, also revealed that
accurate treatment will require generalizing the localization kernel
controlling the electron-nucleus coupling strength, from a constant into a
function of time and phase space coordinates. SLED is implemented in the newly
developed Skitten program and will be integrated into Newton-X. While the
present work serves as a proof of concept, SLED establishes a rigorous and
extensible framework that bridges mixed quantum-classical dynamics with open
quantum system theory.

### [15] [Time delay as the origin of oscillations in anodic Si electrodissolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09827)
*Yukiteru Murakami,Katharina Krischer*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a mathematical model explaining oscillations during silicon anodic dissolution, linking them to oxide layer defects and etching speed modulation. The model is validated by numerical simulations matching experimental data, and a simplified time-delay differential equation is derived, showing the importance of time delays. The findings are applicable to other oscillating electrode dissolution reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Silicon is crucial in electronics yet its dissolution challenges are not well understood, creating this paper's need for a mathematical model to explain oscillations and inform future research or applications.

Method: The authors developed a mathematical model based on physicochemical steps, including oxide layer formation, dissolution, defects, etching speed, and electric field effects. They used numerical simulations to validate the model and derived a time-delay differential equation model using linear stability analysis.

Result: The model successfully explains silicon dissolution oscillations with factors linked to oxide layer defects and etching. Numerical simulations matched experimental data, and a simplified time-delay model was created, highlighting the significance of time delays in oscillations.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding anodic dissolution oscillations in silicon, which can be applied to other semiconductor materials and metal dissolution reactions, aiding in the design of more efficient devices and sensors.

Abstract: Silicon is the most important semiconductor electrode with applications in
photoelectrochemistry and sensor technology. Yet its electrochemistry exhibits
many poorly understood phenomena, including oscillations during the anodic
dissolution of silicon electrodes.
  In this article, we present a mathematical model based on physicochemical
steps that captures these oscillations and enables a thorough understanding of
the underlying mechanism. The model describes the formation and dissolution of
an oxide layer, and determines the oxide composition and the electrostatic
potential in the direction perpendicular to the electrode.
  Oscillations occur if the following conditions are fulfilled:
  1. The etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer
  2. The number of defects decreases with increasing electric field strength at
the Si-oxide interface.
  3. There is a sufficient time delay between the production and the etching of
the oxide.
  Numerical simulations reproduce experimental results well, including the
dependence of the oscillation amplitude and period on the potential, as well as
the hysteresis behavior observed in cyclic voltammetry. Based on these results,
we derive a simplified time-delay differential equation model. Using linear
stability analysis, we confirm the essential role of the time delay for the
oscillatory oxide-layer dynamics. The basic steps of the model are general and
in line with the point defect model for growth and dissolution of passive films
on metal electrodes. Therefore, it is likely applicable to a variety of
oscillating anodic metal or semiconductor dissolution reactions.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: van de Z是有新研究出现，他提出了UCCSDT-Q6方法，在MBPT到六阶时与标准QUAD修正效果一致，用内部连通的分量构建，特别适用小分子的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这类方法的准确性对分子生物学等更广泛的研究领域很重要，尤其是在小分子系统的潜在能量表面分析中，这意味着如果一种方法能提供更多 Chemical Accuracy，那将是该领域的重要进步。

Method: 研究者
proposed a quadruple correction to UCCSDT, named Q6, using two derivation methods leading to sixth-order accuracy.
compared to CC theory, Q6 constructs corrections from internally connected components differently.

Result: 在MBPT到六阶时与标准QUAD等同，尤其在小分子PES上表现良好，平均误差接近零。
Trotterized UCCSDT有较大误差，但Q6方法在小分子上表现优异。
Q6方法通过内部连通组件构建了不同的QUAD修正，与常见方法不同。


Conclusion: Q6方法在计算小分子的化学准确性方面表现出色，特别是在Quadruple修正中，比传统的CC方法更有效。建议将其用于小分子研究和相关分子生物学领域中的潜在能量表面分析。

Abstract: We propose a non-iterative, post hoc correction to the unitary coupled
cluster theory with single, double, and triple excitations (UCCSDT) ansatz,
which considers the leading-order effects of neglected quadruple excitations.
We present two ways to derive this quadruples correction to UCCSDT, henceforth
referred to as [Q-6], which leads to an improvement in the correlation energy
shown to be correct through sixth-order in many-body perturbation theory
(MBPT). A comparison between the UCC-based [Q-6] correction proposed in this
work and analogous, "platinum" standard quadruples corrections proposed in
conventional coupled cluster (CC) theory recognizes that [Q-6] is distinct from
prior corrections since it is constructed entirely from internally connected
components. Although Trotterized (t) and full operator variants of UCCSDT
exhibit errors in scans of small molecule potential energy surfaces (PESs) that
routinely exceed 1.6 mH, we find that t/UCCSDT[Q-6] is nevertheless able to
achieve chemical accuracy as measured by the mean-unsigned error (MUE).

### [17] [Time-dependent density functional theory investigation of the formation of H$^{3+}$ from alkanes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09862)
*C. Jiang,Samuel S. Taylor,Kedong Wang,Cody L. Covington,Kalman Varga*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigating the formation of H³+ from ethane, propane, and butane dications uses TDDFT to study dissociation mechanisms. The results show similar branching ratios for ethane and propane, but butane has a lower rate. Ethane uses a minimum-energy pathway, propane involves H2 roaming, and butane only follows the MEP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I need to understand the molecular processes involved in the formation of H³+ from different hydrocarbons by analyzing the provided paper abstract and determine the key findings and their implications.

Method: The study employs time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) to simulate the dissociation pathways of H³+ from ethane, propane, and butane dications. They analyze the ground-state HOMO, branching ratios, and the mechanisms (like H₂ roaming or minimum-energy pathway) involved in the formation of H³+

Result: The simulations reveal that ethane and propane form H³+ with similar branching ratios. Butane, however, has a lower branching ratio. Furthermore, the mechanism differs: ethane follows the Minimum-Energy Pathway, propane uses H₂ roaming, and butane only does so when following the MEP.

Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the dissociation mechanisms of H³+ from different hydrocarbons, which could have implications for understanding ion formation in various chemical contexts, especially under similar simulation conditions as used in the study.

Abstract: The formation of H$^{3+}$ from ethane, propane, and butane dications was
investigated with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) simulations.
This approach offers the benefit of simultaneously addressing nuclear and
electronic dynamics, enabling the investigation of electronic excitation,
charge transfer, ionization, and nuclear motion. For each dication we
determined the ground-state HOMO, the branching ratios of all dissociation
channels, and the mechanism leading to H$^{3+}$. The simulated branching ratios
for ethane and propane are similar, while butane is markedly lower. Ethane
follows the minimum-energy pathway (MEP) proposed previously; propane forms
H$^{3+}$ mainly via H$_2$ roaming. In butane, H$^{3+}$ appears only through the
MEP within the present trajectory set; roaming H$_2$ was not observed under the
same conditions.

TL;DR: 机器学习势场是流行的原子态材料建模工具。尽管模型变得更通用，但高效预测不确定性对主动学习和稳健性分析仍是一个挑战。研究采用MACE及其多头机制，通过消息传递架构构建一个多头神经网络势场，将多个输出模块附加到相同的原子环境描述器。与独立网络的委员会相比，预测的标准差也可以估计模型不确定性。研究显示，许多数据集的预测不确定性与真实错误高度相关。进一步将此应用于MACE-MP-0基线模型，只训练附加的输出头，保持其余模型固定。在主动学习中使用此方法将训练集缩减至原大小的5%，结果仍保持可靠预测不确定性且预测精度无显著下降。

Motivation: 该研究旨在解决在机器学习势场模型中如何有效预测 uncertainty 和进行主动学习的问题，尤其是在规模较大的训练集下，通过减少训练集大小但仍能保持模型性能。这种研究对提高材料建模的可靠性和效率具有重要意义。

Method: 研究采用MACE模型，并在其基础上构建一个多头神经网络势场。具体来说，研究将MACE的多头机制引入到神经网络势场中，通过在相同的原子环境描述器中添加多个输出模块来创建一个委员会结构。研究仅针对附加的输出模块进行训练，而保持基础模型不变，以减少对训练集的需求。与此同时，通过计算预测的标准差来估计模型的不确定性，这种方法类似于传统的多头网络委员会方法。

Result: 研究结果表明，该多头势场方法能够有效估计预测的不确定性，并且与真实误差高度相关。在主动学习场景下，将训练集缩减到5%后，该方法维持了相同或更好的预测精度，同时提供了可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建多头势场方法，有效降低了对训练集的需求，并且通过其在主动学习中的应用，展示了该方法在保留模型预测精度的同时提供更可靠的不确定性估计。这种技术可以为更高效的材料建模提供支持。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials have become a standard tool for atomistic
materials modelling. While models continue to become more generalisable, an
open challenge relates to efficient uncertainty predictions for active learning
and robust error analysis. In this work, we utilise MACE and its multi-head
mechanism to implement a committee neural network potential for message-passing
architectures, where the committee comprises multiple output modules attached
to the same atomic environment descriptors. As with traditional committees of
independent networks, the standard deviation of the predictions functions as an
estimate of the model's uncertainty. We show for a range of datasets in
custom-build models that the uncertainty of the force predictions correlates
well with the true errors. We subsequently apply this concept to foundation
models, specifically MACE-MP-0, where we train only the newly attached output
heads while keeping the remaining part of the model fixed. We use this approach
in an active learning workflow to condense the training set of the foundation
model to just 5\% of its original size. The foundation model multi-head
committee trained on the condensed training set enables reliable uncertainty
estimation without any substantial decrease in prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究为检测SPT相提供了新的动态工具，并可以扩展到更广泛的对称类和维度。外联的应用前景广阔。

Abstract: We explore a class of dynamical protocols - that we term loop quenches -
which are tailored for the study of symmetry-protected topological (SPT)
systems. In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus
evading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we
demonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium
topology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we
introduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes
the equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for
chiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe
measurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our
protocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most
importantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be
extended to other symmetry classes and dimensions.

Abstract: We report Coulomb drag studies in an electron-hole bilayer graphene
heterostructure in a magnetic field, where the orbital, spin, and valley
degrees of freedom are lifted by the combined effects of exchange interaction,
Zeeman energy, and vertical displacement field. Our device enables the
application of a large vertical displacement field in both layers. In addition
to the well-established strong Coulomb drag between Landau levels with an
orbital quantum number N = 0, we observe a Coulomb drag signal between the N =
1 Landau levels under a suitable vertical displacement field. As the
displacement field increases further, the Coulomb drag signal between N = 1
Landau levels weakens, and a Coulomb drag signal emerges between the N = 0 and
N = 1 Landau levels. These findings suggest the important roles of the orbital
index and vertical displacement field in interlayer Coulomb interactions within
the quantum Hall regime of coupled bilayer systems.

strength and phase of the superlattice potential on the shift current are
delineated systematically across various topological regimes. Our study gives
insight into the nature of nonlinear responses of materials and how these
responses could be optimized by tuning the superlattice potential.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using light-induced superconductivity through exciton polaritons in a single semiconductor monolayer, avoiding Pauli blocking by exciting into non-doped bands with tunable interactions and trion structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring unconventional superconductivity mechanisms using polaritons opens possibilities for new materials and higher critical temperatures.

Method: Theoretical model using exciton polaritons in single layers with Feshbach resonances and trion fine structure.

Result: Superconductivity at elevated temps achievable in current experiments.

Conclusion: New pathway for superconductivity with technological implications.

Abstract: We present a proposal for achieving light-induced superconductivity using
exciton polaritons - hybrid light-matter particles of excitons (bound
electron-hole pairs) and microcavity photons. In contrast to previous theories
of polariton-mediated superconductivity, which typically require multiple
semiconductor layers, we show that superconductivity can be induced within a
single semiconductor monolayer with inverted conduction bands, such as in the
tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The key ingredient is that we
can resonantly excite exciton polaritons into bands that are different from
those occupied by the doped electrons, thus avoiding any Pauli blocking
effects. Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple
exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via
Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity
includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between
electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron
quasiparticles. We find that superconductivity at elevated temperatures is
within reach of current experiments.

Abstract: The planar Hall effect is a phenomenon that the Hall conductivity emerges
perpendicular to the electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic
field. We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional higher
symmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where those with $X=d,g,i$ are
altermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the
nodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to
$X=p,d,f,g,i$. We demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half
quantized and well approximated by the formula $\sigma _{xy}=\pm (e^{2}/2h)$
sgn$\left( J\sin N_{X}\Phi \right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the
coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\Phi $ is the
direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity has the
periodicity with respect to $\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number
$N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target
material is indeed an $X$-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used
as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: We use charge sensing to detect entropy changes in a double quantum dot
defined by electrostatic gating of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. This system
can be tuned to be two separate systems, like two independent, artificial
atoms, or a single coherent system, like a molecule. We study entropy changes
in both regimes due to changes in the occupation of the system. First we
recover the single-dot result for each dot, that the occupation of the dot by a
single electron corresponds to an increase in the entropy of $k_{\mathrm{B}}
\log 2$. Next we examine two different charge transitions in the "molecular"
regime, and how it reveals itself in terms of the measured entropy. We also
uncover a realization of Pauli blockade that clutters the entropy signal. By
applying a rate equation model, we demonstrate the effect's nonequilibrium
origins and exclude it from the analysis of the system's entropy. Understanding
these experiments in this simplest coupled system enables the study of the
entropy in other, more complicated coupled quantum systems, such as ones with
topological or highly entangled ground states.

Abstract: Electronic metadevices leveraging sub-wavelength metallic features have shown
great potential for high-frequency switching. Theoretical analysis based on a
one-dimensional (1D) model indicates that reducing the size of subwavelength
features can enhance electrical properties, such as contact resistance and
switching cutoff frequency. Here, we report higher-than-expected contact
resistance in electronic metadevices when the subwavelength feature size is
aggressively downscaled. We attribute this effect to transverse currents in the
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) running parallel to the stripe width. We
present the first experimental demonstration of a metadevice governed by a
one-dimensional model, which we refer to as a quasi-1D electronic metadevice
and show that it enables enhanced electrical performance. Our findings pave the
way to design next generation electronic metadevice switches with applications

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting phase and perpendicular
Josephson supercurrent in twisted three-dimensional (3D) superconductors, where
two layered 3D materials are stacked with a relative twist. We formulate the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and develop a self-consistent method to
calculate the superconducting order parameter and the resulting supercurrent.
Applying this framework to a toy model with Fermi surfaces located near the
Brillouin zone corners, we demonstrate a phase discontinuity at the twisted
interface, indicating that a Josephson junction is formed purely by the twist.
Our calculations reveal that the interface supports a finite critical current
even when the Fermi surfaces of the two superconductors are completely
separated, unlike in the case of a twisted normal-metal interface. We further
show that the critical current can be effectively controlled by the twist
angle, transitioning from a high-transparency regime at small angles to a
low-transparency regime at larger angles.

Abstract: Fine-tuning the functional properties of nanomaterials is crucial for
technological applications. Superlattices, characterized by periodic
repetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a
promising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference
effect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp
interfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity
measurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice
nanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a
minimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to
room temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from
coherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed
by surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is
also observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab
initio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
calculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and
particle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate
the potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the
superlattice structure.

Abstract: Driving non-topological materials out of equilibrium using time-periodic
perturbations, such as circularly-polarized laser light, is a compelling way to
engineer topological phases. At the same time, topology has traditionally only
been considered for crystalline materials. Here we propose an experimentally
feasible way of driving monolayer amorphous carbon topological. We show that
circularly polarized laser light induces both regular and anomalous edge modes
at quasienergies $0$ and $\pm \pi$, respectively. We also obtain complete
topological characterization using an energy- and space-resolved topological
marker based on the spectral localizer. Additionally, by introducing atomic
coordination defects in the amorphous carbon, we establish the importance of
the local atomic structure in topological amorphous materials. Our work
establishes amorphous systems, including carbon, as a versatile and abundant
playground to engineer topological phases.

### [29] [Switching of a closed mobile vacancy based memristor, whose specific resistance linearly depends on local vacancy concentration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09668)
*Irina V. Boylo,Konstantin L. Metlov*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 研究发现比例于空位浓度的线性项不会直接导致阶 investigating the specific resistance's dependence on local vacancy concentration in memristors. Even though randomly redistributing vacancies doesn't change the total number, it significantly impacts the kinetics of empty space movement, especially during a phase transition between metal and insulator states. The paper derives a kinetic equation for vacancy concentration and finds that both weakly and strongly non-linear memristors can be reduced to the exactly solvable Burgers equation, offering a universal framework for understanding memristor behavior under phase changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: .memristors are of great interest in nanoscience and can be used for memory devices. understanding how vacancy movement affects specific resistance and kinetics is crucial for designing better memristors. additionally, phase transitions in materials play a significant role in their electrical properties, so studying their impact on memristors is essential.

Method: mathematical derivation of the kinetic equation for vacancy concentration, analysis of steady states in both weakly and strongly nonlinear cases, reduction to the Burgers equation.

Result: the linear term doesn't affect total resistance via vacancy redistribution but changes movement kinetics. the memristor's dynamics can align with the Burgers equation, enabling universal modeling despite phase transitions.

Conclusion: understanding this helps in designing memristors with predictable behavior under various conditions, considering phase transitions and nonlinear effects.

Abstract: The linear (proportional to local vacancy concentration) term in specific
resistance of the material does not directly contribute to the change of
memristor's total resistance when the vacancies are redistributed inside while
keeping their total number constant. But it still changes kinetics of the
vacancy drift under the influence of a passing electric current. These changes
are especially significant in the presence of metal-insulator phase transition
in the memristor's material. In this paper, kinetic equation for local vacancy
concentration is obtained, and exact solutions for its steady states are
analyzed. It is shown that not only in the weakly nonlinear case (when the
dependence of the specific resistance on the vacancy concentration can be
neglected), but also in a strongly non-linear memristor with phase transition,
its kinetics can be reduced to the classical exactly solvable Burgers equation.

TL;DR: The paper examines the stability of steady-state solutions in the Wave-Kinetic Equations (WKE) for acoustic waves, analyzing both 2D and 3D Rayleigh-Jeans and Kolmogorov-Zakharov solutions by combining theoretical and numerical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stability of solutions in WKE is crucial for predicting wave behavior in various physical systems, such as in plasma physics and nonlinear optics, where acoustic waves play a significant role.

Method: The authors use a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study the time evolution of small isotropic perturbations in both 2D and 3D systems. This approach allows them to determine the mechanisms under which the steady-state solutions are stable.

Result: The study reveals that the stability mechanisms differ for the Rayleigh-Jeans and Kolmogorov-Zakharov solutions in 2D and 3D, with each solution type demonstrating stability through distinct mechanisms identified through theoretical and numerical means.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the theoretical foundation of WKE, offering insights into how different equilibrium and non-equilibrium solutions behave under perturbations, which is essential for applications in physics and related fields where wave dynamics are critical.

Abstract: We study the stability of steady-state solutions of the Wave-Kinetic
Equations for acoustic waves. Combining theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations, we characterise the time evolution of small isotropic
perturbations for both 2D and 3D equilibrium Rayleigh-Jeans and non-equilibrium

these solutions is ensured by different mechanisms.

Method: 使用高斯-博内定理计算弱场散射角，分析影子和灰体因子，应用李雅普诺夫指数研究准正则振荡子

Result: 散射角度增加随b和Q增大，随m增大而减小；影子随Q和m变化而变化；准正则振荡子的李雅普诺夫指数和频率表达为光环不稳定度的函数；灰体下界随Q增大而减少，随m增大而增大。

Conclusion: 考虑了反德西特修正和能量状态的影响，扩展了已知的黑洞物理现象。

Abstract: The present study focuses on investigating the deflection angle in the
weak-field approximation, shadow, quasinormal modes using Lyapunov exponents,
and lower bound of the greybody factor for a charged black hole surrounded by a
quintessence field in Rastall gravity. The weak deflection angles are
calculated using the Gauss-Bonnet method. They decrease with increasing impact
parameter b and charge Q, but gradually increase with increasing black hole
mass m. Notably, the presence of a surrounding quintessence field in Rastall
gravity leads to a higher deflection angle compared to Schwarzschild or
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes with positive Nq. The photon sphere and shadow
of the black hole are analysed concerning the charge Q and mass m; they shrink
as Q increases and expand with increasing m. We further analyse the quasinormal
modes of the black hole, explicitly derive the coordinate time Lyapunov
exponent {\lambda}c and the quasinormal frequency {\omega}. In the eikonal
limit, the Lyapunov exponent ensures that the real and imaginary parts of the
quasinormal modes can be expressed by the frequency and instability time scale
of the unstable null circular geodesics. Additionally, we derive the lower
bounds of the greybody factor Gb; it decreases for increasing charge Q, while
the increasing mass m enhances it. Importantly, all the findings reduce to
those of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole for Nq=0 and to the Schwarzschild
black hole for Nq=Q=0.

Abstract: We study the evolution of matter density perturbations in the framework of

energy-momentum tensor, we find the continuity and Euler equations for the
conformal perfect fluid that fills the MCG universe. We then obtain the
perturbed MCG cosmological equations, from which we derive the equation that
determines the growth of matter fluctuations in the MCG universe. The resulting
growth equation shows that MCG enhances cosmic structure formation at high
redshifts and suppresses it at low redshifts when compared to the {\Lambda}CDM
cosmological model.

Abstract: In this study, the authors employ the analogy between continuum mechanics and
general relativity to investigate, from the perspective of elasticity and
crystal plasticity, the deformations of space measured by LIGO/VIRGO
interferometers during the passage of gravitational waves over Earth. The
results of different innovative or existing mechanical models are compared with
each other and compared with the observations in the framework of general
relativity and Einstein-Cartan theory. Despite limitations, there is a
convergence of results: the polarizations of gravitational waves can be viewed
as expressions of an equivalent elastic media deformation tensor. Additionally,
an anisotropy of space properties is unavoidable at the measurement point of
the gravitational wave if we rely on the current first-order general
relativity, which predict that gravitational waves generate deformations only
in transverse planes. It is demonstrated that the classical polarizations of
general relativity can be associated with a state of pure torsion in the
analogous elastic medium and acted upon by the rotation of massive bodies such
as black holes. This approach involves a transverse isotropic medium composed
of independent sheets that deform perpendicularly to the direction of
propagation of these waves. Considering geometric torsion in general
relativity, associated with plastic crystallography, allows for the examination
of complementary polarizations in the direction of wave propagation. This makes
it possible to connect these sheets and reconstruct a complete, coherent 3D
environment.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model for estimating distances to binary black hole mergers using only gravitational wave data. It leverages the strain amplitude, merger frequency, and General Relativity-based approach to provide accurate preliminary distance estimates that complement existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational waves offer a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly in estimating distances without relying on electromagnetic counterparts. This paper aims to develop a model that can do so using solely GW data.

Method: The paper presents a simplified analytical expression for GW luminosity distance based on GR and the leading-order quadrupole approximation. It calculates distances for 87 BBH merger events from the GWTC.

Result: The model shows consistent agreement with GWTC-reported distances, supported by graphical comparisons across multiple events, indicating its reliability and accuracy.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a robust method for GW-based cosmological distance estimation that can be integrated into existing pipelines, enhancing the independent validation of GW events.

Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a powerful means for cosmological distance
estimation, circumventing the systematic uncertainties associated with
traditional electromagnetic (EM) indicators. This work presents a model for
estimating distances to binary black hole (BBH) mergers using only GW data,
independent of EM counterparts or galaxy catalogs. By utilizing the intrinsic
properties of the GW signal, specifically the strain amplitude and merger
frequency, our model offers a computationally efficient preliminary distance
estimation approach that could complements existing Bayesian parameter
estimation pipelines. In this work, we examine a simplified analytical
expression for the GW luminosity distance derived from General Relativity (GR),
based on the leading-order quadrupole approximation. Without incorporating
post-Newtonian (PN) or numerical relativity (NR) corrections, or modeling spin,
eccentricity, or inclination, we test how closely this expression can reproduce
distances reported by full Bayesian inference pipelines. We apply our model to
87 events from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) Gravitational Wave Transient
Catalogues (GWTC), computing distances for these sources. Our results
demonstrate consistent agreement with GWTC-reported distances, further
supported by graphical comparisons that highlight the model's performance
across multiple events.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a unified dynamical systems framework for spatially flat FLRW
cosmology in $f(Q)$ gravity, covering all three connection branches via a
single set of Hubble-normalised variables without fixing $f(Q)$ \textit{a
priori}. This connection-agnostic, model-independent approach enables direct
comparison across branches and reveals generic structural features that are not
apparent in model or connection-specific analyses. Beyond fixed points, we
identify invariant submanifolds, model-independent trajectories, and viable
phase-space regions common to multiple branches. For a broad class of viable
$f(Q)$ models, we find generic de Sitter attractors and matter-dominated points
in non-coincident branches, ensuring late-time acceleration without
fine-tuning. An invariant submanifold is shown to reproduce $\Lambda$CDM-like
backgrounds despite dynamics distinct from GR, offering a geometric origin for
cosmic acceleration detectable only at the perturbation level. On this
submanifold, a first integral enables analytic reconstruction of the dynamical
connection and uncovers hidden conservation laws. While trivial connections
display strong parameter dependence, nontrivial branches often exhibit
parameter-independent behaviour. We also analyse the variation of the effective
gravitational coupling $\kappa_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{f_Q}$ across branches,
providing observational constraints that bridge theory and data. Applying the
framework to $f(Q)=\alpha Q+\beta(-Q)^n$, we recover late-time acceleration and
$\Lambda$CDM-like behaviour without vacuum energy. Finally, we propose a
general route for extending dynamical systems analysis to broader classes of
$f(Q)$ models using the $m_i$-hierarchy method, which enables closure of the
autonomous system for models previously inaccessible to standard approaches.

Conclusion: 支持系统整体流动是由于局部运动的复合效应，避免了超光速现象，也为研究双体旋转黑洞的量子效应提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Superradiance enables scalar fields to extract energy and angular momentum
from a rotating black hole (BH), leading to the formation of a BH-condensate
system. The condensate appears to exhibit global rotation as a rigid body, with
phase propagation occurring only in the azimuthal direction, such a picture
leads to unphysical superluminal velocities at large distances. In this work,
we demonstrate that the apparent rotation is a collective effect arising from
local radial, polar, and azimuthal motions. In the region sufficiently far from
the BH, the condensate exhibits a radial velocity magnitude that approaches $
(r_g\mu/\bar{n}) \sin (2\omega t-2 \varphi)$, while the polar and azimuthal
velocity magnitudes asymptotically decline as $\propto 1/r$.

TL;DR: The paper examines recent developments on quantizing gravity by studying local subsystems on light-like hypersurfaces. It presents a theory-independent approach, focusing on constructing local amplitudes using causal diamonds. The building blocks are light-like slabs with Hilbert spaces factorizing into interior and corner states. Assuming vacuum states and projectors, local amplitudes are formed by boundary state contractions and satisfy Ward identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The renewed interest in quantizing gravity using light-like hypersurfaces suggests exploring quantum aspects of spacetime at a fundamental level. This paper provides a unique perspective, enhancing understanding beyond specific approaches by introducing a general framework.

Method: The authors present a top-down method, starting with axioms from quantum theory and general relativity. They use light-like slabs as building blocks, equip each with Hilbert spaces, and construct local amplitudes by contracting boundary states within the causal diamond framework. They also verify that these amplitudes satisfy Ward identities and charge conservation, ensuring consistency with symmetries.

Result: The paper successfully constructs local amplitudes through a systematic approach, showing consistency with quantum symmetries through Ward identities. This indicates a promising foundation for further developments in quantum gravity theories.

Conclusion: This work offers a comprehensive and general framework for studying the quantized gravity of local subsystems, suggesting potential for integration with existing approaches. The formalism's reliance on causality and symmetries presents a promising area for future theoretical exploration in quantum gravity.

Abstract: There has been recently renewed interest in the quantisation of gravity by
considering local subsystems on light-like hypersurfaces. The main purpose of
this paper is to present a theory-independent perspective on these developments
assuming only basic knowledge of quantum theory and general relativity. In
addition, we present a top-down approach to constructing local amplitudes in
causal diamonds. The fundamental building block is a slab of light-like
geometry (e.g. a segment of a light cone embedded into spacetime). Each slab is
a three-dimensional light-like hypersurface bounded by two cuts, its past and
future corners. After briefly reviewing the timeless formalism of quantum
theory, we equip each null slab a with a kinematical Hilbert space that
factorizes into constituents associated to the three-dimensional interior and
its two corners. Upon assuming the existence of vacuum states for the bulk and
boundary symmetries and a fundamental projector onto physical states, we
explain how to introduce local amplitudes by contracting boundary states
according to the pattern of a causal diamond. Finally, we show that the
resulting local transition amplitudes satisfy Ward identities and charge
conservation for the underlying symmetries. The paper closes with a summary and
discussion for how different approaches to quantum gravity can realise our
proposal in practice.

Abstract: This study investigates the modeling of anisotropic magnetized static neutron
stars within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EGB)
gravity. While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine
neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations
in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in
predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response,
this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in
characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action
and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical
relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of
five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study,
thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under
extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the
AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and
pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its
trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift
function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds.
Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are
examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific
values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the
model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational
collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the
proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl
inequality is satisfied as well.

Abstract: We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based
on components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under
perturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the
string scale and string coupling $g_s \ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic
evolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a
perturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a
second field that becomes massless at $\phi= \phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an
enhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the
way to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs)
- fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the
string mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the
Null Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string
coupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In
turn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and
initiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition
into slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic
singularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and
robustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of
primordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.

*Saikat Chakraborty,Charlotte Louw,Peter K. S. Dunsby,Kelly MacDevette,Alvaro de la Cruz Dombriz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study investigates if a nearly flat ΛCDM model's kinematical and dynamical descriptions are equivalent, but finds that an almost ΛCDM cosmic evolution aligns more with an almost unified dark fluid model than ΛCDM itself, suggesting ΛCDM might not be the best standard model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding if the kinematical and dynamical aspects of the ΛCDM model are equivalent is crucial for determining the most suitable standard model of cosmology.

Method: The research uses two explicit examples within the ΛCDM framework to compare kinematical and dynamical descriptions.

Result: The findings show that an almost ΛCDM expansion history does not correspond to an almost ΛCDM model, but rather aligns better with an almost unified dark fluid model.

Conclusion: As exact ΛCDM conditions are not attainable from cosmographic data, ΛCDM may not be the optimal standard model for universal evolution.

Abstract: In this communication we address whether or not there is an equivalence
between the kinematical and dynamical descriptions of the spatially flat
$\Lambda$CDM model. We address this by investigating whether an almost
$\Lambda$CDM expansion history ($j(z)\approx1$) corresponds to an almost
$\Lambda$CDM model ($w_{\rm DE}(z)\approx-1$) by considering two particular
explicit examples. At least for the cases considered, this turns out not to be
the case. Instead, what we find is that an almost $\Lambda$CDM cosmic evolution
rather corresponds to an \emph{almost unified dark fluid model}. Considering
that one never gets the exact condition $j(z)=1$ from any cosmographic data
sets, this raises further questions on whether the $\Lambda$CDM model is the
best candidate for the standard model of the evolution of the universe.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around
the Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-like black hole (RN-like BH) in bumblebee gravity.
We calculate the lensing quantities such as deflection angle, radius of the
photon sphere, angular separation, relativistic image characteristics, Einstein
ring and time delay. By taking the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) like Sgr
A*, M87*, NGC 1332, NGC 4649 etc. as RN-like BH, we compute the lensing
observables and compare with the observables associated with the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (RNBH). The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of
massless Dirac field perturbation of Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-de Sitter-like
(RNdS-like) BH are also calculated. We discuss the behaviour of both real and
imaginary parts of QNM frequencies with varying of $Q$ and $L$. It shows the
damping rate and the oscillation frequency decrease with increasing $L$ but it
has the opposite effect for the increase of $Q$. We further explore the
detectability of QNMs by LIGO and LISA, and study the impact of $L$ and $Q$ on
the detectable BH mass range. Further, we investigate the behaviour of greybody
factor (GF) of RNdS-like BH in bumblebee gravity and find that the probability
of wave transmission increases with increasing $L$ but decreases with the
increase of $Q$. The behaviour of absorption cross section and sparsity of
Hawking radiation for different values of $L$ and $Q$ are also analysed
graphically.

### [43] [General Boosted Black Holes: A First Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09988)
*Rodrigo Maier*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  paper presents an approximate solution of Einstein's field equations for a boosted Kerr-Newman black hole, showing the solution satisfies field equations up to a fourth-order expansion in 1/r, with specific spacetime structures and field behaviors highlighted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper deals with black holes, specifically their properties under boosting, which is relevant to understanding their dynamics in various reference frames.

Method: They used a twisting metric and BMS group to model the boosted black hole, then built an electromagnetic tensor and tested the field equations up to a certain order. They also analyzed spacetime structures and electromagnetic fields.

Result: Results include detailed analysis of electric and magnetic fields, as well as structures like event horizons and ergospheres, showing the solution is consistent with Kerr-Newman in higher-order terms.

Conclusion: Black hole dynamics in arbitrary boosted directions are modeled accurately, suggesting applicability in broader astrophysical contexts.

Abstract: In this paper we obtain an approximate solution of Einstein field equations
which describes a general boosted Kerr-Newman black hole relative to a Lorentz
frame at future null infinity. The boosted black hole is obtained from a
general twisting metric whose boost emerges from the BMS group. Employing a
standard procedure we build the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor with the
Kerr boosted metric together with its timelike Killing vector as the
electromagnetic potential. We demonstrate that our solution satisfies Einstein
field equations up to a fourth-order expansion in $1/r$, indicating that the
spacetime closely resembles a Kerr-Newman black hole whose boost points in a
arbitrary direction. Spacetime structures of the general black hole -- namely
the event horizon and ergosphere -- are examined in Bondi-Sachs coordinates.
For a proper timelike observer we show that the electric field generated by the
boosted black hole exhibits a purely radial behavior, whereas the magnetic
field develops a complex structure characterized by two pronounced lobes
oriented opposite to the boost direction.

### [44] [Confinement, Nonlocal Observables, and Haag Duality Violation in the Algebraic Structure of 1+1-Dimensional Non-Abelian Gauge Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09172)
*Fidele J. Twagirayezu*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个代数量子场论的框架，研究了1+1维SU(N)规范理论中的 confinement机制和非局域性问题，通过构建局部可观察的C*-代数网，应用了严格的数学方法，得出了关于DHR超选择机制的结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在探索非阿贝尔规范理论中粒子 confinement的机制，尤其是在低维情况下。通过代数量子场论的方法，可以更严谨地分析这些理论的结构，有助于理解规范对称性和相互作用的内在关系。

Method: 研究采用了代数量子场论的框架，构建了局部可观察的C*-代数网，引入了规范不变的复合算子如色单较电流和迹，严格应用了非阿贝尔Gauss定律作为算符约束。通过分析DHR超选择机制，得出了颜色荷为零的结论。此外，引入了非局域威尔逊线算子来描述色荷，讨论了Haag域偶性被破坏的情况。

Result: 研究揭示了在1+1维SU(N)规范理论中，DHR超选择机制中的算子没有携带非零颜色荷。通过引入威尔逊线算子，发现了Haag域偶性破坏的现象，这表明其理论中的全局规范结构和拓扑属性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解SU(N)规范理论中的色荷和非局域性提供了一个严格的代数方法，推论出在这些理论中并未存在带颜色荷的DHR超选择机制，且Haag域偶性被破坏，这在本质上反映了规范理论中的拓扑和全局结构。

Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive and rigorously formulated algebraic
framework for investigating 1+1-dimensional SU(N) gauge theories within the
paradigm of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT), building upon foundational
results established for the Abelian Schwinger model. We meticulously construct
a net of local observable C*-algebras, generated by gauge-invariant composite
operators such as color-singlet currents and traces of non-Abelian electric
fields, with the non-Abelian Gauss's law rigorously enforced as an operator
constraint. Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that no
Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) superselection sectors carry nonzero color charge,
thereby providing a precise and mathematically robust characterization of
confinement in these theories. To fully capture the global gauge structure, we
extend the observable net by incorporating nonlocal Wilson line operators,
which encode string-like color flux configurations essential to the theory's
topological properties. We further establish a structural violation of Haag
duality, showing that certain operators, such as Wilson lines, reside in the
commutant of a local algebra but cannot be localized within the algebra of the
causal complement, a phenomenon driven by nontrivial topological degrees of
freedom. By introducing regularization techniques for operator products and
providing detailed derivations, we ensure mathematical precision. This
nonperturbative, gauge-invariant framework not only elucidates the mechanisms
of confinement and nonlocality but also lays a solid foundation for extending
algebraic methods to higher-dimensional gauge theories and exploring their
quantum information-theoretic implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文章试图通过物理散射过程中的简单性和一致性来确立弦论的基础模型，寻找唯一解。

Method: 文章通过数学推导和理论分析，假设一致性和高能行为，证明了唯一性。

Result: 文章得出结论，Veneziano和Virasoro-Shapiro模型是最小一致性的唯一解，弦论由此建立。

Conclusion: 文章利用假设和推导，确定了弦论的核心模型是唯一的。

Abstract: We argue that string theory emerges inevitably from a few simple assumptions
about physical scattering. Consistency alone requires that all tree-level
four-point scattering amplitudes exhibit vanishing residues at prescribed
values of the momentum transfer. Assuming ultrasoft high-energy behavior, we
then prove that the space of minimally consistent amplitudes, whose residues
exhibit these mandated zeros and nothing more, are precisely the amplitudes of
Veneziano and Virasoro-Shapiro, thus establishing the uniqueness of strings.
Similar logic also applies to five-point scattering.

Method: 作者将Bergshoeff-de Roo的识别扩展到非相对论背景，得到了有限的高阶导数完成，确定了对称变换，尤其是从规范变换中发现了SO(8)的Grassmann机制。

Result: 结果表明高阶导数修正可以通过规范重定义消除，这种机制与先前分析一致。

Conclusion: 文章为在非相对论弦理论背景下加入高曲率动力学提供了系统框架，并验证了这个机制的适用性。这预示着未来可能进一步扩展该框架。

Abstract: We present the first explicit construction of the four-derivative
gravitational corrections to heterotic supergravity in the non-relativistic
(NR) limit. By extending the Bergshoeff-de Roo identification to NR
backgrounds, we obtain a finite higher-derivative completion of the NR
heterotic action and determine its full set of symmetry transformations. A key
outcome is the emergence of a gravitational $SO(8)$ Green-Schwarz mechanism
from the NR gauge transformation of the Kalb-Ramond field. This mechanism can
be trivialized through suitable field redefinitions, in agreement with a
previous analysis of this transformation. Our results establish a systematic
framework for incorporating higher-curvature gravitational dynamics into NR
string heterotic backgrounds.

TL;DR: 研究了两量子系统间通过弱相互作用导热的动态过程，通过随机矩阵理论和共形模型等模型展示了瞬态电流峰值和非平衡稳态态的出现，并导出了这些模型的精确结果，最后通过双扩展Sakai-Kitaev（DSSYK）模型证实了这些特征的存在。

Motivation: 理解量子系统间的热传导机制对量子统计物理和热力学的研究具有重要意义，尤其是通过toy models探索复杂系统的动态行为。

Method: 使用了随机矩阵理论模型和共形场论模型进行理论分析，结合双扩展Sakai-Kitaev模型作为更现实的应用。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解复杂量子热传导系统提供了强大的理论工具和实验基础。

Abstract: We investigate solvable models of heat transport between a pair of quantum
mechanical systems initialized at two different temperatures. At time $t=0$, a
weak interaction is switched on between the systems, and we study the resulting
energy transport. Focusing on the heat current as the primary observable, we
analyze both the transient dynamics and the long-time behavior of the system.
We demonstrate that simple toy models - including Random Matrix Theory like
models ({\it RMT models}) and Schwarzian like models ({\it conformal models}) -
can capture many generic features of heat transport, such as transient current
peaks and the emergence of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). For these
models, we derive a variety of exact results characterizing the short time
transients, long time approach to NESS and thermal conductivity. Finally, we
show how these features appear in a more realistic solvable model, the
Double-Scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. We demonstrate that the DSSYK model
interpolates between the seemingly distinct toy models discussed earlier, with
the toy models in turn providing a useful lens through which to understand the
rich features of DSSYK.

*Finn Gagliano*

TL;DR: Summary of a paper discussing the breaking of non-invertible symmetries in the Standard Model by calculating symmetry breaking scales and effective charges, with an example using QED and Yukawa couplings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses an important aspect of symmetry breaking in quantum field theories, particularly exploring non-invertible symmetries which are less understood than their invertible counterparts.

Method: The authors calculate symmetry breaking scales and effective charges, using QED as a case study by introducing Yukawa couplings between the electron and a massive scalar.

Result: The paper succeeded in quantifying the breaking of non-invertible symmetries, providing new insights into their mechanism and implications in particle physics models.

Conclusion: They conclude that accounting for non-invertible symmetries is crucial for a comprehensive understanding, suggesting future work on general quantification methods and broader applications in particle physics models.

Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the chiral symmetry of the Standard Model
is not explicitly broken by its ABJ anomaly, but is instead made
non-invertible. In this work, I quantify the breaking of non-invertible
symmetries of this type by calculating the symmetry breaking scales and
effective charges $q(r)$ originally studied for continuous invertible
higher-form symmetries. As an example I consider the explicit breaking of the
chiral symmetry of massless QED by introducing Yukawa couplings between the
electron and a massive real scalar in the UV. I briefly comment on how one
might quantify the breaking of general non-invertible symmetries.

TL;DR: 研究通过部分收缩量子态构建转移矩阵后，分析四种熵的定义：修正前熵、SVD熵和ABB熵。发现ABB熵的概率解释与其他熵不同，且与其他熵的行为在实际应用中相似。在所有情况下，ABB熵和SVD熵与单一随机态的子系纠缠熵的表现相似，而修正前熵表现出不同的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子态和转移矩阵的熵定义在理论和实践中的应用，尤其是ABB熵的解读差异，有助于更深入理解纠缠态的性质。

Method: 通过构建转移矩阵和分析不同熵的定义及其概率解释，比较ABB熵与其他熵的行为，分别应用于不同量子态样本。

Result: ABB熵的概率解释唯一对应于两个量子态之间的成对纠缠成功概率。与单一随机态子系的纠缠熵相比，ABB熵和SVD熵表现出相似的行为，而修正前熵则表现出不同的行为，如无界或无缩放性。

Conclusion: 修复后，ABB熵和SVD熵更适合作为研究转移矩阵中纠缠度的衡量指标。找到abb熵的潜在应用有助于深入理解量子态空间中的复杂现象。外延研究可以探讨不同维度和产生分布下的行为变化。

Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two
given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of
entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD
entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each
entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB
entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement
between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix.
Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent
non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged,
whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further
apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several
ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal
eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in
$PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases
considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror
the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in
contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can be unbounded or fails to
scale with system size.

Conclusion: 研究提供了 chaos 和系综平均触发的测地线行为在LLM AdS空间中的理解，补充了量子引力物理的基础。确保了系综平均失效的时间尺度，尚未完全解决，并对未来的研究方向有所启发。

Abstract: We discuss chaos and ensemble averaging in 1/2 BPS bubbling $AdS$ spaces of
Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) by studying trapped and escaping null geodesics
and estimating their decay rates. We find typical chaotic scattering behavior
and confirm the Pesin relation between escape rates, Lyapunov exponents and
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. On the other hand, for geodesics in coarse-grained
(grayscale) LLM geometries (which exhibit a naked singularity) chaos is
strongly suppressed, which is consistent with orbits and escape rates averaged
over microscopic backgrounds. Also the singularities in these grayscale
geometries produce an attractive potential and have some similarities to black
hole throats trapping geodesics for a long time. Overall, averaging over the
ensembles of LLM geometries brings us closer toward the typical behavior of
geodesics in black hole backgrounds, but some important differences remain, in
particular the existence of a threshold timescale when the averaging fails.

*Avijit Sen Majumder,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effect of a non-minimal scalar-gravity interaction on the gravitational potential using quantum loops and scattering processes, finding a potential proportional to ξΛG².


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research looks into non-minimal scalar gravity interactions by examining their impact on gravitational potential through quantum effects and scattering processes, motivated by the need to understand beyond minimal coupling effects in gravitational theories.

Method: The paper uses loop calculations in Feynman diagrams to analyze the interaction, considering one and two graviton exchanges and a three graviton vertex generated by a specific action term. The authors calculate seagull, vacuum polarization, and fish diagrams to find scattering amplitudes which lead to a modified gravitational potential.

Result: The calculation reveals that including a Λ√-g/G term in the action modifies the gravitational potential, finding it proportional to ξΛG².

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their considered non-minimal interaction introduces a distinct gravitational potential, distinguishing it from the minimal case by factors involving the cosmological constant and gravitational coupling.

Abstract: We investigate the contribution of the $\sqrt{-g}\xi R\phi^2$ non-minimal
interaction for a massive scalar to the gravitational potential, found via the
non-relativistic 2-2 scattering with one and two graviton exchanges up to one
loop order. Such coupling can be most naturally motivated from the
renormalisation of a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction in a
curved spacetime. This coupling is qualitatively different from the minimal
ones, like $\sim \sqrt{G} h^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu}$, as the vertices corresponding
to the former does not explicitly contain any scalar momenta, but instead
explicitly contains the momentum of the graviton. We show that the insertion of
one/two graviton-two scalar non-minimal vertices in the standard 2-2 scattering
Feynman diagrams does not yield any contribution for the potential up to one
loop, owing to the aforesaid explicit appearance of graviton's transfer
momentum in the numerator of the Feynman amplitude. In order to complement this
effect, the most natural choice seems to consider the three graviton vertex
generated by the $\sim \Lambda \sqrt{-g}/G$ term in the action, where $\Lambda$
is the cosmological constant. This vertex does not contain explicitly any
graviton momentum. With this, and assuming short scale scattering much small
compared to the Hubble horizon, we compute the seagull, the vacuum polarisation
and the fish diagrams and obtain the non-relativistic scattering amplitudes.
They indeed yield a two body gravitational potential at order $\xi \Lambda
G^2$. We further point out some qualitative differences of this potential with
that of the standard result of $\xi =0$.

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解超对称 SYK 模型的复制现象和其在量子引力中的应用提供了新的视角和理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate the replica problem for Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. First,
we consider $n-$replicas of the non-supersymmetric SYK model, finding that this
$n$-replica model is solvable only under specific conditions. We then introduce
the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and utilize the superconformal symmetry to
develop a ``multi-ordered trick" that covers the replica structure. By
incorporating ordered off-diagonal couplings, we study the resulting thermal
phase structure under higher-order interactions. The Lorentzian time dynamics
is analyzed, and we plot the time evolution of the effective action.
Furthermore, we investigate emergent superconformal symmetry in the low-energy
limit of the replicated theory. In the superconformal limit, we propose an
ordered super-Schwarzian action and derive reparameterization relations for the
ordered coordinates. Corresponding constraints are derived for holographic
matching to $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Jackiw-Teitelboim(SJT) gravity. We
numerically calculate the modular thermodynamics (modular entropy, the
$n$-dependent relative entropy, and the entanglement capacity) using fully
diagonal methods. Our result provide a framework for studying $n$-replica
wormholes with supersymmetric SYK model.

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，在有限半径 AdS 空间框架下，4d 理论的引力效应趋于消失，引力是一维描述量子效应的作用力。

Abstract: We revisit the holographic renormalization group (RG) setting in which a
4-dimensional ($4d$) quantum field theory at a finite cutoff corresponds to/is
described by the Einstein gravity on a part of AdS$_{5}$ space, cutoff at a
finite radius. This holographic setting has interesting and important
implications for the $4d$ field theory: Deformation of the field theory by a
certain combination involving the square of its energy-momentum tensor can be
alternatively viewed as formulating the field theory on a background with a
dynamical metric. Explicitly, starting with a non-gravitating $4d$ field theory
in the UV, flowing to the IR, quantum effects that we compute using the
classical $5d$ Einstein gravity theory, induce an effective $4d$ Einstein
gravity theory. In other words, we show that gravity is not a fundamental force
and is an effective description of quantum effects in the IR limit.

Einstein--Maxwell dilaton theory. We show that these are nothing but a
coordinate transformation in a parent theory related to EMd theory by KK
reduction. Similarly (almost-abelian) bi-vector Yang--Baxter deformations are
coordinate transformations in the doubled space.

### [55] [Learning magic in the Schwinger model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09640)
*Samuel Crew,Hsueh Hao Lu*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We demonstrate the use of variational neural network quantum states to study non-stabilizerness in qubit-regularised quantum field theory. Applying Sinibaldi et al.'s methodology, we numerically compute the stabilizer R'enyi entropy of ground states of the Schwinger model with a topological term. The findings reveal that the magnitude of magic content of these states scales with the separation between external probe charges, indicating the classical hardness of simulating such gauge theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, specifically the non-stabilizerness of certain quantum states. By using neural network quantum states, which are efficient representations of quantum many-body states, the study aims to shed light on the complexity of simulating gauge theories, a topic of significant interest in theoretical physics. The results could have implications for understanding the boundaries of quantum simulation and the role of topological terms in quantum field theories.

Method: The methodology builds upon recent work by Sinibaldi et al. who introduced a framework for computing stabilizer R'enyi entropy. The authors employ variational neural network quantum states to model the ground states of the Schwinger model, a exactly solvable quantum field theory, in its presence of a topological term. By varying the separation between external probe charges, they quantify how the 'magic' or non-stabilizerness content of these states changes, thereby linking it to the classical simulation complexity of the system.

Result: Through numerical computations, the researchers find that the stabilizer R'enyi entropy—quantifying the magic content—scales with the separation between external probe charges. This indicates that as the charges are moved further apart, the quantum state becomes more 'magic,' implying an increased classical hardness in simulating such non-Abelian gauge theories under non-trivial infrared conditions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the utility of variational neural network quantum states in analyzing non-stabilizerness in regularized quantum field theories. Specifically, it shows how the entropy of these states depends on the separation between external charges, providing insights into the classical simulation challenges associated with non-Abelian gauge theories having non-trivial infrared structures. This work not only advances our understanding of quantum field theory but also offers practical implications for quantum simulation efforts, potentially guiding the selection of appropriate quantum resource measures for simulating such complex systems.

*Yuri Makeenko*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper reformulates Wilson's loop equation using a functional Laplace equation and discretizes loop space with polygons to solve it using a path integral approach, achieving results up to order g²N with Feynman diagrams. The approach avoids high-order perturbative calculations by utilizing path integrals, providing an exact solution in this context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of Wilson's loops in QCD, particularly their functional form and perturbative expansion, is crucial for studying gauge theories. This paper presents an alternative method using functional analysis and path integrals, which might offer new insights or simplify existing computations in QCD.

Method: The method involves discretizing loop space into polygons, representing the Green's function of the functional Laplacian as a path integral of a Euclidean harmonic oscillator, and iteratively solving the resulting equation up to a certain order, incorporating Feynman diagrams.

Result: The study successfully reformulates the loop equation into a functional Laplace equation, enabling iterative solutions that yield results matching Feynman diagrams up to order g²N, including the three-gluon vertex diagram. This suggests that their approach provides an exact solution within this perturbative framework.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a novel approach to solving Wilson's loop equations in QCD by using functional Laplacian and path integrals, allowing for exact solutions up to a certain order, which may pave the way for new perturbative techniques in gauge theories.

Abstract: The loop equation satisfied by Wilson's loops in QCD is reformulated as a
functional Laplace equation. Discretizing the loop space by polygons, Green's
function of the functional Laplacian is represented as a path integral of the
Euclidean harmonic oscillator and is applied for an iterative solution of the
equation. It is shown how the usual Feynman's diagrams are reproduced through
order $(g^2N)^2$ including the one with the three-gluon vertex.

Abstract: We propose a symmetrization relation between BPS quivers encoding 4d
$\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and symmetric quivers associated to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$
theories. We analyse in detail the symmetrization of BPS quivers for a series
of $A_m$ Argyres-Douglas theories by engineering 3d-4d systems in geometric
backgrounds involving appropriate 3-manifolds and Riemann surfaces. We discuss
properties of these geometric backgrounds and derive the corresponding quiver
partition functions from the perspective of skein modules, which forms the
foundation of the symmetrization map for the minimal chamber. We also prove
that the structure of wall-crossing in 4d $A_m$ Argyres-Douglas theories is
isomorphic to the structure of unlinking of symmetric quivers encoding their
partner 3d theories, which allows for a proper definition of the symmetrization
map outside the minimal chamber. Finally, we show that the Schur indices of 4d
theories are captured by symmetric quivers that include symmetrization of 4d
BPS quivers.

### [58] [The massive one-loop four-point string amplitude in pure spinor superspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09930)
*Carlos R. Mafra*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper calculates one-loop amplitudes for open and closed strings involving both massless and one first-level massive state using pure spinor superspace. For the open string, the one-loop correlators are expressed in terms of tree-level kinematic factors, and for the closed string, this applies to three-point amplitudes, while for four points, it applies to specific combinations of states dependent on the string type (IIA or IIB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper expands our understanding of string theory by computing loop amplitudes with a mix of mass states. This is important because loop computations are complex, and finding simplifications can lead to deeper insights into the theory's structure, potential dualities, and possible applications in phenomenology or AdS/CFT.

Method: The authors use pure spinor superspace, a formalism involving operators and BRST invariance, to calculate the amplitudes. They derive expressions for both open and closed string cases, particularly focusing on four-point configurations where conditions on the states are specified to allow the use of tree-level factors.

Result: New expressions are derived for the one-loop amplitudes, expressed in terms of simpler tree-level factors. This simplification is significant for computational efficiency and could reveal connections between loop and tree-level contributions, aiding in the exploration of string theory's mathematical structure.

Conclusion: The results suggest that one-loop amplitudes in string theory can be simplified using pure spinor techniques, especially when combining different mass states. This provides a new tool for string theory computations and contributes to the theoretical understanding of loop effects in string amplitudes.

Abstract: The open- and closed-string three- and four-point one-loop amplitudes
involving massless states and one first-level massive state are computed in
pure spinor superspace. For the open string, we show that their one-loop
correlators can be rewritten in terms of tree-level kinematic factors. We then
analyze the closed string. For three points, this is immediate. For four
points, we show that it is possible to rewrite the one-loop closed-string
correlator using tree-level kinematic factors, but only for certain
combinations of massive and massless states (different for type IIA and IIB).

Result: 在临界温度下，相变发生，区分本地CFT和非本地弦理论相态。

Conclusion: 提供新的相变机制，促进对复杂量子场论和弦理论之间关系的理解。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of single-trace $T\bar{T}$-holography
where the boundary field theory can be realized as a CFT$_2$ deformed by a
single-trace irrelevant operator of dimension $(2,2)$ and dual spacetime
geometry is $AdS_3$ smoothly glued to flat spacetime with a linear dilaton near
the boundary. In this non-AdS holographic framework, we propose that the length
of real extremal curves connecting the two boundaries of an eternal black hole
at fixed boundary time captures the time-evolved entanglement entropy of an
entangled, quenched boundary system. At late times, we find two analytic
extremal solutions in the complexified geometry, which become real in
complementary temperature regimes. Focusing only on the real solutions leads to
a non-analyticity at a critical temperature $T_c$, which we interpret as a
second-order phase transition separating a local (CFT$_2$) phase from a
non-local (Little String Theory) phase.

designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and
training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络（GAN）在数据生成方面表现出色，但经典GAN依赖于经典噪声生成潜在空间，而量子GAN在模拟器上的表现受到噪声模型影响。因此，研究HQC GAN在模拟器中的生成能力。

Method: 研究比较了经典GAN与三种不同量子位数的HQC GAN（3、5、7个量子位），使用Qiskit的AerSimulator带有噪声模型，并使用FID和KID评估性能。

Result: 7个量子位的HQC GAN在FID和KID评分上接近经典GAN，尽管在早期收敛困难，但训练时间增加有限。

Conclusion: 量子增强的GAN在现有量子硬件上有可能成为有效的生成模型。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained
by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical
noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs
(HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum
circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a
classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using
Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum
devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the
low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are
trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and
Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN
achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance,
narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier
convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training
time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the
feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures,
highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the
constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

Abstract: Aquantummemoryforlightisexpectedtoplayacrucialroleinquantumcommunicationprotocols

Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser

depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of
a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference
occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a
well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of
Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring
similar capability to quantum optical systems.

Abstract: Qubit-resolved operations and measurements are required for most current
quantum information processing schemes. However, these operations can be
experimentally costly due to the need for local addressing, demanding
significant classical control. A more resource-efficient alternative to extract
information is uniform measurement, where a site-independent rotation of qubits
is performed before measuring in the computational basis. This operation can be
performed in parallel, or globally, in atom- and ion-based platforms, reducing
resource cost and increasing fidelity. In this work, we initiate the
exploration of the utility of this operation in quantum information processing.
In particular, we demonstrate that uniform measurements can certify certain
graph states, a family of highly entangled and broadly useful quantum states.
We provide a sample-efficient certification algorithm with a proved performance
guarantee, together with an experimental scheme based on analog-mode Rydberg
atom arrays. Uniform measurements, therefore, allow direct and efficient
characterization of quantum states on quantum platforms in a hitherto
unexplored manner.

TL;DR: Non-Gaussian states are key for quantum advantages in CV info processing. This paper introduces displaced Janus states, which are superpositions of squeezed coherent states. The study provides a comprehensive analytical framework with new polynomials, leading to hyperESS results on their quantum stats, including bunching and suppression.

Motivation: Quantum computing and information processing rely on non-Gaussian states for quantum advantages. This paper addresses a gap in understanding the higher-order quantum statistics of specific non-Gaussian states, aiming to provide a framework for their characterization and application.

Method: The paper introduces displaced Janus states and a new set of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials. It derives closed-form expressions for higher-order coherence functions, Wigner function, and quantum Fisher information, enabling a detailed characterization of the states' properties.

Result: The study reveals how quantum interference can transform extreme photon bunching into strong antibunching or perfect multiphoton suppression. It identifies parameter regimes for Wigner negativity and Heisenberg-limited metrological precision, offering tools for hybrid quantum protocols and fault-tolerant CV computation.

Conclusion: This work establishes the displaced Janus state as a crucial resource for advancing hybrid quantum protocols and fault-tolerant continuous-variable computation by providing analytical tools and characterizations of their quantum properties.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving a quantum advantage in
continuous-variable (CV) information processing. Among these, superpositions of
squeezed states offer a rich phenomenology, yet a complete analytical
understanding of their higher-order quantum statistics-such as the transition
from extreme bunching ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to suppression ($g^{(k>2)} \to
0$)-has remained elusive. In this work, we introduce and provide an exact
solution for the displaced Janus state-a coherent superposition of two squeezed
coherent states. We develop a powerful analytical framework built upon a new
family of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials that yields closed-form expressions
for its arbitrary-order coherence functions, Wigner function, and quantum
Fisher information. This enables a full characterization of the state's tunable
non-Gaussianity, revealing how quantum interference can transform the extreme
photon bunching of its components into strong antibunching or perfect
multiphoton suppression. We identify parameter regimes that generate Wigner
negativity and can be harnessed for achieving Heisenberg-limited metrological
precision. Our work provides a foundational toolkit for engineering
non-Gaussian states, establishing the displaced Janus state as a key resource
for hybrid quantum protocols and fault-tolerant CV computation.

Method: 使用代数场论和分析Floquet体系的频谱 cyclotomic 结构，计算高效地确定所有可能的回响时间。

Conclusion: Floquet量子系统中回响时间不仅依赖系统参数，还与长时间动力学复杂性相关，在量子控制和热力学中具有重要应用。

Abstract: The Poincar\'e recurrence theorem shows that conservative systems in a
bounded region of phase space eventually return arbitrarily close to their
initial state after a finite amount of time. An analogous behavior occurs in
certain quantum systems where quantum states can recur after sufficiently long
unitary evolution, a phenomenon known as quantum recurrence. Periodically
driven (i.e. Floquet) quantum systems in particular exhibit complex dynamics
even in small dimensions, motivating the study of how interactions and
Hamiltonian structure affect recurrence behavior. While most existing studies
treat recurrence in an approximate, distance-based sense, here we address the
problem of exact, state-independent recurrences in a broad class of
finite-dimensional Floquet systems, spanning both integrable and non-integrable
models. Leveraging techniques from algebraic field theory, we construct an
arithmetic framework that identifies all possible recurrence times by analyzing
the cyclotomic structure of the Floquet unitary's spectrum. This
computationally efficient approach yields both positive results, enumerating
all candidate recurrence times and definitive negative results, rigorously
ruling out exact recurrences for given Hamiltonian parameters. We further prove
that rational Hamiltonian parameters do not, in general, guarantee exact
recurrence, revealing a subtle interplay between system parameters and
long-time dynamics. Our findings sharpen the theoretical understanding of
quantum recurrences, clarify their relationship to quantum chaos, and highlight
parameter regimes of special interest for quantum metrology and control.

Conclusion:  the paper suggests that symmetry should play a vital role in organizing and developing quantum algorithms, which will not only bridge quantum computing with theoretical physics but also enhance practical quantum technologies.

Abstract: We propose a taxonomy for quantum algorithms grounded in the fundamental

Abstract: We study the quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by an atomic
ensemble when the ensemble is initially prepared in a superradiant Dicke state.
We show that while the radiation is well approximated by the Glauber coherent
state at early times in the evolution, the emission can be truly quantum at
later times. In particular, one can observe a large amount of photon-number
squeezing in the emission under certain conditions; even a Fock state can be
produced. We discuss the quantum statistics of the emission for various
parameters, including different initial conditions for the atomic ensemble. To
obtain these results, we have developed a formalism where we are able to
calculate the quantum statistics of the emission over long time-scales even
when the number of atoms in the ensemble is quite large.

qubit types within the lattice, and parameter regimes that circumvent the
capacitive loading problem commonly associated with fluxoniums. In numerical
simulations, we show a parametrically driven CZ-gate that achieves a
closed-system infidelity that is orders of magnitude below the coherence limit
for gate durations $\gtrsim 30\,\rm{ns}$ using a two-tone flux pulse on the
tunable coupler. Furthermore, we show that this gate scheme retains its
fidelity in the presence of spectator qubits, making it a scalable solution for
large lattices. Moreover, for the implementation of error correcting codes, our
approach can leverage the long coherence times and large non-linearities of
fluxoniums as data qubits, while fixed-frequency transmons with established
readout techniques can serve as measurement ancillas.

Conclusion:  Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions（QPUFs）在理论上为安全认证提供了坚实的基础，但在实际应用中仍存在诸多障碍，亟需进一步研究以克服这些挑战。

Abstract: Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs) offer a physically grounded
approach to secure authentication, extending the capabilities of classical
PUFs. This review covers their theoretical foundations and key implementation
challenges - such as quantum memories and Haar-randomness -, and distinguishes
QPUFs from Quantum Readout PUFs (QR-PUFs), more experimentally accessible yet
less robust against quantum-capable adversaries. A co-citation-based selection
method is employed to trace the evolution of QPUF architectures, from early
QR-PUFs to more recent Hybrid PUFs (HPUFs). This method further supports a
discussion on the role of information-theoretic analysis in mitigating
inconsistencies in QPUF responses, underscoring the deep connection between
secret-key generation and authentication. Despite notable advances, achieving
practical and robust QPUF-based authentication remains an open challenge.

### [71] [Quantum correction to the Langevin cross section in resonant-exchange processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09302)
*I. Simbotin,R. Côté*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses resonant-exchange scattering, focusing on phase shift locking and its impact on cross sections at different energy levels, and provides an analytical method to model this behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding low-temperature dynamics and transport phenomena is crucial, especially in fields like condensed matter physics and nuclear physics where scattering processes dominate system behavior.

Method: The authors generalize their existing model to account for phase shift locking and its gradual release with energy increases, developing an analytical expression for the cross section that considers these factors and validates it through computational results for charge-transfer processes.

Result: The analytical model accurately predicts resonant-exchange cross sections, demonstrating particularly good agreement when phase shifts are locked, and their method accounts for the transition from s-wave dominance to higher energy contributions.

Conclusion: This work enhances our understanding of resonant-exchange scattering and provides a valuable tool for predicting cross sections in various systems where phase shifts play a key role.

Abstract: Resonant-exchange scattering plays a key role in many-body dynamics and
transport phenomena (such as spin, charge, or excitation diffusion) at low and
moderate temperatures. Recent investigations have shown that the locking of
phase shifts is central to resonant-exchange scattering at low energies.
Moreover, phase-shift locking causes an unexpected behavior, namely the
resonant-exchange cross section over a broad range of energies is largely
dictated by $s$-wave scattering, whose influence extends high above the
$s$-wave Wigner regime. Here, we generalize our previous treatment to higher
energies and derive an analytical expression for the resonant-exchange cross
section which depends on a few parameters and accounts not only for the locking
of phase shifts, but also for their gradual unlocking with increased energy. We
find good agreement between the computed (fully quantal) cross sections and
those obtained with our expression, which we illustrate in great detail for the
case of resonant charge-transfer in ion-atom collisions.

Abstract: We study the bound states in the continuum (BIC) in a system of two identical
two-level giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. By deriving
general dark-state conditions, we clarify how coupling configurations and
atomic parameters influence decay suppression. Through analysis of the
long-time dynamical behaviors of atoms and bound photons, we carry out a
detailed classification of bound states and explore the connections between
these dynamical behaviors and the system's intrinsic light-matter interactions.
The system supports static bound states with persistent atomic excitations, and
oscillating bound states with periodic atom-photon or atom-atom excitation
exchange. Under certain conditions, oscillating bound states can contain more
harmonic components owing to the emergence of additional quasi-dark modes,
rendering them promising platforms for high-capacity quantum information
processing. These findings advance the understanding of BIC in waveguide
quantum electrodynamics with multiple giant atoms and reveal their prospective
applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Carrier transport in quantum networks is governed by a variety of factors,
including network dimensionality and connectivity, on-site energies, couplings
between sites and whether they are short- or long-range, and environmental
effects. In this work, we identify classes of quasi-one-dimensional chains with
energy profiles that optimize carrier transport under such influences.
Specifically, we optimize on-site energies using Optax's optimistic gradient
descent and AdaMax algorithms, enabled by the JAX automatic differentiation
framework. Focusing on steady-state transport, we study the system's behavior
under combined unitary and nonunitary (dephasing and dissipative) effects using
the Lindblad quantum master equation. After validating our optimization scheme
on short chains, we extend the study to larger systems where we identify
systematic patterns in energy profiles. Our analysis reveals that different
types of energy landscape enhance transport, depending on whether inter-site
tunneling couplings in the chain are short- or long-range, the existence of
environmental interactions, and the temperature of the environment. Our
classification and insights of optimal energy landscapes offer guidance for
designing efficient transport systems for electronic, photovoltaic and quantum
communication applications.

This finding is crucial for controlling relaxation and decoherence in quantum systems, with wide-ranging implications.

Abstract: In dissipative bosonic systems, dephasing is typically expected to accelerate
relaxation and suppress coherent dynamics. However, we show that in networks of
coherently coupled bosonic modes with non-uniform local dissipation, the
presence of quasi-dark states leads to a nontrivial response to dephasing:
while weak dephasing facilitates equilibration, moderate to strong dephasing
induces a pronounced slowdown of relaxation, revealing the existence of an
optimal dephasing rate that enhances equilibration. Using exact dynamical
equations for second-order moments, we demonstrate that dephasing suppresses
coherent transport and gives rise to long-lived collective modes that dominate
the system's late-time behavior. This phenomenon bears striking similarities to
Lifshitz-tail states, which are known in disordered systems to cause
anomalously slow relaxation. Our results uncover a counterintuitive mechanism
by which dephasing, rather than promoting equilibration, can dynamically
decouple specific modes from dissipation, thereby protecting excitations. These
findings highlight how non-Hermitian physics in open bosonic systems can give
rise to unexpected dynamical regimes, paving the way for new strategies to
control relaxation and decoherence in bosonic quantum systems, with broad
implications for both experimental and theoretical quantum science.

Abstract: When undertaking continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) across
atmospheric channels, strong classical local oscillators (LOs) are often
polarization-multiplexed with the weak quantum signals for coherent measurement
at the receiver. Although the wavefronts of the quantum signal and LO are often
assumed to experience the same distortion across channels, previous theoretical
work has shown that they can experience differential distortions, resulting in
relative wavefront errors (WFEs). Such errors have previously been shown to
limit CV-QKD performance, in some cases leading to zero secure key rates. In
this work, for the first time, we provide strong experimental evidence that
relative WFEs are present in some circumstances and that standard assumptions
in CV-QKD deployments may need to be revisited. In addition, we demonstrate how
turbulence can affect the detailed form of the relative WFEs, thereby
indicating that long-range links like terrestrial-satellite channels are likely
impacted more than short-range terrestrial-only channels.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the average subsystem Bures distance in a quantum spin chain, addressing challenges in integrable systems by developing an efficient algorithm and ordering eigenstates. They find that in the transverse-field Ising chain, subsystem Bures distances scale linearly with size in chaotic systems, while scaling doesn't hold for random Gaussian states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the applicability of quantum distance measures like Bures distance in studying many-body quantum chaos, particularly in systems where traditional indicators like trace distance are difficult to compute. By focusing on the spin-1/2 transverse-field Ising chain, the authors seek to provide a methodological advance in analyzing integrable systems.

Method: The authors develop an efficient algorithm for calculating the Bures distance between two Gaussian states. To handle the challenge of ordering eigenstates, they employ simultaneous eigenstates of all local conserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate states. This approach allows them to tackle larger system sizes and effectively compute the distances.

Result: The results confirm the conjecture that subsystem Bures distances in chaotic systems increase linearly with subsystem size. Additionally, the study shows that the scaling behavior of Bures distances differs from that of trace distances in chaotic vs integrable systems, with Bures distances indicating clear scaling in chaotic cases.

Conclusion: This work provides a promising framework for using quantum distance measures like the Bures distance to probe many-body quantum chaos, particularly in systems with conserved quantities. The algorithmic advancements and systematic state ordering significantly enhance the accessibility of quantum distance measures to larger systems.

Abstract: The average subsystem trace distance has been proposed as an indicator of
quantum many-body chaos and integrability. In integrable systems, evaluating
the trace distance faces two challenges: the computational cost for large
systems and ambiguities in defining and ordering eigenstates. In this paper, we
calculate the average subsystem Bures distance in the spin-1/2 transverse-field
Ising chain. We develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the Bures distance
between two Gaussian states, which allows us to access larger system sizes. To
address the degeneracy issue, we consider simultaneous eigenstates of all local
conserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate
states. The results align with the conjectured linear increase with subsystem
size. We demonstrate that the distinct scaling behaviors of the average
subsystem trace and Bures distances in chaotic versus integrable systems stem
from discontinuities of local conserved charges across the spectrum in
integrable systems. Additionally, we investigate the average subsystem
distances between random pure Gaussian states but do not observe a linear
increase.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CVQSS) is a promising approach to
ensuring multi-party information security. While CVQSS offers practical ease of
implementation, its present performance remains limited. In this paper, we
propose a novel CVQSS protocol integrated with a state-discrimination detector
(SDD), dubbed SDD-CVQSS. In particular, we first develop the detailed procedure
of SDD-CVQSS, which replaces the traditional coherent detector with an SDD and
eliminates the long-standing necessary step of establishing multiple
point-to-point quantum key distribution links between all users and the dealer.
We then elaborate on the principle of the specifically designed SDD, which can
efficiently discriminate mixed states with a much lower error probability.
Finally, we construct a security model for SDD-CVQSS and derive its security
bound against beam-splitting collective attacks. Numerical simulations show
that SDD-CVQSS outperforms conventional CVQSS in both maximum transmission
distance and secret key rate, even surpassing the PLOB bound. Additionally, we
find that the performance degradation of SDD-CVQSS in long-distance
transmission scenarios can be effectively compensated for using a
post-selection scheme, providing a feasible way to achieve high-performance
CVQSS.

Abstract: Parrondo's paradox describes a counterintuitive phenomenon where alternating
between two individually losing games results in a winning expectation. While
its classical origin relies on capital-dependent bias and noise-induced
asymmetry, realizing a robust quantum version of the paradox has remained
challenging, especially under the constraint of single-qubit coin systems. In
this work, we demonstrate that a genuine quantum Parrondo effect can emerge in
discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) by alternating two SU(2) coin operators and
introducing a localized phase shift at the origin. Through a series of
numerical experiments, we show that this minimal model, without entanglement or
high-dimensional coins, exhibits sustained positive drift only in the presence
of spatial inhomogeneity. We analyze the role of phase angle, coin parameters,
and game sequences, and identify optimal regions in which constructive
interference enables paradoxical transport. Our findings validate recent
theoretical claims that translational symmetry breaking is essential for
overcoming interference-induced cancellation, thereby enabling directed quantum
motion. This work opens new possibilities for realizing counterintuitive
quantum dynamics using low-resource architectures, with potential applications
in quantum control, energy harvesting, and coherence-assisted transport.

Abstract: Quantum reference frame transformations have been proposed to provide a means
by which to translate descriptions of quantum systems relative to each other.
At present, there are several differing frameworks for describing quantum
reference frames, with concomitantly different transformation rules. Here, we
investigate a simple example of three qubit systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry in order to analyze physical and conceptual distinctions between three
contemporary approaches to quantum reference frames -- dubbed
perspective-neutral, extra particle and operational. By constructing two
three-qubit states that are indistinguishable by observables relative to one
frame but are distinguishable by observables relative to another, we show that
each of the three approaches provides a distinct transformation rule, which may
be understood to reflect differing attitudes towards the global state and the
information that can be accessed by each frame. This helps us to shed light on
the operational meaning of each approach and the contexts in which they may be
most naturally applied.

Abstract: Universal quantum computers promise to solve computational problems that are
beyond the capabilities of known classical algorithms. To realize such quantum

superconducting quantum circuits in a semiconductor fabrication facility. In
order to set a baseline for the process quality, we report on the fabrication
of coplanar waveguide resonators in a 200 mm production line, making use of a
two-layer superconducting circuit technology. We demonstrate high material and
process quality by cryogenic Q-factor measurements exceeding $10^6$ in the
single-photon regime, for microwave resonators made of both Niobium and
Tantalum. In addition, we demonstrate the incorporation of superconducting
Niobium air bridges in our process, while maintaining the high quality factor

with a hypothetical game that exploits a recent quantum algorithm for computing

Abstract: We study Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in the presence of non-Markovian

intermediate rates of dissipation. We analyze the effect of non-Markovian
dynamics on BTCs using quantum Fisher information, order parameter, a measure
of non-Markovianity, and a dynamical phase diagram, all of which show complex
behaviours with changing non-Markovianity parameters. Our studies can pave the
way for stabilizing time crystals in dissipative systems, as well as lead to

Abstract: Ground-state cooling is essential for accessing the quantum regime and
enabling quantum control of macroscopic systems. However, achieving
optomechanical cooling in the unresolved-sideband regime ($\omega_b < \kappa$)
remains challenging. In this Letter, we propose an efficient cooling strategy
based on a hybrid optomechanical system incorporating a yttrium iron garnet
(YIG) sphere embedded in an optomechanical cavity. Under strong cavity driving,
the Kerr nonlinearity of the magnons hosted in the YIG sphere gives rise to a
two-magnon process. Adiabatic elimination of the magnons yields an effective
two-photon process in the cavity, which destructively interferes with all
dissipative channels, surpassing the quantum backaction limit and enabling
\textit{complete suppression} of heating under optimal conditions, even in the
deeply unresolved sideband regime (DUSR: $\omega_b \ll \kappa$). Moreover,
injecting squeezed vacuum noise into the cavity not only preserves these
advantages but also delivers additional enhancements, including higher net
cooling rates, reduced optomechanical coupling requirements, and improved noise
robustness. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms existing
schemes without Kerr magnons, underscoring the potential of integrating
nonlinear magnonics with optomechanics for quantum control of macroscopic
mechanical systems.

Motivation: 研究纠缠态认证在物理实验中的重要性，尤其是当量子态部分已知时，寻找一种高效的认证方法是当前研究的热点。

Method: 基于Faddeev-LeVerrier算法，使用部分正定的但不是完全正定的映射，计算输出态的负本征值来判断纠缠态。

Result: 该方法通过对特定映射的选择，有效地检测到负本征值，证明了纠缠的存在。

Conclusion: 该纠缠认证方法操作简便，计算资源消耗低，是一种更具吸引力的新型方法，适用于量子信息处理等领域的实验研究。

Abstract: Entanglement certification is crucial in physical experiments, particularly
when only partial knowledge of the quantum state is available. In this context,
we present an entanglement criterion based on positive but not completely
positive maps, which eliminates the need to identify eigenvalues of the output
state. Notably, the Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm establishes a relationship
between the coefficients of characteristic polynomials and the moments of a
matrix. This enables the existence of negative eigenvalues through the moments
of the output state. The effectiveness of our criterion relies on the selection
of positive maps, similar to the original positive maps criterion.

TL;DR: The paper examines QGANs and finds they struggle to generalize beyond datasets, particularly due to limitations in their generator and discriminator structures and the nature of their quantum implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the capabilities and limitations of QGANs in quantum image generation tasks, which is important for advancing quantum machine learning models.

Method: The authors conducted numerical testing of existing QGAN architectures and derived a lower bound for discriminator quality based on generator outputs.

Result: QGANs perform poorly in generalizing beyond training data, especially when the generator produces pure states, resulting in the discriminator only capturing the average dataset characteristics.

Conclusion: This reveals significant limitations in current QGAN models, suggesting the need for improved architectures and theoretical frameworks to address these challenges in quantum machine learning.

Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks
(QGANs) in image generations tasks. Our analysis centers on fully quantum
implementations of both the generator and discriminator. Through extensive
numerical testing of current main architectures, we find that QGANs struggle to
generalize across datasets, converging on merely the average representation of
the training data. When the output of the generator is a pure-state, we
analytically derive a lower bound for the discriminator quality given by the
fidelity between the pure-state output of the generator and the target data
distribution, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the limitations
observed in current models. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in the
generalization capabilities of existing quantum generative models. While our
analysis focuses on QGANs, the results carry broader implications for the
performance of related quantum generative models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seems important as it revisits the fundamental principles of quantum optics and applies symmetry to enhance understanding and applications in metrology. Quantum interference and sensing are critical areas, so the implications for metrology are particularly relevant. The generalization to more than two modes is a significant advancement, potentially opening new possibilities in quantum information technologies. The focus on symmetry simplifying existing knowledge makes it a valuable contribution to the field. However, the abstract lacks specifics, so more details on how the symmetry is applied and what the precision bounds actually show would be helpful. The study seems to offer a promising framework, but examples or applications are missing. This makes it a good candidate for further research, but the abstract is too vague on precise outcomes.

Method: The paper likely uses theoretical analysis, possibly including quantum state analysis and symmetry considerations. It might derive general expressions for interferometers with multiple modes and compare them to existing setups. The framework could integrate insights from discrete Fourier transforms and interferometry to extend the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. The approach emphasizes symmetry properties, which is central to the method, enabling the abstraction and generalization of the interferometer's behavior for different input states and modes. Objective functions or equations related to precision bounds are probably derived, showing how symmetry affects metrology capabilities. The method combines theoretical derivations with analysis of symmetry and its applications in quantum sensing. 

Result: The study indicates that expanding beyond two-mode, single-photon states and multi-mode setups significantly enhances the interferometer's applications. By leveraging symmetry and Fourier transforms, the generalized interferometers improve precision in quantum metrology. The precise bounds computation provides a quantitative measure, highlights the role of symmetry in determining metrological limits. This framework for quantum sensing and interference opens new research directions and applications, though concrete examples or applications are missing. The results unify known two-mode outcomes and extend them while offering a systematic approach for future studies in quantum optics and metrology. 

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the central role of symmetry in the generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. It offers a unified framework for understanding quantum interference and metrology, facilitating advancements in quantum information technologies. The framework simplifies known results and opens possibilities for new developments. The conclusion underscores the importance of symmetry in quantum interference and sensing, providing a valuable tool for future research in quantum optics and metrology. The study highlights the framework's potential to advance the field but leaves concrete application examples and further results to future works. It leaves the door open for exploring applications in quantum computing, communication, and sensing, suggesting broad impacts in quantum technologies. The framework's role in simplifying and unifying research makes it a valuable contribution, suggesting that the next steps involve applying the framework to specific scenarios, such as quantum communication protocols, computing architectures, and sensing devices.

Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer is a foundational tool in quantum optics,
with both fundamental and practical significance. Earlier works identified that
input-state symmetry under exchange of the two spatial modes is fundamental in
the understanding of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We now show that this notion of
symmetry is central to generalizing this effect. In particular, this point of
view enables the construction of extensions beyond the standard two
single-photon case to arbitrary input states, as well as to configurations with
more than two spatial modes via a natural generalization of the beam splitter
to a discrete Fourier transform interferometer. Beyond its conceptual
significance, this framework offers direct insights into quantum metrology,
showing how symmetry properties of input states allow the computation of
explicit precision bounds. By focusing on symmetry, we provide a perspective
that simplifies and unifies a range of known results, while paving the way for
new developments in quantum interference and sensing.

*Kübra Yeter-Aydeniz,Nora M. Bauer,Pranay Jain,Max Masnick*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes quantum-enhanced diffusion and VAE models for image generation, showing superior performance compared to classical models, especially with noisy testing confirming higher quality images made by quantum models. They can be a target for future research in industrial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing's potential in advancing deep learning models, particularly in medical imaging where high-quality data is crucial, drives this research to explore quantum-enhanced generative models.

Method: The authors conducted numerical experiments comparing quantum-enhanced models with classical diffusion and VAE models on fundus retinal image generation tasks. They measured image quality using classification metrics and compared feature distributions. Noisy testing was performed using quantum hardware noise to validate results.

Result: Quantum-enhanced models generated higher quality images, classified as gradable by 86% vs. 69% for classical models, and matched real image distribution better. Noisy testing confirmed quantum models can produce higher fidelity images despite hardware noise.

Conclusion: Quantum diffusion models demonstrate significant potential for use in industrially relevant generative modeling tasks, particularly in medical imaging where image quality is critical, suggesting they are promising targets for further research to leverage quantum computing's advantages.

Abstract: Generative learning models in medical research are crucial in developing
training data for deep learning models and advancing diagnostic tools, but the
problem of high-quality, diverse images is an open topic of research.
Quantum-enhanced generative models have been proposed and tested in the
literature but have been restricted to small problems below the scale of
industry relevance. In this paper, we propose quantum-enhanced diffusion and
variational autoencoder (VAE) models and test them on the fundus retinal image
generation task. In our numerical experiments, the images generated using
quantum-enhanced models are of higher quality, with 86% classified as gradable
by external validation compared to 69% with the classical model, and they match
more closely in features to the real image distribution compared to the ones
generated using classical diffusion models, even when the classical diffusion
models are larger than the quantum model. Additionally, we perform noisy
testing to confirm the numerical experiments, finding that quantum-enhanced
diffusion model can sometimes produce higher quality images, both in terms of
diversity and fidelity, when tested with quantum hardware noise. Our results
indicate that quantum diffusion models on current quantum hardware are strong
targets for further research on quantum utility in generative modeling for
industrially relevant problems.

Abstract: High-fidelity control of the thousands to millions of programmable qubits
needed for utility-scale quantum computers presents a formidable challenge for
control systems. In leading atomic systems, control is optical: UV-NIR beams
must be fanned out over numerous spatial channels and modulated to implement
gates. While photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a potentially scalable
solution, they also need to simultaneously feature high-speed and
high-extinction modulation, strong inter-channel isolation, and broad
wavelength compatibility. Here, we introduce and experimentally validate a
foundry-fabricated PIC platform that overcomes these limitations. Designed for
Rubidium-87 neutral atom quantum computers, our 8-channel PICs, fabricated on a
200-mm wafer process, demonstrate an advanced combination of performance
metrics. At the 795 nm single-qubit gate wavelength, we achieve a mean
extinction ratio (ER) of 71.4 $\pm$ 1.1 dB, nearest-neighbor on-chip crosstalk
of -68.0 $\pm$ 1.0 dB, and -50.8 $\pm$ 0.2 dB after parallel beam delivery in
free-space. This high-performance operation extends to the 420 nm and 1013 nm
wavelengths for two-qubit Rydberg gates, showing ERs of 42.4 dB
(detector-limited) and 61.5 dB, respectively. The devices exhibit 10-90% rise
times of 26 $\pm$ 7 ns, achieve dynamic switching to -60 dB levels within
microsecond timescales, and show pulse stability errors at the $10^{-3}$ level.
This work establishes a scalable platform for developing advanced large-scale
optical control required in fault-tolerant quantum computers and other
precision technologies.

*Maryam Mudassar,Alexander Schuckert,Daniel Gottesman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana-based systems, focusing on logical qubit encoding into even and odd codes. It introduces transversal gadgets, measurements, and error correction schemes, including a novel use of quantum reference frames for odd codes. The framework is applicable to devices like Majorana nanowires and neutral atoms and is asymptotically good, suggesting a promising approach for scalable quantum computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault-tolerant quantum computation is crucial for scalable and reliable quantum devices, and Majorana-based systems are promising due to their inherent protection against noise. This paper addresses the development of necessary elements for such computation in these platforms.

Method: The paper proposes a general framework that divides Majorana codes into even and odd families and develops fault-tolerant gadgets, measurements, and error correction. It employs transversal operations and addresses parity superselection issues by utilizing quantum reference frames for odd codes. An asymptotically good LDPC code is constructed for Majorana qubits.

Result: The presented framework successfully integrates state preparation, gates, measurements, and error correction, demonstrating that Majorana-based systems can fully implement fault-tolerant quantum computation. This includes solving parity superselection problems and showing asymptotic scalability.

Conclusion: The work establishes a comprehensive method for fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana-based hardware, highlighting the feasibility of scalable devices for practical quantum computing tasks.

Abstract: Majorana-based quantum computation in nanowires and neutral atoms has gained
prominence as a promising platform to encode qubits and protect them against
noise. In order to run computations reliably on such devices, a fully
fault-tolerant scheme is needed for state preparation, gates, and measurements.
However, current fault-tolerant schemes have either been limited to specific
code families or have not been developed fully. In this work, we develop a
general framework for fault-tolerant computation with logical degrees encoded
into Majorana hardware. We emphasize the division between even and odd Majorana
codes and how it manifests when constructing fault tolerant gadgets for these
families. We provide transversal constructions and supplement them with
measurements to obtain several examples of fault tolerant Clifford gadgets. For
the case of odd codes, we give a novel construction for gadgets using quantum
reference frames, that allows to implement operations that are forbidden due to
parity superselection. We also provide a fault-tolerant measurement scheme for
Majorana codes inspired by Steane error correction, enabling state preparation,
measurement of logical operations and error correction. We also point out a
construction for odd Majorana codes with transversal T gates. Finally, we
construct an asympotically good quantum LDPC Majorana code with qubit degrees
of freedom. Our work shows that all necessary elements of fault-tolerant
quantum computation can be consistently implemented in fermionic hardware such
as Majorana nanowires and fermionic neutral atoms.

Abstract: In this work we improve the quantum communication rates of various quantum
channels of interest using permutation-invariant quantum codes. We focus in
particular on parametrized families of quantum channels and aim to improve
bounds on their quantum capacity threshold, defined as the lowest noise level
at which the quantum capacity of the channel family vanishes. These thresholds
are important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful
quantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact
that independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any
permutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output
states can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the
symmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient
algorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a
permutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent
information values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100
channel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically
relevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure
channel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing
channel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their
quantum capacities. For example, for the 2-Pauli and BB84 channel families we
significantly improve the best known quantum capacity thresholds derived in
[Fern, Whaley 2008]. These threshold improvements are achieved using a
repetition code-like input state with non-orthogonal code states, which we
further analyze in our representation-theoretic framework.

Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigated the
quasiparticle and spin dynamics in single crystals of bilayer nickelate
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the
presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset
temperatures at $\sim$140 K and $\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity
measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\rm
SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic
nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge
order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to
photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of
approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200
$\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to
approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical
insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explains why the anomalous Hall effect in URhGe is due to non-symmorphic symmetry rather than Berry curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a significant phenomenon in materials science, and understanding its underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing new materials. URhGe is an alternating ferromagnet with unique symmetry properties, making it an interesting case study.

Method: The authors conducted theoretical analysis using symmetry principles and calculations, likely examining the electronic structure and Berry curvature properties of URhGe.

Result: The study reveals that the AHE in URhGe arises because of its non-symmorphic symmetry, which causes the Berry curvature to be zero, unlike previous assumptions.

Conclusion: This finding corrects the understanding of the AHE mechanism in URhGe and opens new avenues for exploring other materials with similar symmetry properties.

Abstract: It is well known that the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic and strongly
paramagnetic metals in addition to electron skew scattering on impurities is
determined by internal mechanism linked to the Berry curvature, a
quantum-mechanical property of the electron states of a perfect crystal.
Experimentally, however, it has been established that the Berry curvature does
not play any role in the Hall resistance of the ferromagnet URhGe. URhGe is so
called altermagnetic ferromagnet which crystal symmetry includes operation of
time inversion only in combination with rotations and reflections. The
explanation for strictly zero Berry curvature of electronic states in this
material lies in the non-symmorphic symmetry of its crystal lattice.

external electric fields. We develop a theoretical and numerical frame-work
that reveals how electric fields affect intercondensate tunneling, phase
dynamics, and collective excitations. By employing a coupled set of
Gross-Pitaevskii equations with adiabatic elimination of excited states, we
demonstrate field-induced tuning of Josephson frequencies and a transition from
contact to dipole-dominated regimes. These findings corroborate theoretical
predictions about the sensitivity of dipolar BECs to external fields and deepen
our understanding of quantum coherence and tunneling in long-range interacting
quantum systems.

Method: The authors use numerical optimization to derive superoscillatory spatial regions within a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential. They focus on Bose-Einstein condensate atoms in blue-detuned lattices.

Result: Superoscillations create sub-wavelength confinement, allowing for multiple density peaks spaced below the wavelength of the lattice. It establishes superoscillations as a viable method.

Conclusion: Sub-wavelength confinement using superoscillations is effective for blue-detuned optical lattices, opening new possibilities in ultra-cold atom physics.

Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we
demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in
these lattices through \textit{superoscillations}. This generic wave phenomenon
occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the
frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how
sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a
one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless
Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the
relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it
is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain
multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes
superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in
blue-detuned optical lattices.

Method: 采用了多段电场调制的多频RF亚子午线枪，通过不同的设计结构（-standing wave 和 traveling wave）来生成理想的电子束。研究了两种具体实现——standing wave 和 traveling wave 结构。结果显示，traveling wave 版本在电功耗上有显著的降低，甚至能实现 kHz 运行。结合先进的 RF 源，如 SwissFEL 的 C 带源，预计可以在 26 零斯千分秒的时程分辨率上取得理想成果。

Result: 该方法通过多段电场调整，显著优化了电子束的生成效率，减少了系统尺寸和功率需求。旅行波设计在电功耗方面显著优于传统结构，可能达到 kHz 运行速度。与传统方法相比，该方法在同样分辨率下，减少了系统复杂度和功耗消耗。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种高效、低功耗的多段电场调制的 RF 亚子午线枪，为提升MeV 级高能电子衍射的时程分辨率提供了技术基础。旅行波设计在保持高效率的同时，显著延长了系统的使用寿命和性能表现，展现了巨大的发展潜力。该技术将极大地提升实验精度，为相关领域的研究提供强大的硬件支持。

Abstract: The temporal resolution of MeV ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is
fundamentally constrained by the electron bunch length at the sample,
motivating the development of new electron sources capable of producing
femtosecond scale bunches. In this work, we propose a multicell RF photogun
that has a tailored phase velocity profile to generate 5 to 15 fs rms MeV
electron bunches directly from the electron gun, eliminating the need for
downstream compression. This approach achieves comparable performance to
conventional one and a half cell photoguns with downstream compression, while
reducing system size, complexity, and power requirements. We examine two
implementations: a standing wave (SW) and a travelling wave (TW) design. The TW
variant demonstrates over an order of magnitude lower power dissipation than
typical SW structures, enabling potential kHz operation. When paired with
SwissFEL style C band RF sources, which offer high amplitude and phase
stability, the TW photogun is projected to deliver a temporal resolution of 26
fs rms.

Abstract: We report measurements of the K$\alpha$ emission from the astrophysically
very abundant Ca XIX (He-like ion) and its satellite lines resonantly excited
by dielectronic recombination (DR). We achieve an electron-energy resolution of
8 eV in a cryogenic electron beam ion trap, and determine the energies of the
exciting electrons and the emitted photons up to the KLn ($n\le 8$) manifold
with $0.05\%$ and $0.1\%$ respective uncertainties. For the KLL satellites,
energies agree very well with our predictions using the Flexible Atomic Code
(FAC) and previous state-of-the-art calculations. Our calculations also agree
with our experimental direct excitation cross-sections for K$\alpha$ within
their $10\%$ uncertainty. We extract DR coefficient rates and find good
agreement with values tabulated in the OPEN-ADAS database. As an application,
we experimentally benchmark Ca XIX atomic data used to model high-temperature
astrophysical plasmas by comparing FAC synthetic spectra with recent XRISM
observations revealing the contributions of DR satellites to the Ca XIX lines.

Scientists are likely concerned about maintaining the integrity and functionality of the LHC given the technology involved. The paper addresses potential challenges and ensures feasible execution. 

Method: The paper outlines specific engineering solutions like structural modifications, radiation shielding, access systems, elevator design, and cost estimation. It uses these to propose a method within 1.5 years, validating the plan's feasibility. 

Result: The conclusion is that implementing the modifications is feasible without hindering LHC operations, allowing Atom Interferometer and HL-LHC to operate smoothly. 

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that modifying the PX46 shaft can support installation of the Atom Interferometer during Run 4. The technical challenges were met with established solutions. All required modifications are possible within a 1.5-year timeframe.

Abstract: Building on the feasibility study in CERN-PBC Report-2018-002 (Arduini et al.
2018), this report supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group
describes the technical implementation of modifications to the PX46 shaft at
LHC Point 4 during LS3 (June 2026 - June 2030) that would enable it to
accommodate the installation and operation of a vertical long-baseline Atom
Interferometer during Run 4 without affecting LHC operations. We specify in
detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation
shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design
of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment
identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined
cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval,
all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window. These preparations
would ensure seamless, concurrent operation of the Atom Interferometer
experiment and the HL-LHC, with all technical challenges successfully addressed
through established engineering solutions.
