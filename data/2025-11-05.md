Motivation: 探索多频驱动对非线性系统的影响

Method: 通过双频 exciting的Duffing振子的研究

Result: 识别两个驱动力之间的竞争关系

Conclusion: 提供了控制和 manipulate非线性驱动系统的框架

Abstract: The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich
dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator
under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives,
governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime,
where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation
that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states.
We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the
resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude
ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning
in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the
resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our
results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling
state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting
circuit platforms.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解 Majorana 零模式提供了新的理论框架和实验标准，有助于实现可靠的量子计算平台。

Abstract: The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode
(MZM)-supporting nanoscale devices is determined by the time taken for
electrons to traverse the device. We employ the time-dependent
Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker transport theory for current cross-lead correlations in a
superconducting nanowire junction hosting MZMs. From the time-dependent quantum
noise, we are able to extract traversal times for electrons crossing the
system. After demonstrating a linear scaling of traversal times with nanowire
length, we present a heuristic formula for the traversal times which accurately
captures their behaviour. We then connect our framework to a proposed
experimental verification of this discriminant between spurious and genuine
MZMs utilizing time-resolved transport measurements.

Result: 实验结果表明， within 最优自旋极化角度范围内， Skyrmion 流可以实现无确定性创建、无需精确控制和检测的逻辑操作，显著简化了 Skyrmion 逻辑的实现难度。

Conclusion: 该研究发现磁性 Skyrmion 的环流具有潜在的自旋电子学和微流体应用，为 Skyrmion 基础逻辑运算和复杂函数开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Particle-like chiral magnetic skyrmions can flow in nanotracks and behave
like chiral fluids. Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an
important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic
nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing
in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors
could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls
the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of
the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to
fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of
skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control,
and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the
chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for
spintronic and nanofluidic functions.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional
length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few
geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be
defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the
choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they
cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we
introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat
band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to
the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic
localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the
Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent
observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in
a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling
limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for
many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm
all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between
$\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results
highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open
a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting
flat-band materials.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Orbital currents provide a new degree of freedom for controlling magnetism,
yet their interaction with lattice dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we
report a systematic investigation of the acoustic orbital Hall effect in light
metals such as Ti and Cr, where surface acoustic waves generate orbital
currents through phonon-orbital coupling. The acoustic orbital current in Ti
exhibits higher efficiency and longer diffusion length compared to the acoustic
spin current in Pt. The sign and magnitude of the rectified acoustic voltages
in nonmagnetic (Ti, Cr)/ferromagnetic (Ni, Co, Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$) bilayers are
determined by the product of orbital-to-spin conversion and magnetoelastic
coupling efficiencies of the ferromagnet. Additionally, we find evidence for
acoustic orbital pumping, whereby the excitation of ferromagnetic resonance by
surface acoustic waves injects an orbital current from the ferromagnet into the
nonmagnet. These results establish lattice dynamics as an efficient driver of
orbital transport, opening opportunities for low-dissipation orbitronic devices
that harness and sense phonons.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their
cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit driven by either a
voltage bias or a temperature gradient applied across the weak link. The ratios
of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit
oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the
thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven
electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $\Delta T$ vary with $N$ in a
manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance
$G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between
electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above
noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals
non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while their oscillations with gate voltage reflect
the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric
transport. Our results demonstrate that the fundamental relations linking
voltage- and temperature-induced noises to thermoelectric transport across a
tunnel junction persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm.

Abstract: The linear absorption spectrum of excitons in TMDC monolayers under the
influence of an in-plane magnetic field is theoretically studied. We
demonstrate that in-plane magnetic fields induce a hybridization between
spin-bright and spin-dark exciton transitions, resulting in a brightening of
spin-dark excitons. We analytically investigate spectral features including
resonance energy shifts, broadening and amplitudes ratios. In particular, for a
MoSe$_2$ monolayer with radiatively-limited linewidth, we find a complex
interplay of dark-bright splitting and linewidth difference of both involved
spin-bright and spin-dark excitons.

Abstract: This work presents a fully theoretical and self consistent framework for
calculating the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of CdSe/ZnS--MOF composite
quantum dots. The approach unifies finite-potential quantum confinement,the
Liouville von Neumann density matrix expansion to third order, and
effective-medium electrodynamics (Maxwell--Garnett and Bruggeman) within a
single Hamiltonian-based model, requiring no empirical fitting. Electron hole
quantized states and dipole matrix elements are obtained under the
effective-mass approximation with BenDaniel--Duke boundary conditions; closed
analytic forms for(including Lorentzian/Voigt broadening) follow from the
response expansion. Homogenization yields macroscopic scaling laws that link
microscopic descriptors (core radius, shell thickness, dielectric mismatch) to
bulk coefficients and. A Kramers--Kronig consistency check confirms causality
and analyticity of the computed spectra with small residuals. The formalism
provides a predictive, parameter-transparent route to engineer third-order
nonlinearity in hybrid quantum materials,clarifying how size and environment

Conclusion: 该研究为分析薄金属体中Weyl点附近的能带提供了简洁且有效的工具，消除了对复杂色散计算的依赖。

Abstract: We propose a four-bands model describing the electron energy spectra near the
Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs,
NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from
the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of
these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this
model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine
their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for
dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl
points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values
of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results
show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum
in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex
band-structure calculations.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses minimal models of all Néel ordered collinear antiferromagnets showing the anomalous Hall effect, considering two-dimensional antiferromagnetic models with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. The authors analyze the existence of magnetization in Néel ordered antiferromagnets using Turov's invariants and derive the mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect as the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the Néel order and spin-orbit coupling consistent with the broken symmetries that allowed for Turov's invariant in the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a well-known phenomenon in condensed matter physics, and its occurrence in antiferromagnets is not yet fully understood. This paper aims to provide a theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which the AHE can occur in such systems and to identify the mechanisms responsible for it.

Method: The authors propose and theoretically study minimal models of Néel ordered collinear antiferromagnets. They construct two-dimensional models with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice and analyze the Turov's invariants for proposed systems. They derive the mechanism of the AHE by considering the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interactions and spin-orbit coupling.

Result: The authors find that the AHE is allowed only for certain directions of the Néel order defined by the crystal lattice symmetries. They also identify the mechanism of the AHE as the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the Néel order and spin-orbit coupling consistent with the broken symmetries that allowed for Turov's invariant in the system.

Conclusion: This paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which the AHE can occur in Néel ordered collinear antiferromagnets and identifies the mechanism responsible for it as the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interactions and spin-orbit coupling under specific crystal lattice symmetries.

Abstract: In this paper we propose and theoretically study minimal models of all
N\'{e}el ordered collinear antiferromagnets which show the anomalous Hall
effect. For simplicity we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets
with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. Examples of N\'{e}el ordered
ferrimagnet and of Dzyaloshinskii's weak ferromagnet are given. Turov's
invariants of existence of the magnetization in N\'{e}el ordered
antiferromagnets for proposed systems are analyzed. As a result, we obtain that
the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for certain directions of the
N\'{e}el order defined by the crystal lattice symmetries. We derive the
mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets to be the interplay
of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the
N\'{e}el order, and the spin-orbit coupling consistent with the broken
symmetries that allowed for the Turov's invariant in the system.

Abstract: The graphene-insulator-semiconductor-structured electron source has garnered
significant attention due to its high electron emission efficiency and highly
monochromatic electron emission. Graphene, with its c-axis orientation and
well-defined interlayer spacing, exhibits electron interference effects that
can influence the properties of emitted electrons. In this work, motion of an
electron wave packet is numerically calculated to discuss the energy spread of
the zero-order and first-order diffracted electron waves by mono- and
multilayer graphene. It is found that the effects of multiple reflections of
electron between the layers broaden the energy spread especially for the
incident energy of 13.4 eV, and that highly monochromatic electron emission can
be achieved by using diffracted electron wave with a small aperture.

Abstract: This paper explores the implementation of a low-cost high-precision microwave
oscillator sensor with an adjustable input resistance to enhance its limit of
detection (LoD). To achieve this, we introduce a \textit{Z$_{2}$} branch in the
input network, comprising a transmission line, a capacitor (\textit{C$_{B}$})
and a resistor (\textit{R$_{V}$}). The sensor is tested with eight different
liquids with different dielectric constants, including water, IV fluid, milk,
ethanol, acetone, petrol, olive oil, and Vaseline. By fine-tuning the
\textit{Z$_{2}$} branch, a clear relationship is found between
$\varepsilon_{r}$ of materials and R$_{V}$.Our experimental results demonstrate
outstanding characteristics, including remarkable linearity (nonlinearity <
2.44\%), high accuracy with an average sensitivity of 21 kHz/$\mu$m, and an
excellent limit of detection (LoD < 0.05 mm). The sensor also exhibits good
stability across a range of liquid temperatures and shows robust and repeatable
behavior. Considering the strong absorption of microwave energy in liquids with
high dielectric constants, this oscillator sensor is a superior choice over
capacitive sensors for such applications. We validate the performance of the
oscillator sensor using water as a representative liquid. Additionally, we
substantiate the sensor's improvement through both experimental results and
theoretical analysis. Its advantages, including affordability, compatibility
with CMOS and MEMS technologies, and ease of fabrication, make it an excellent
choice for small-scale liquid detection applications.

Abstract: We investigate traversable wormholes in squared-trace extended gravity within
the framework of Finsler-Randers geometry equipped with the Barthel connection.
The Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by terms involving the trace of the
energy-momentum tensor and its square, generating effective anisotropies
through matter-curvature coupling. The resulting field equations are studied
under barotropic equations of state with exponential and power-law shape
functions. Finslerian anisotropy introduces novel pressure dynamics that enable
the classical energy conditions to be satisfied in specific parameter domains.
Our analysis shows that the Barthel connection significantly extends the
parameter space for non-exotic, physically viable wormholes compared to purely
Riemannian models. These findings suggest that Finslerian modifications provide
a powerful mechanism for realizing realistic wormhole structures, offering new
perspectives on anisotropic and geometrically enriched space-time
configurations in extended gravity.

Conclusion: 抛物线引力波相遇具有独特的挑战和特性，为非零记忆二体演化提供了研究基础。

Abstract: The memory effect is known to introduce a permanent displacement in the
gravitational wave (GW) detectors after the passage of a GW signal. While the
linear memory adheres to the source properties, the non-linear memory is a
secondary effect sourced by the GW itself. In the present work, we discuss GW
signals with both these kinds of memory effects, while focusing on the
parabolic limit of an encounter. This special case is theoretically intriguing
and emerges as a limiting situation for both eccentric and hyperbolic events.
However, in this paper, we argue that a simple extrapolation of memory
calculations for eccentric or hyperbolic cases to the parabolic case may lead
to incorrect estimations. Therefore, we treat the parabola as a special case
and use an intrinsic parameterization, with which we calculate gravitational
wave signals and their energy spectrum via an effective field theory formalism.
Unlike the hyperbolic case, which is known to have linear memory, we notice
that parabolic encounters bring out new features in the zero frequency limit
(ZFL). Our work highlights some of the key challenges and salient aspects of
these encounters, and paves the way to study such binary evolution with nonzero
memory.

### [16] [Quasi-normal modes ratios as agnostic test of general relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02010)
*Nicola Franchini*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We provide a new method to test general relativity using ringdown analysis of black hole mergers, identifying unique mode characteristics that differ from alternative theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing general relativity (GR) is crucial for understanding gravity and alternative theories. This method offers a new way to validate GR through black hole signals.

Method: We developed a test using ringdown signals from black hole mergers by fitting them with damped sinusoids. The analysis focuses on mode frequency ratios and damping times, comparing them to GR predictions.

Result: The frequency ratios and damping times are primarily influenced by spin and mode properties. These ratios align well with GR predictions, with minimal deviations for alternative theories.

Conclusion: This method effectively distinguishes between GR and alternative gravity theories by analyzing specific mode characteristics in ringdown signals.

Abstract: In this letter, we provide a novel test of general relativity based on
ringdown analysis. The test is performed on agnostic models, where the
postmerger signal is fitted with a superposition of damped sinusoids. If at
least two modes are detected, one has to compute the ratio of the frequencies
and of the damping times and compare them against the predictions of general
relativity. By considering ratios, the dependency on the black hole's mass is
scaled away. Most notably, we find that the ratios vary very little with the
spin, the real part depends mostly on the angular momentum of the mode $\ell$
and the imaginary part depends mostly on the overtone number $n$: different
combinations create specific mode islands. We provide a qualitative explanation

### [17] [Testing Quantum Gravity with Gravitational Waves from the ringdown of binary Black Holes coalescences: A New Frontier in Fundamental Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02056)
*Marco Danilo Claudio Torri,Fulvio Ricci,Marco Giammarchi,Lino Miramonti,Valerio Toso,Chiara Sigala*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational wave observations of merging compact objects offer a new avenue to study fundamental physics, particularly General Relativity and quantum gravity. The detection of ringdown emission from black hole mergers could provide insights into spacetime structure near event horizons, black hole properties, and quantum gravity models like loop quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gravitational waves in the strong field regime and their implications for quantum gravity is a fundamental goal in theoretical physics. The detection of such waves, especially from ringdown emission, could revolutionize our understanding of spacetime and black holes.

Method: Mathematical analysis of waveforms from gravitational wave observations, focusing on the ringdown phase after binary black hole mergers. Involves modeling ringdown emission using quasi-normal modes and comparing theoretical predictions with data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer.

Result: The method proposes a framework for extracting ringdown parameters, including quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, which could be used to infer physical properties of black holes such as mass, spin, and horizon area. The results also aim to constrain quantum gravity models by analyzing the quantization of black hole entropy.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave observations, especially focusing on ringdown emission from black hole mergers, provide a powerful tool to test quantum gravity theories and enhance our understanding of spacetime structure near black hole horizons.

Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of
compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in
fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General
Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field
regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the
detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow
the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also
providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also
opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models
regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the
quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future,
the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration
will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as
the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great
interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for
investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the
special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black
hole systems.

are cross-validated with the two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method,
demonstrating excellent agreement and ensuring self-consistency. This work
establishes a robust foundation for a theory-agnostic interpretation of
gravitational-wave ringdown signals, providing a practical tool for probing
potential deviations from General Relativity in the strong-field regime.

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are often surrounded by dark matter, which can

Schwarzschild-like black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter
halo and analyse scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in

investigate particle motion and photon trajectories, and use black hole shadow
observations to place constraints on the halo parameters. We further examine
the greybody factors associated with Hawking radiation for different

Abstract: Dynamical Love numbers capture the conservative response of an object to a
time-dependent external tidal gravitational field. We compute the dynamical
Love numbers of Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity within a
point-particle effective field theory framework. In addition to the known
logarithmic running, we compute the finite scheme-dependent contributions to
the Love number couplings. We do this by matching the renormalized one-point
function in the effective theory to the classical field profile computed in
general relativity. On the general relativity side, we solve the Regge-Wheeler
and Zerilli equations perturbatively in a small frequency expansion. In order
to match on the effective field theory side we include gravitational
interactions using the Born series and employ dimensional regularization to
obtain a renormalized field profile.

Result: 随着 $l$ 增大，$r_{+}$、$r_{	ext{ph}}$、$b_{c}$ 和 $r_{	ext{ISCO}}$ 逐渐减小，而 $r_{-}$ 和 $	ext{QNMs}$ 实频 $	ext{ }	ext{ }	ext{}	ext{ }	ext{}	ext{}	ext{ }	ext{ }$则增大。随着 $a$ 增大，前几项反而数值增大，且实现虚频绝对值减小。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解正则黑洞与弦云之间的物理耦合关系提供了重要的理论依据。

Abstract: In this work, we explored the Hayward black hole surrounded by a cloud of
strings, with a focus on the effects of the regularization parameter $l$ and
the string cloud parameter $a$ on its observational properties and quasinormal
modes (QNMs). Utilizing the spacetime metric and geodesic equations, we
calculated several geometric quantities characterizing the black hole. To
visualize the observational appearance of the accretion disk, we employed the
Novikov--Thorne model to simulate both its primary and secondary images.
Furthermore, we analyzed the QNMs of the black hole under scalar and
electromagnetic perturbations for different parameter values. The results
indicate that as the regularization parameter $l$ increases, the outer horizon
radius $r_{+}$, photon-sphere radius $r_{\text{ph}}$, critical impact parameter
$b_{c}$, and innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\text{isco}}$ exhibit a
gradual decrease, while the inner horizon radius $r_{-}$ and the real part of
the QNMs frequency $\omega_{r}$ increase. In contrast, as the string cloud
parameter $a$ increases, $r_{+}$, $r_{\text{ph}}$, $b_{c}$, and $r_{\text{
isco}}$ demonstrate a rapid increase, whereas $r_{-}$ and $\omega_{r}$
decrease. In both cases, the absolute value of the imaginary part of the QNMs
frequency decreases with the increase $l$ or $a$. This work offers a
theoretical foundation for understanding the coupling between regular black
holes and surrounding string clouds.

Abstract: We present a thermodynamic analysis of spherically symmetric gravitational
collapse. Using the Hayward-Kodama formalism, we treat a collapsing sphere as a
thermodynamic system and express the surface gravity $\kappa_{hk}$ in terms of
the geometric variables. We derive the specific heat capacities and identify a
critical condition $\dot{\kappa}_{hk} = 0$ as the locus of second order phase
transition during the collapse. Through specific examples, we demonstrate that
the condition is independent of singular/non-singular nature of the geometry.
We also find that the critical condition of phase transition is equivalent to a
stationary condition of the expansion of null congruence. This establishes a
direct correspondence between geometric stability and thermodynamic
criticality, allowing the identification of apparent horizon as a universal
critical surface in the phase-space of gravitational collapse.

Conclusion: 奇点结构在经典广相中是可局部化的，可以通过一系列更小的区域来覆盖，并且这些区域的直径在某种自然距离下趋向于零。因此，奇点结构不是一种全局性质，而是可以通过局部性质来描述。

Abstract: We prove that every open connected region of relativistic spacetime
$(M,\textbf{g})$ that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve has an open
connected subregion that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve and is also
'small' in the following sense: it is the image, under the bundle projection
map, of some open region in the (connected) orthonormal frame bundle $O^+M$
over that spacetime which is bounded, and whose closure is Cauchy incomplete,
with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$. As a corollary, it
follows that every $b$-incomplete half-curve can be covered by a sequence of
singular regions which are images of a sequence of bounded subsets of $O^+M$
whose diameter, with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$,
tends to zero. We discuss to what extent these results can be interpreted in
favour of the claim that singular structure in classical general relativity is
'localizable'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: GW231123 is a short-duration, low-frequency gravitational wave signal
consistent with a binary black hole coalescence and dominated by the
merger-ringdown regime due to the high mass of the source. We demonstrate that
fits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically
preferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also
find that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with
those of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits
struggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by
labeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr
prograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with
the ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the
data better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When
fitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the
inclusion of a third mode, an ${(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone,
improves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of
general relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency
spectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency
and damping rate spectrum to within $\pm10\%$ at the 90$\%$ credible level
using a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\pm8\%$ constraints using a
model with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain.
Understanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate
analyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary
formation studies -- our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher
remnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models
including NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have
astrophysical implications.

Conclusion: 动态分析方法有效地研究了不同 Quintessence 模型，揭示了其关系和属性，为解决初步数据和近似方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent observations suggest that the accelerated expansion of the Universe at
late times is caused by a temporally changing dark energy component, rather
than the constant one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. In this context
quintessence, i.e. a canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, plays
a prominent role. There are, however, three main types of quintessence models:
thawing quintessence, scaling freezing quintessence, and tracking quintessence.
Dynamical systems reformulations of the field equations for a broad set of
scalar field potentials, including some new ones, allow us to use dynamical
systems methods to derive global and asymptotic features, visualised in bounded
state space pictures clearly illustrating the relationships and properties of
the different types of quintessence, clarifying initial data issues, and
yielding simple and accurate approximations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from
the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an
$(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our
analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric
function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$
and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the
conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of
conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models
obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the
presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The
generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the
Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a
specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the
conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is
determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free
parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological
models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic
Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of
$\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is
also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating
Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple,
alternative to standard cosmological models.

Conclusion: 量子后向反应可能导致多层视界形成，并由此提供量子引力的分立机制

Abstract: When Hawking radiation from a rotating or non-rotating black hole becomes
sufficiently intense, its own stress energy can no longer be treated as a
perturbation on a fixed background. In this regime the outgoing flux may
generate an additional, transient trapping surf ace exterior to the original
event horizon. Using a simple spherically symmetric semi classical model we
demonstrate that strong outgoing null energy can create nested apparent
horizons, a feature reminiscent of the Penrose process but mediated by quantum
back reaction. The effect is illustrated using a smooth Vaidya type mass
profile, and conditions for bifurcation and merger of horizons are derived. We
further propose that the separation between nested horizons may obey a discrete
quantization rule analogous to the Bohr Sommerfeld condition,suggesting a
geometric route toward quantum-gravity discreteness.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of accurate position reconstruction in noble-element TPCs, which is crucial for rare-event searches in astroparticle physics. The authors propose a novel physics-informed continuous normalizing flow that significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving superior reconstruction accuracy with fewer calibration events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accurate reconstruction of particle positions in Time-Projection Chambers (TPCs) is essential for detecting faint astrophysical signals. However, distortions caused by electric fields limit the precision of these measurements. This paper aims to overcome such limitations by introducing a new method that leverages the physics of the system.

Method: The authors propose a physics-informed continuous normalizing flow. This architecture learns the electric field transformations directly from calibration data, while enforcing field conservativity through the model structure. They apply this method to simulated data from an XLZD-like dual-phase xenon TPC.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly better reconstruction accuracy compared to histogram-based correction methods, even when trained on the same datasets. Importantly, it requires only $6 	imes 10^5$ calibration events, which is an order of magnitude fewer than traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This advancement paves the way for practical field monitoring, propagation of position uncertainties, and enhanced background discrimination in future rare-event searches.

Abstract: Accurate position reconstruction in noble-element time-projection chambers
(TPCs) is critical for rare-event searches in astroparticle physics, yet is
systematically limited by electric field distortions arising from charge
accumulation on detector surfaces. Conventional data-driven field corrections
suffer from three fundamental limitations: discretization artifacts that break
smoothness and differentiability, lack of guaranteed consistency with Maxwell's
equations, and statistical requirements of $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ calibration
events. We introduce a physics-informed continuous normalizing flow
architecture that learns the electric field transformation directly from
calibration data while enforcing the constraint of field conservativity through
the model structure itself. Applied to simulated $^{83\mathrm{m}}$Kr
calibration data in an XLZD-like dual-phase xenon TPC, our method achieves
superior reconstruction accuracy compared to histogram-based corrections when
trained on identical datasets, demonstrating viable performance with only
$6\times10^5$ events$\unicode{x2013}$an order of magnitude reduction in
calibration requirements. This approach enables practical monthly field
monitoring campaigns, propagation of position uncertainties through
differentiable transformations, and enhanced background discrimination in
next-generation rare-event searches.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of high-speed data processing in particle physics, particularly in detecting anomalies using neural networks, with the goal of achieving faster and more efficient inference on particle physics detectors.

Method: The authors developed a novel approach called Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Neural Networks (CLGN) based on differentiable logic gates. They also synthesized an Logic Gate Network (LGN) optimized for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These methods were applied to a public dataset from the CICADA project.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of logic gate networks for high-speed, on-detector inference in High Energy Physics and suggests broader applications beyond this specific domain.

Abstract: The increasing data rates and complexity of detectors at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) necessitate fast and efficient machine learning models,
particularly for rapid selection of what data to store, known as triggering.
Building on recent work in differentiable logic gates, we present a public
implementation of a Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Neural Network
(CLGN). We apply this to detecting anomalies at the Level-1 Trigger at CMS
using public data from the CICADA project. We demonstrate that the CLGN
achieves physics performance on par with or superior to conventional quantized
neural networks. We also synthesize an LGN for a Field-Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) and show highly promising FPGA characteristics, notably zero Digital
Signal Processor (DSP) resource usage. This work highlights the potential of
logic gate networks for high-speed, on-detector inference in High Energy
Physics and beyond.

Motivation:  addresses challenges in detecting rare decay processes in nuclear physics, with potential implications for understanding neutrino properties.

Method: combines hybrid and opaque scintillation technology with novel light read-out methods.

Result:  aims to discover two-neutrino double beta plus decay within 1 tonne-week; plans to achieve several orders of magnitude improvement in significance for neutrinoless double beta plus decays.

Conclusion: presents a novel detector concept, NuDoubt++, optimized for detecting these rare decay processes with enhanced sensitivity.

Abstract: Double beta plus decay is a rare nuclear disintegration process. Difficulties
in its measurement arise from suppressed decay probabilities, experimentally
challenging decay signatures and low natural abundances of suitable candidate
nuclei. In this presentation, we propose NuDoubt++, a new detector concept to
overcome these challenges. It is based on the first-time combination of hybrid
and opaque scintillation detector technology paired with novel light read-out
techniques. This approach is particularly suitable detecting positron (beta
plus) signatures. We expect to discover two-neutrino double beta plus decay
modes within 1 tonne-week exposure and are able to probe neutrinoless double
beta plus decays at several orders of magnitude improved significance compared
to current experimental limits.

Abstract: NEXT-100 is a high-pressure xenon time projection chamber with
electroluminescent amplification, designed to operate with up to approximately
70.5 kg at 13.5 bar. It is the most recent detector developed by the NEXT
collaboration to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay ($\beta\beta
0\nu$) of Xe-136. The NEXT gas TPC technology offers the best energy resolution
near the Q-value of the decay ($Q_{\beta\beta}$ = 2458 keV) among xenon
detectors, which is set by design to be <1% FWHM. We report here the
high-energy calibration of the detector using a Th-228 source, demonstrating
linear response and an energy resolution of $(0.90 \pm 0.02)$% FWHM at the
Tl-208 photopeak (2615 keV). This performance extrapolates to a resolution at
the double-beta decay end-point of $R(Q_{\beta\beta})$ = $(0.93 \pm 0.02)$%
FWHM, confirming the detector's capability for precision energy measurement in
the search for $\beta\beta 0\nu$.

Abstract: The T-REX neutron time-of-flight spectrometer at the European Spallation

Al blades of the grids to detect scattered thermal neutrons. Following a Monte
Carlo study of internal shielding to suppress neutron multiple scattering in
T-REX, the neutron transmission and scattering properties of 12
shielding-material samples have been measured at the ISIS spallation neutron
source. Neutron transmission was measured on the EMMA beam line at wavelengths
0.5-4.7 A, using a 2D-position-sensitive, neutron GEM detector, while neutron
scattering was measured for 6 of the samples at the Merlin spectrometer, at
wavelengths 0.72, 1.28, 1.85 and 2.41 A. The present tests show that a B4C/Al
composite material, plated with Ni to stop intrinsic alpha background, is an
effective neutron absorber, suitable for incorporation in the Multi-Grid

TL;DR: A new 3D pulse shape simulation method for p-type HPGe detectors was developed to improve background event suppression in low-background experiments. The method addresses the challenge of reduced charge collection in the surface layer, enabling more accurate simulation and identification of background events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to suppress background events in low-background experiments, particularly for rare physics processes like dark matter detection and neutrinoless double-beta decay, drives the development of improved simulation methods for p-type HPGe detectors.

Method: A novel three-dimensional pulse shape simulation method was implemented for the reduced charge collection (RCC) layer in p-type HPGe detectors using the open-source tool SolidStateDetectors.jl. The method integrates with analytical calculations and experimental validation to validate the simulation accuracy.

Result: The numerical simulation results were validated against analytical calculations, and experimental studies with a p-type HPGe detector confirmed the method's effectiveness in suppressing background events.

Conclusion: The developed simulation method enhances the capability of p-type HPGe detectors to suppress background events, offering a versatile solution adaptable to other semiconductor materials.

Abstract: $P$-type high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors are widely used across many
scientific domains, and current data analysis methods have served well in many
use cases. However, applications like low-background experiments that search
for rare physics, such as dark matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and
coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, could profit a lot from a more
detailed understanding of the detector response close to the surface. The outer
$n^+$ electrode of the $p$-type HPGe detector forms a layer with reduced charge
collection, and events originating here can be a critical background source in
such experiments. If the difference in detector pulse shape between detector
surface and bulk events is known, it can be used to identify and veto these
background events. However, a faithful simulation of the detector response in
this surface region is difficult and has not been available as a standard
method so far. We present a novel three-dimensional pulse shape simulation
method for this reduced charge collection (RCC) layer. We have implemented this
method as a new feature in the open-source simulation package
\emph{SolidStateDetectors.jl} and show a validation of the numerical simulation
results with analytical calculations. An experimental study using a $p$-type
HPGe detector also validates our approach. The current implementation supports
$p$-type HPGe detectors of fairly arbitrary geometry, but is easily adaptable
to $n$-type detectors by adjusting the impurity density profile of the layer.
It should also be adaptable to other semiconductor materials in a
straightforward fashion.

Abstract: This work presents the results of a time-based event selection for searching
X-ray signals from kaonic atom X-ray transition using a single
quasi-hemispherical Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) detector at the DA$\Phi$NE
collider. To mitigate the high background level in the measured X-ray spectrum,
a dedicated event selection strategy was developed, exploiting the precise
timing correlation between e+e- collisions and detector signals. This approach
enabled, for the first time, the observation of two characteristic X-ray
transitions from kaonic aluminum atoms using a CZT detector: for the 5-4
transition at 50~keV, 362~$\pm$~41~(stat.)~$\pm$~20~(sys.) signal events over
1698~$\pm$~197~(stat.)~$\pm$~25~(sys.) background events in 5$\sigma$ were
observed, with a resolution of 9.2\%~FWHM; for the 4-3 transition at 106~keV,
295~$\pm$~50~(stat.)~$\pm$~20~(sys.) signal events over
2939~$\pm$~500~(stat.)~$\pm$~16~(sys.) background events in 5$\sigma$ were
measured, with a resolution of 6.6 ~FWHM. A strong background suppression of
approximately 95\% of the triggered data was achieved through this time-based
selection. The demonstrated timing capability of the CZT detector proved highly
effective in isolating time-correlated events within an 80 ns window, setting
an important benchmark for the application of these semiconductors in
timing-based X-ray spectroscopy. These results highlight the potential of
CZT-based detection systems for future precision measurements in high-radiation
environments, paving the way for compact, room-temperature X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray spectrometers in fundamental physics and beyond.

### [41] [Quasi-Solid and Supersolid from Quasiperiodic Long-Range Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02218)
*Chao Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: Investigates one-dimensional hard-core bosons with quasiperiodic interactions, discovering incompressible density plateaus at incommensurate fillings related to Fibonacci ratios. The plateaus exhibit nonuniform density profiles and long-range correlations, supported by the structure factor. The system can exist in three phases: a quasi-solid without superfluidity, a quasi-supersolid with coexisting density order and superfluid density, or a superfluid with full superfluidity. Notably, the quasiperiodicity induced by the interaction alone stabilizes novel quantum phases that break translational symmetry while maintaining quantum coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research explores the impact of quasiperiodic interactions on quantum phases, inspired by the rich physics of quasiperiodic systems and their potential for stabilizing novel quantum phases.

Method: Large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations are employed to analyze the system's properties, capturing phenomena such as incompressible density plateaus, nonuniform density profiles, and long-range correlations.

Result: The study finds that quasiperiodic interactions alone can stabilize distinct quantum phases, including a quasi-solid, a quasi-supersolid, and a superfluid, each with distinct characteristics regarding density order, superfluidity, and symmetry breaking.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for understanding quasiperiodic quantum systems and highlights the potential for purely interaction-driven quasiperiodicity to stabilize novel quantum phases with unique properties.

Abstract: We investigate hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic
long-range interactions defined by V_ij = V0 cos(pi * alpha * i) cos(pi * alpha
* j), where alpha = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Large-scale
quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal incompressible density plateaus at
incommensurate fillings tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus feature
emergent nonuniform density profiles and robust long-range correlations, as
captured by the structure factor. Depending on filling and interaction
strength, the system realizes either a quasi-solid phase with suppressed
superfluidity, a quasi-supersolid phase where density order coexists with
finite superfluid density, or a superfluid phase. Our results demonstrate that
purely interaction-induced quasiperiodicity, without external potential or
disorder, can stabilize novel quantum phases that simultaneously break
translational symmetry and sustain quantum coherence.

Abstract: When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can
sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may
still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such
constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where
single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while
preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the
particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold
bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations
consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and
characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a
bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves
the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing
experimental platforms.

Abstract: Quantum droplets (QDs), formed by ultra-dilute quantum fluids under the
action of Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) effect, provide a unique platform for
investigating a wide range of macroscopic quantum effects. Recent studies of
QDs' breathing modes and collisional dynamics have revealed their
compressibility and extensibility, which suggests that their elasticity
parameters can be identified. In this work, we derive the elastic bulk modulus
(BM) of QDs by means of the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, and
establish a relation between the BM and the eigenfrequency of QD's intrinsic
vibrations. The analysis reveals the dependence of the QD's elasticity on the
particle number and the strength of interparticle interactions. We conclude
that the BM of QDs can be less than $1~\mathrm{\mu Pa}$, implying that QDs are
ultra-soft quantum elastic media. These findings suggest new perspectives for
realizing elastic media governed by the LHY effect.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium pattern formation in an antiparallel
two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate by varying the polarization
angle and the trap aspect ratio. At finite tilt, the condensate supports stripe
order. Quenching the angle to zero triggers a roton-assisted, mushroom-like
corrugation that destroys translational order and drives the system into
labyrinthine textures, whereas a slow linear ramp produces long-lived curved
stripes that ultimately converge to labyrinths. Population imbalance strongly
biases the evolution: the minority component preferentially fragments into a
stable droplet array while the majority remains comparatively diffuse; once
formed, the droplet crystal is robust under polarization hysteresis with
largely reversible shape changes and unchanged lattice topology. The trap
aspect ratio controls both the initial stripe number and the instability
timescale, with tighter axial confinement accelerating corrugation and yielding
denser labyrinths at late times. All behaviors arise within a
quasi-two-dimensional mean-field regime where beyond-mean-field corrections are
negligible; accordingly, the droplets reported here are not self-bound in free
space. The observed textures (such as stripes, curved stripes, and labyrinths)
mirror the taxonomy and instability pathways of nuclear "pasta" morphologies
(rods and slabs) known from neutron-star and supernova matter, highlighting
polarization angle, trap geometry, and population imbalance as practical,
experimentally accessible controls for selecting and steering patterns in
dipolar mixtures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding fermionic many-body systems to observe collective quantum phenomena like macroscopic superfluidity and Cooper pairing.

Method: Coherent excitation of two counter-propagating phonons in a fermionic superfluid with controllable interactions and a sound interferometer to measure quantum circulation and thermal depletion.

Result: Superfluid circulation quantum quantized as h/(2m) quantum of circulation, differing from bosonic systems, and phonon interferometry reveals thermal depletion in the unitary Fermi gas.

Conclusion: The study bridges BEC-BCS crossover, quantum circulation quantization, and phonon interferometry as a tool in studying strongly-correlated quantum systems.

Abstract: Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how
interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as
macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the
formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as
composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike
elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by
underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid
properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly
correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical
Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across
the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently
exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular
fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency
degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon
controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring,
resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary
quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the
fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow
circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the
constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the
relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at
tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the
unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique
for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.

Abstract: The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers
beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of
quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum
technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates
observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that
preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency.
The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a
fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits
variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via
systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and
two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network
methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high
accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques
and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a
practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.

Abstract: We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion
of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's
often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps
the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our
updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures
observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional
state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context.
Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum
mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now,
in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided
no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed
inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed
values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To
ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli
settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid
criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights
the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.

Abstract: As demand for quantum technologies increases, so does the need to generate
and classify non-classical correlations in complex many-body systems. We
introduce a simple and versatile method for creating and certifying
entanglement and many-body Bell correlations. This method relies on a single
qubit interacting with an $N$-qubit system. We demonstrate that: (i) such
pairwise interaction is sufficient to induce many-body quantum correlations,
and (ii) the qubit can serve as a probe to extract all information about these
correlations. Thus, single-qubit measurements reveal multi-partite entanglement
and $N$-body Bell correlations, enabling the rapid and efficient certification
of non-classicality in complex systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 我们证明了经典和交换Pauli哈密顿量下的Gibbs态在弱局部去相干下是稳定的，即去相干的效果可以被局部逆转。我们的结论适用于有限温度平衡临界点和低温有序相态。在这些系统中， unconditional的时空相关性是长程的，局部动力学（如Metropolis）表现出临界放慢。尽管如此，我们的结果表明存在局部“解码器”逆转去相干，当去相干强度低于临界值时。这意味着热力学稳定的量子记忆在接近临界温度时仍存在非零的抗去相干阈值。类似地，在扩散模型中，数据分布的稳定性意味着在后期生成动力学中存在高效局部去噪器。

Motivation: 研究量子记忆在去相干影响下的稳定性是量子信息科学中的一个关键问题。理解量子系统在环境干扰下的行为有助于开发抗外界干扰的量子计算和量子通信技术。

Method: 我们通过分析经典和量子哈密顿量下的Gibbs态，结合局部去相干的影响，利用统计物理学和量子力学的方法，推导出Gibbs态的稳定性。

Result: 通过理论分析和数学推导，证明在弱局部去相干下，经典和交换Pauli的哈密顿量下的Gibbs态是稳定的，且存在局部去相干逆转机制。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解量子系统在去相干影响下的稳定性提供了重要依据，并为开发抗干扰的量子技术提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli,
Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the
effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our
conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered
low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal
correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits
critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local
"decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a
critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable
quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as
one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models,
stability of data distributions implies the existence of
computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.

Motivation: Trapped ion-based quantum computers are difficult to scale because state preparation is time-consuming. The proposed 

Method: Our new approach, 

Result: This method can increase the generation rate of remote entanglement to over 1,000 Bell pairs per second, reducing the time- and energy-intensive state preparation.

Conclusion: This method provides a significant advancement for scaling up atomic-based quantum computers by improving photonic interconnect efficiency.

Abstract: Photonic interconnects are a key technology for scaling up atomic based
quantum computers. By facilitating the connection of multiple systems,
high-performance modular quantum processing units may be constructed to perform
deeper and more useful algorithms. Most previous implementations of photonic
interconnects in trapped ions utilize the scheme of preparing a state, exciting
it, and collecting single photons from decays of the excited state. State
preparation is responsible for the vast majority of the total attempt time,
often taking hundreds of nanoseconds to several microseconds. Here, we describe
and analyze a novel technique called ``electron juggling" to speed up photonic
interconnects by reducing the state preparation step substantially. Using a
theoretical framework, we illustrate how this scheme can significantly increase
remote entanglement generation rates, approaching the atomic physics limit of
the attempt rate in trapped-ion photonic interconnects. Our results indicate
that this scheme holds the possibility of achieving remote entanglement
generation rates of over 1,000 Bell pairs per second.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In quantum information geometry, the curvature of von-Neumann entropy and
relative entropy induce a natural metric on the space of mixed quantum states.
Here we use this information metric to construct a random matrix ensemble for
states and investigate its key statistical properties such the eigenvalue
density and probability distribution of entropy. We present an algorithm for
generating these entropy-based random density matrices by sampling a class of
bipartite pure states, thus providing a new recipe for random state generation
that differs from the well established Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures-Hall ensemble
approaches. We find that a distinguishing feature of the ensemble is its larger
purity and increased volume towards the boundary of full-rank states. The
entropy-based ensemble can thus be used as a uninformative prior for Bayesian
quantum state tomography in high purity regimes, and as a tool for quantifying
typical entanglement in finite depth quantum circuits.

Motivation: The paper delves into the properties of quasiprobability representations, focusing on the Kirkwood-Dirac family and their uniqueness in quantum mechanics applications.

Method: The authors analyze various quasiprobability representations, establish criteria for their characterization, and prove the uniqueness of the Kirkwood-Dirac family.

Result: The study identifies specific properties of Kirkwood-Dirac representations, particularly how their conditional expectations align with optimal predictions.

Conclusion: This work offers a deeper understanding of quasiprobability representations, highlighting Kirkwood-Dirac as a unique and valuable tool in quantum mechanics applications.

Abstract: Among all possible quasiprobability representations of quantum mechanics, the
family of Kirkwood-Dirac representations has come to the foreground in recent
years because of the flexibility they offer in numerous applications. This
raises the question of their characterisation: what makes Kirkwood-Dirac
representations special among all possible choices? We show the following. For
two observables $\hat A$ and $\hat B$, consider all quasiprobability
representations of quantum mechanics defined on the joint spectrum of $\hat A$
and $\hat B$, and that have the correct marginal Born probabilities for $\hat
A$ and $\hat B$. For any such Born-compatible quasiprobability representation,
we show that there exists, for each observable $\hat{X}$, a naturally
associated conditional expectation, given $\hat B$. In addition, among the
aforementioned representations, only the Kirkwood-Dirac representation has the
following property: its associated conditional expectation of $\hat{X}$ given
$\hat{B}$ coincides with the best predictor of $\hat{X}$ by a function of $\hat
B$, for all $\hat X$.

Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond are among the leading solid state quantum
platforms, offering exceptional spatial resolution and sensitivity for
applications such as magnetic field sensing, thermometry, and bioimaging.
However, in high background environments,such as those encountered in in vitro
diagnostics, the performance of NV based sensors can be compromised by strong
background fluorescence, particularly from substrates such as nitrocellulose.
In this work, we analytically and experimentally investigate the use of pulsed
laser excitation combined with time gating techniques to suppress background
fluorescence and enhance the signal to noise ratio in NV based quantum sensing,
with an emphasis on spin enhanced biosensing. Through experimental studies
using mixed ensembles of silicon vacancy and NV centers in bulk diamond, as
well as fluorescent nanodiamonds on NC substrates, we demonstrate significant
improvements in NV spin resonance visibility, demonstrated by an increase of
the SNR by up to 4x, and a resulting measurement time reduction by 16x. The
presented technique and results here can help significantly increase the
readout efficiency and speed in future applications of NV centers in high
background environments, such as in IVD, where the NV centers are used as a
fluorescent label for biomolecules.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relation between different notions of
quantum complexity, namely, circuit and spread complexity and physically
meaningful quantities such as the particle content of the quantum state and the
variances of position and momentum operators. Using a harmonic oscillator with
time-dependent mass and frequency as a toy model, we show that both circuit and
spread complexity at any instant is determined by the mean number of quanta and
its rate of change. Furthermore, both complexity and its growth are directly
linked to the variances of the position and momentum operators, providing a
clear physical interpretation of complexity in terms of the state's excitation
and phase-space fluctuation. Although the analysis is carried out for a single
time-dependent oscillator, the results have direct relevance for quantum field
theory in curved backgrounds, where individual field modes effectively behave
as time-dependent oscillators. This offers new insights into how quantum
complexity encodes particle production and phase space fluctuations in
non-holographic systems. Finally, we establish a precise and potentially
universal relation between spread and circuit complexity for the time evolved
state suggesting deeper connections between different complexity measures in
the context of field theories on curved backgrounds.

Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many
strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors,
whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation
and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing
correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their
off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density
measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states.
Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three
different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\'s Helios
trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing
induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model,
d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model
at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate
superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create
and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations,
opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.

Gaussian gates, such as displacement, squeezing, rotation, and beamsplitters to
emulate convolutional behavior. Our experiments are conducted on the MedMNIST
dataset collection, a set of annotated medical image benchmarks for multiple
diagnostic tasks. We evaluate CV-QCNN's performance in terms of classification
accuracy, model expressiveness, and resilience to Gaussian noise, comparing
against classical CNNs and equivalent DV quantum circuits. This study aims to
identify trade-offs between DV and CV paradigms for quantum-enhanced medical
imaging. Our results highlight the potential of continuous-variable models and

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for the analysis of non-Gaussian
entanglement in bosonic states of finite stellar rank. The central result is
the full characterization of their entanglement structure through the atomic
decomposition of their stellar polynomial and its associated structural graph,
whose connected components determine the mode-intrinsic entanglement content of
the state and all partitions compatible with passive separability. An essential
ingredient in this construction is the concept of essential variables, which
identify the minimal number of effective modes involved in a core state, in
direct correspondence with the symplectic rank. This reduction provides the
foundation for decomposing stellar polynomials into atomic factors and for
revealing the underlying entanglement structure. Building on this, we derive
complete separability criteria for two-mode states, expressed through
hyperplane decompositions of zero sets, and for stellar-rank-2 states across
arbitrary number of modes. Applications to several example states illustrate
how the method isolates genuinely non-Gaussian resources and quantifies
preparation complexity.

Motivation: reducing coherent errors in quantum operations is essential for developing reliable quantum computing systems.

Method: coupled two-transmon qubits through a fluxonium qubit to eliminate residual ZZ interactions even with large qubit detunings.

Result: fidelity of CZ gate reaches 99.64% and 99.68% in two devices, demonstrating effective error mitigation.

Conclusion: fluxonium-mediated coupling architecture provides a feasible solution to ZZ interaction issues in superconducting circuits, enhancing quantum gate fidelity.

Abstract: Eliminating residual ZZ interactions in a two-qubit system is essential for
reducing coherent errors during quantum operations. In a superconducting
circuit platform, coupling two transmon qubits via a transmon coupler has been
shown to effectively suppress residual ZZ interactions. However, in such
systems, perfect cancellation usually requires the qubit-qubit detuning to be
smaller than the individual qubit anharmonicities, which exacerbates frequency
crowding and microwave crosstalk. To address this limitation, we introduce TFT
(Transmon-Fluxonium-Transmon) architecture, wherein two transmon qubits are
coupled via a fluxonium qubit. The coupling mediated by the fluxonium
eliminates residual ZZ interactions even for transmons detuned larger than
their anharmonicities. We experimentally identified zero-ZZ interaction points
at qubit-qubit detunings of 409 MHz and 616 MHz from two distinct TFT devices.
We then implemented an adiabatic, coupler-flux-biased controlled-Z gate on both
devices, achieving CZ gate fidelities of 99.64(6)% and 99.68(8)%.

Abstract: Quantum correlations in the spatial domain hold great promise for
applications in quantum imaging, quantum cryptography and quantum information
processing, owing to the infinite dimensionality of the associated Hilbert
space. Here, we present a theoretical investigation, complemented by
experimental measurements, of the propagation dynamics of the spatial quantum
correlations in bright structured twin beams generated via a four-wave mixing
process in a double-$\Lambda$ configuration in atomic vapor. We derive an
analytical expression describing the evolution of the spatial quantum
correlation distribution from the near field to the far field. To qualitatively
support the theoretical predictions, we perform experiments measuring
intensity-difference noise between different spatial subregions of the twin
beams as they propagate from the near field to the far field. The presence of
quantum correlations is manifested as squeezing in the intensity difference
noise measurement. With a Gaussian pump, we observe localized correlations in
the near field and localized anti-correlations in the far field. In contrast,
with a structured Laguerre-Gaussian pump, there is a transition from localized
correlations in the near field to delocalized correlations in the far field.
The present results offer valuable insights into the fundamental behavior of
spatial quantum correlations and open possibilities for potential applications
in quantum information, quantum imaging and sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating efficient and reliable benchmarks for quantum computing is challenging, and existing methods often suffer from scalability issues or lack motivation.

Method: scarab uses efficient fidelity estimation techniques like mirror circuit fidelity estimation and subcircuit volumetric benchmarking to handle large-scale quantum circuits with thousands or millions of qubits.

Result: The tool enables users without expertise in quantum benchmarking to create effective benchmarks with a simple interface, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum computer evaluation.

Conclusion: scarab provides a powerful solution for overcoming the limitations of traditional benchmarking methods and enables better evaluation of quantum computers.

Abstract: Creating scalable, reliable, and well-motivated benchmarks for quantum
computers is challenging: straightforward approaches to benchmarking suffer
from exponential scaling, are insensitive to important errors, or use
poorly-motivated performance metrics. Furthermore, curated benchmarking suites
cannot include every interesting quantum circuit or algorithm, which
necessitates a tool that enables the easy creation of new benchmarks. In this
work, we introduce a software tool for creating scalable and reliable
benchmarks that measure a well-motivated performance metric (process fidelity)
from user-chosen quantum circuits and algorithms. Our software, called
$\texttt{scarab}$, enables the creation of efficient and robust benchmarks even
from circuits containing thousands or millions of qubits, by employing
efficient fidelity estimation techniques, including mirror circuit fidelity
estimation and subcircuit volumetric benchmarking. $\texttt{scarab}$ provides a
simple interface that enables the creation of reliable benchmarks by users who
are not experts in the theory of quantum computer benchmarking or noise. We
demonstrate the flexibility and power of $\texttt{scarab}$ by using it to turn
existing inefficient benchmarks into efficient benchmarks, to create benchmarks
that interrogate hardware and algorithmic trade-offs in Hamiltonian simulation,
to quantify the in-situ efficacy of approximate circuit compilation, and to
create benchmarks that use subcircuits to measure progress towards executing a

TL;DR: Microscopic master equations are widely used for treating quantum systems, but single-particle approximations can lead to unphysical behavior. This paper introduces mathematical constraints to ensure these equations preserve fermionic statistics, addressing positivity issues. The constraints are applied to unified and universal master equations, and corrections using Pauli factors are explored for cases where constraints are violated. The work highlights the potential for using microscopic master equations in realistic chemical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and nanoscale systems, rely on accurate modeling of molecular spin and solid-state systems. Ensuring mathematical rigor, particularly in preserving physical properties like fermionic statistics, is crucial for developing reliable quantum technologies.

Method: The authors derive constraints on system-environment parameters to ensure microscopic master equations preserve fermionic, N-representable statistics. These constraints are applied to unified master equations and the universal Lindblad equation. For operators that violate the constraints, the method involves adding Pauli factors to recover N-representability.

Result: The proposed constraints are shown to address positivity issues in master equations. The authors demonstrate the application of these constraints to specific equations and explore the use of Pauli factors as a correction mechanism for cases where the constraints are not satisfied.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for ensuring the physical validity of microscopic master equations, which can facilitate their feasible application in realistic chemical systems without compromising their mathematical and physical integrity.

Abstract: Microscopic master equations have gained traction for the dissipative
treatment of molecular spin and solid-state systems for quantum technologies.
Single particle approximations are often invoked to treat these systems, which
can lead to unphysical evolution when combined with master equation approaches.
We present a mathematical constraint on the system-environment parameters to
ensure that microscopically-derived Markovian master equations preserve
fermionic, $N$-representable statistics when applied to reduced systems. We
demonstrate these constraints for the recently derived unified master equation
and universal Lindblad equation, along with the Redfield master equation for
cases when positivity issues are not present. For operators that break the
constraint, we explore the addition of Pauli factors to recover
$N$-representability. This work promotes feasible applications of novel
microscopic master equations for realistic chemical systems.

TL;DR: 在连续变量量子通信尤其是量子密钥分发协议中，相位对称相干态的区分是关键。我们提出了一个利用不可区分判别（UD）在确定性区间工作的策略，尽管引入的分离映射导致错误的概率不为零，但通过信息回放（IR）可以进一步利用失败状态中的信息进行区分。这种方法结合了MED和UD的优点，始终提供肯定结果，且一部分结果可完全正确，通过辅助系统可识别。此外，我们分析了状态分隔映射引入的干扰，证明其下界就是回放阶段的错误概率。在低振幅 regime中（适用于长途CV-QKD应用），该方法在失败事件后对输入状态的干扰较低。这些成果为连续变量环境中的适应式和顺序区分协议提供了新的可能，并可能用于未来量子通信中接收器设计的 next-generation。

Motivation: 量子通信中的连续变量（CV）环境在实际应用中非常关键，如量子密钥分发协议（CV-QKD）。这些协议依赖于区分不同相干态以建立共享秘密密钥。当前，关于如何有效区分相位对称相干态的研究有许多挑战，因此开发新的区分策略非常必要。

Method: 我们提出了一种利用不可区分判别（UD）在确定性区间工作的策略。为了使UD在失败事件中保留残留信息，我们引入了信息回放（IR）过程。通过这一方法，我们可以将失败状态中的信息进一步用于区分，从而优化整体错误概率。

Result: 通过对失败状态进行回放的策略（信息回放IR）不仅提供了肯定的结果，还能通过辅助系统识别出一部分完全正确的结果。此外，在低振幅regime下，分隔映射引入的干扰较低，同时回放阶段的错误概率得到了控制，这为后续应用奠定基础。

Conclusion: 我们的研究展示了如何在连续变量环境中提高区分效率，结合了UD和MED的优点，为量子通信中的未来协议设计提供了新的方法和技术可能。

Abstract: The discrimination of coherent states is a crucial component in quantum
communication with continuous variables, especially in quantum key distribution
protocols (CV-QKD), which rely on the ability to distinguish among different
coherent states to establish a shared secret key between two parties. Here, we
propose and analyze a strategy for distinguishing among N phase-symmetric
coherent states, which optimally takes unambiguous discrimination (UD) to the
deterministic regime, at the inevitable cost of having non-zero probability of
error. Despite the disturbance introduced by the separation map used in the UD
process, we show that for N > 2, the "failure" states of UD retain residual
information about the original input states, which can be further used for
discrimination. Rather than discarding inconclusive outcomes as in conventional
UD, we show that the "failure" states of UD can be optimally recycled by
performing a sequential minimum-error discrimination (MED). This strategy,
which we call information recycling (IR), combines the benefits of both MED and
optimal UD: It always provides conclusive results while allowing for a subset
of those results to be error-free, which are identifiable by an ancillary
system. We characterize the disturbance introduced by the state separation map
by the infidelity between input and failure states, demonstrating that it lower
bounds the error probability in the recycling stage. Furthermore, in the
low-amplitude regime-relevant for long-distance CV-QKD applications-we show
that the state separation achieves significant success while introducing
relatively low disturbance to the input states after failed events. Our results
open up new possibilities for adaptive and sequential discrimination protocols
in continuous-variable settings, and could potentially be used in the design of
next-generation receivers in quantum communication.

Abstract: We investigate the decay of three-level artificial atom, a superconducting

we obtain analytical expressions for the frequency shifts and widths of the

TL;DR: A paper proposes a new multiplexing scheme for transmon qubit couplers to reduce wiring complexity in superconducting quantum processors while maintaining high gate operation fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and efficient superconducting qubit architectures is critical for advancing quantum computing. Efficient control lines minimize wiring overhead and scalability issues.

Method: The authors propose a double-transmon coupler (DTC) architecture with shared control lines. They experimentally validate this by implementing CZ and iSWAP gates and generating entangled states with high fidelity.

Result: The proposed scheme effectively reduces wiring complexity and suppresses static ZZ coupling, achieving high-fidelity quantum gate operations and entangled state generation.

Conclusion: This work presents a promising approach for scaling up superconducting quantum processors by optimizing control line multiplexing without sacrificing gate performance.

Abstract: Precise control of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing both
quantum simulation and quantum error correction. Recently, transmon qubit
systems employing the single-transmon coupler (STC) scheme have demonstrated
high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gate operations by dynamically tuning the
effective coupling between qubits. However, the integration of STCs increases
the number of control lines, thereby posing a significant bottleneck for chip
routing and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose a robust control
line multiplexing scheme based on a double-transmon coupler (DTC) architecture,
which enables shared coupler control lines to substantially reduce wiring
complexity. Moreover, we experimentally verify that this multiplexed
configuration efficiently suppresses undesirable static $ZZ$ coupling while
maintaining accurate control over two-qubit gate operations. We further
demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture through two distinct gate
implementations: a fast coupler $Z$-control-based CZ gate and a parametric
iSWAP gate. To validate the practical applicability of this multiplexing
approach in quantum circuits, we prepare Bell and three-qubit GHZ states using
the proposed scheme with fidelity exceeding 99% and 96%, respectively. This
multiplexed DTC architecture offers significant potential to minimize wiring
overhead in two-dimensional qubit arrays, thereby greatly enhancing the
scalability of superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Previous numerical analyses on the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) operator representing
the quantum time-of-arrival (TOA) observable for the free particle have
indicated that its eigenfunctions represent quantum states with definite
arrival time at the arrival point. In this paper, we give the mathematical
proof that this is indeed the case. An essential element of this proof is the
consideration of the eigenfunctions of the AB operator with complex
eigenvalues. These eigenfunctions can be considered legitimate TOA
eigenfunctions because they evolve unitarily to collapse at the arrival point
at the time equal to the real part of their eigenvalue. We show that the
time-evolved TOA position probability density distribution evaluated at the
time equal to the real part of the eigenvalue forms a dirac delta sequence in
the limit as the imaginary part of the eigenvalue approaches zero.

Motivation: Understanding quantum systems and simulating them using advanced materials like carbon nanotubes is crucial for advancing quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method: The study uses carbon nanotubes hosting quantum dots, analyzing their coupled electromechanical and phonon behaviors.

Result: The system exhibits strong electron-electron attraction via phonons, enabling maximally entangled Bell states at mesoscale systems, promising as simulators for strongly correlated quantum systems.

Conclusion: This setup provides a scalable, versatile platform for exploring quantum interactions in correlated electron systems, offering potential applications in quantum materials research and beyond.

Abstract: Suspended carbon nanotubes hosting electrostatically defined quantum dots
allow for exceptionally strong and tunable electromechanical coupling as well
as mechanical modes that can reach the quantum ground state of motion simply by
cryogenic cooling. This makes them a unique platform for quantum simulation of
electron-phonon coupling. Here, we propose an experimentally realisable setup
with two such carbon nanotubes in parallel, each hosting four quantum dots. Our
system not only exhibits phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction, but also
supports a robust, maximally entangled Bell phase at mesoscopic scales shared
across the subsystems. These features highlight its potential as a simulator of
strongly correlated quantum systems.

By leveraging Rydberg-mediated interactions and introducing detuning, the
system is effectively simplified into a chain-like configuration. To design
effective couplings, we employ a centrosymmetric Gaussian distribution and
optimize the relevant parameters. Furthermore, we take into account decoherence
factors including atomic spontaneous emission, dephasing effects and random
noise. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed scheme can achieve high

Abstract: We develop and solve a Dicke superradiant model with two or more competing
collective decay channels of tunable rates. Recent work analyzed stationary
properties of multichannel Dicke superradiance using hydrodynamic mean-field
approximations as shown by Mok et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L022015 (2025)]. We
extend this with a symbolic quantum-trajectory method, providing a simple route
to analytic solutions. For two channels, the behavior of the stationary
ground-state distribution resembles a first-order phase transition at the point
where the channel-rate ratio is equal to unity. For $d$ competing channels, we
obtain scaling laws for the superradiant peak time and intensity. These results
unify and extend single-channel Dicke dynamics to multilevel emitters and
provide a compact tool for cavity and waveguide experiments, where
permutation-symmetric reservoirs engineer multiple collective decay paths.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to optimize quantum matrix operations, which are fundamental in many quantum computing applications.

Method: The authors design specific unitary transformations and auxiliary measurements to create efficient quantum schemes for the three matrix operations. They also provide circuit diagrams to illustrate their methods.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve computational depths of O(1) for Kronecker products, O(max(m,n)) for Hadamard products, and O(m) for elementary column transformations of (2^n × 2^m) matrices. These results are noted for reducing computational steps and quantum gate usage, thereby lowering energy costs in quantum computing.

Conclusion: By optimizing quantum algorithms for matrix operations, the paper contributes to more efficient quantum computing, particularly in reducing energy consumption.

Abstract: This paper focuses on quantum algorithms for three key matrix operations:
Hadamard (Schur) product, Kronecker (tensor) product, and elementary column
transformations each. By designing specific unitary transformations and
auxiliary quantum measurement, efficient quantum schemes with circuit diagrams
are proposed. Their computational depths are: O(1) for Kronecker product;
O(max(m,n)) for Hadamard product (linked to matrix dimensions); and O(m) for
elementary column transformations of (2^n X 2^m) matrices (dependent only on
column count).Notably, compared to traditional column transformation via matrix
transposition and row transformations, this scheme reduces computation steps
and quantum gate usage, lowering quantum computing energy costs.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a hybrid quantum repeater architecture that combines
two leading hardware platforms: quantum dots (QDs) as bright, deterministic
sources of entangled photon pairs and group-IV-vacancy centers in diamond as
efficient, heralded quantum memories. This combination leverages high-rate
entanglement generation together with long-lived storage, enabling scalable
entanglement distribution over long distances. A key challenge is the large
bandwidth mismatch between QD photons and the narrow optical transitions of the
memories. We combine a comprehensive model of the spin-photon interface,
including full spin-photon coupling dynamics, and explore mitigation strategies
such as frequency filtering and optimized magnetic-field orientation. Our
results show that with optimized designs, photon-to-memory transfer can be
achieved with high efficiency and fidelity, supporting the feasibility of such
hybrid systems. Finally, we analyze a full repeater chain using experimentally
achievable parameters and find that a network with thousands of memories across
several repeater nodes could achieve a secret-key rate of 500 bit/s over 1,000

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Security in machine learning is fragile when data are exfiltrated or
perturbed, yet existing frameworks rarely connect the definition and analysis
of the security to learnability. In this work, we develop a theory of secure
learning grounded in the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) viewpoint and
develop an operational framework that links data-path behavior to finite-sample
budgets. In our formulation, an accuracy-confidence target is evaluated via a
run-based sequential test that halts after a prescribed number of consecutive
validations, and a closed-form budget bound guarantees the learning success if
the data-path channel is admissible; the acceptance must also exceed a
primitive random-search baseline. We elevate and complete our secure-learning
construction in the context of quantum information -- establishing
quantum-secure PAC learning: for prepare-and-measure scenarios, the data-path
admissibility is set to be threshold fixed by Holevo information, not a
learner-tunable tolerance. Thus, a certified information advantage for the
learner directly becomes the learning security -- an effect with no classical
analogue. The channel-determined confidence follows naturally and basis sifting
is incorporated for practical deployments. This is the first complete framework
that simultaneously embeds a security notion and an operational sample-budget
law within the PAC learning and anchors the security in quantum information.
The resulting blueprint points toward standardized guarantees for the learning
security, with clear avenues for PAC-Bayes extensions and for integration with
advanced quantum machine learning front ends.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate quantum data compression exploiting hidden
subgroup symmetries using a photonic quantum processor. Classical databases
containing generalized periodicities-symmetries that are in the worst cases
inefficient for known classical algorithms to be detect-can efficiently
compressed by quantum hidden subgroup algorithms. We implement a variational
quantum autoencoder that autonomously learns both the symmetry type (e.g.,
$\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vs. $\mathbb{Z}_4$) and the generalized
period from structured data. The system uses single photons encoded in path,
polarization, and time-bin degrees of freedom, with electronically controlled
waveplates enabling tunable quantum gates. Training via gradient descent
successfully identifies the hidden symmetry structure, achieving compression by
eliminating redundant database entries. We demonstrate two circuit ansatzes: a
parametrized generalized Fourier transform and a less-restricted architecture
for Simon's symmetry. Both converge successfully, with the cost function
approaching zero as training proceeds. These results provide experimental
proof-of-principle that photonic quantum computers can compress classical
databases by learning symmetries inaccessible to known efficient classical
methods, opening pathways for quantum-enhanced information processing.

*Caleb Blumenfeld*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses an attempt to make the time-convolutionless master equation (TCL-ME) more resistant to breakdown by replacing the invertibility assumption with the Moore-Penrose inverse. The modified equation was tested up to sixth and fifth orders on the Jaynes-Cummings and Ising models, respectively, but it failed to capture the dynamics of the exact solution compared to the standard TCL due to scalings that grow exponentially with the dimension of the bath. The failure is linked to a loss of convergence of the perturbative expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the robustness of the TCL-ME, which is a significant issue in open quantum systems research, where numerical instabilities and breakdowns can be problematic for practical applications.

Method: The modification involves using the Moore-Penrose inverse instead of assuming a portion of the generator is invertible. The authors rederived the perturbative expansion using Israel and Charnes' result and tested the equation on the Jaynes-Cummings and Ising models up to sixth and fifth orders, respectively.

Result: The modified TCL-ME fails to capture the dynamics of the exact solution compared to the standard TCL approach, particularly due to terms that scale exponentially with the size of the bath. This is attributed to a loss in the convergence of the perturbative expansion.

Conclusion: The proposed modification does not adequately address the breakdown issues or improve the accuracy of the TCL-ME for larger systems, highlighting the need for alternative approaches in handling high-dimensional baths.

Abstract: We attempt to modify the time-convolutionless master equation (TCL-ME) to be

the equation up to sixth and fifth orders on the Jaynes-Cummings and Ising
models, respectively. We find that in both cases, the modified equation fails
to capture the dynamics of the exact solution compared to the standard TCL due
to the terms of the modified equation scaling exponentially with the dimension
of the bath, and connect this failure to a loss of convergence of the

that this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising paradigm for tackling
computational problems that challenge classical AI. Yet, the inherent
probabilistic behavior of quantum mechanics, device noise in NISQ hardware, and
hybrid quantum-classical execution pipelines introduce new risks that prevent
reliable deployment of QML in real-world, safety-critical settings. This

quantification for calibrated and risk-aware decision making, (ii) adversarial
robustness against classical and quantum-native threat models, and (iii)
privacy preservation in distributed and delegated quantum learning scenarios.
We formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information
theory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty,
trace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning
channels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a
unified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers,
uncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry
in attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and
privacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise. This
roadmap seeks to define trustworthiness as a first-class design objective for
quantum AI.

TL;DR: The study introduces AQIA, a framework for adaptive programmable quantum matter using a Hamiltonian-based methodology. Agents maintain quantum coherence and interact via state-dependent feedback channels, enabling dynamic reconfiguration of static lattices. The framework operates across a range of quantum platforms and exhibits distinct organizational regimes under varying feedback conditions.

Motivation: This paper advances the understanding of adaptive quantum systems and their applications in programmable matter, offering insights into self-organization and learning mechanisms in quantum environments.

Method: The AQIA framework employs a Hamiltonian-based approach with agents maintaining quantum coherence, interacting via feedback channels characterized by spin polarisation, bond correlation, and internal energy. A mean-field approximation is used to resolve the effective Hamiltonian, iteratively adjusting feedback fields to minimize energy. Numerical simulations identify three distinct regimes leading to domain formation, glass-like frustration, and modular polarisation.

Result: The AQIA framework demonstrates its adaptability and effectiveness on various quantum platforms, highlighting the potential for exploring self-organisation and learning in adaptive quantum systems. The investigation reveals three distinct organizational regimes, underscoring the role of informational similarity and feedback in quantum matter's structure.

Conclusion: This framework provides a versatile model for studying self-organisation and learning in adaptive programmable quantum matter, with potential applications across different quantum computing platforms. The identification of distinct organizational regimes underpin the importance of feedback mechanisms in quantum system design and operation.

Abstract: The study introduces the Adaptive Quantum Ising Agents (AQIA) framework, a
Hamiltonian-based methodology that extends programmable quantum matter into an
adaptive domain. Each agent operates as a finite transverse-field Ising
subsystem, maintaining internal quantum coherence while interacting through
state-dependent feedback channels characterised by reduced observables such as
spin polarisation, bond correlation, and internal energy. These informational
couplings enable the transformation of a static lattice into a
feedback-reconfigurable medium. The effective Hamiltonian generated, which
remains Hermitian at each iteration, is resolved self-consistently using a
mean-field approximation, where the feedback fields are iteratively adjusted to
minimise the total energy. Numerical investigations identify three distinct
regimes: domain formation near the feedback--fluctuation critical point,
glass-like frustration due to competing feedback channels, and modular
polarisation sustained by structured interactions. These phenomena occur
independently of geometric embedding, illustrating that informational
similarity alone can induce coherent organisation. The AQIA framework is
adaptable to implementation on superconducting, trapped-ion, or Rydberg
platforms, offering a minimalistic model for exploring self-organisation and
learning in adaptive programmable quantum matter.

Abstract: The travelling salesman problem is a well-known example of
computationally-hard combinatorial problem for classical machines. Here, we
propose a novel variational quantum algorithm to solve it. The method is based
on the preparation of two maximally entangled quantum registers whose
correlations are assigned to different paths between pairs of cities. For $N$
cities, this encoding requires $2 \lceil\log_2 N\rceil$ qubits and the solution
to the problem is directly found in the correlation matrix of the two registers
composing the overall trial state. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we
implement this algorithm for generic problems with four cities on a
reconfigurable room-temperature silicon photonic circuit with integrated
photon-pair sources, used to initialize maximally entangled path-encoded
single-photon states.

Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic structures are an excellent platform
for controllable single-photon scattering. The tunable light-matter interaction
enables the construction of a single-photon switch -- a device that can route a
single photon from an input port to a selected output port. Such single-photon
switching devices can be integrated into reconfigurable photonic circuits to
actively control the photon propagation direction in a quantum network.
Ideally, a single-photon switch should be fast, efficient, scalable, compatible
with existing technology, and should preserve the routed photon states with
high fidelity. In this review, we focus on theoretical proposals and
experimental demonstrations of single-photon switches based on quantum emitters
coupled to solid-state nanostructures, including waveguide and cavity
architectures. We also present the theoretical methods that are commonly used
to model single-photon scattering in waveguide-based systems by applying them
to the elementary system of a two-level emitter coupled to a waveguide. This
review brings together key theoretical techniques from quantum optics, their
applications to controllable single-photon transport, and the experimental
realization of single-photon switching devices across different physical
platforms, including semiconductor quantum dots, neutral atoms, superconducting
qubits, and color centers.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a VQGAP algorithm to optimize the use of quantum resources for solving the Generalized Assignment Problem, reducing the required qubits and circuit depth compared to standard VQE while maintaining similar performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on quantum computing for solving NP-complete optimization problems like the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) necessitates efficient algorithms that optimize quantum resource usage, especially for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Method: The authors introduce VQGAP, a hybrid quantum-classical approach that decouples qubits from binary variables by employing encoding/decoding functions, and optimizes the quantum resource usage by reducing the number of qubits and circuit depth used.

Result: Preliminary simulations, both noiseless and noisy, show that VQGAP performs similarly to VQE in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and behavior, while significantly reducing the qubit and circuit depth requirements.

Conclusion: VQGAP offers a promising solution for optimizing resource usage in quantum algorithms for solving real-world optimization problems, particularly on noisy NISQ devices, by effectively reducing qubit and circuit requirements.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer a compelling new avenue for addressing difficult
NP-complete optimization problems, such as the Generalized Assignment Problem
(GAP). Given the operational constraints of contemporary Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, hybrid quantum-classical approaches,
specifically Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) like the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE), promises to be effective approaches to solve real-world
optimization problems. This paper proposes an approach, named VQGAP, designed
to efficiently solve the GAP by optimizing quantum resources and reducing the
required parametrized quantum circuit width with respect to standard VQE. The
main idea driving our proposal is to decouple the qubits of ansatz circuits
from the binary variables of the General Assignment Problem, by providing
encoding/decoding functions transforming the solutions generated by ansatze in
the limited quantum space in feasible solutions in the problem variables space,
by exploiting the constraints of the problem. Preliminary results, obtained
through both noiseless and noisy simulations, indicate that VQGAP exhibits
performance and behavior very similar to VQE, while effectively reducing the
number of qubits and circuit depth.

*James Hefford,Matt Wilson*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a new process called hyper-decoherence that explains how standard quantum theory arises from a higher-order quantum theory with the non-signalling tensor product. It circumvents a no-go theorem by relaxing certain constraints and explores opposing interpretations of this process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are investigating the emergence of standard quantum theory from a higher-order quantum theory, aiming to understand the role of hyper-decoherence in this process.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis of axioms and constructs a hyper-decoherence map that produces standard quantum theory from quantum boxes.

Result: The hyper-decoherence map successfully demonstrates how standard quantum theory can be derived from a higher-order quantum theory without violating the no-go theorem of Lee and Selby by relaxing constraints on signaling and uniqueness of purifications.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that hyper-decoherence could be a valid mechanism for deriving causal quantum theory from a causally indefinite higher-order theory or highlight the need for re-evaluation of hyper-decoherence axioms, especially concerning the role of purity.

Abstract: We find a process satisfying the axioms of hyper-decoherence which produces
standard quantum theory from the theory of quantum boxes (higher-order quantum
theory with the non-signalling tensor product). This hyper-decoherence map
evades the no-go theorem of Lee and Selby by relaxing constraints on signalling
to the past and the uniqueness of purifications. We discuss some natural
opposing conclusions: that the existence of this map might be evidence of a
genuine hyper-decoherence process producing causal quantum theory from its
causally-indefinite higher-order theory; or that it serves as an indication
that the axioms of hyper-decoherence might need careful re-consideration,
especially regarding the subtle albeit central role that purity plays.

The study identifies an optimal Er concentration of 3 percent for maximal vortex-transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the absorption and dispersion spectra reveal the mechanism underpinning the vortex transfer and demonstrate tunable transitions between fast and slow regimes.

Conclusion: The findings establish Er YAG as a viable solid-state platform for coherent manipulation of structured light, facilitating efficient vortex-beam frequency conversion and dispersion engineering, with potential applications in high-dimensional quantum communication, wavelength-compatible OAM interfaces, and slow-light photonic signal processing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: By analysing the growth of Krylov complexity for some simple models, we find
that the exponential growth of an operator in Hilbert space can be predicted
from the off-diagonal decay of the operator matrix elements in the system
eigenbasis. When the decay is exponential or slower, the Krylov complexity
grows exponentially; when it is algebraic or slower, the growth rate is
maximal. As a result, non-chaotic systems can generate exponential or even
maximal operator growth, and chaotic systems can show sub-exponential growth;
we give examples of both.

Motivation: Understanding electron dynamics in high-energy environments is crucial for various fields such as plasma physics and astrophysics. Accurate modeling of Bremsstrahlung emission helps in these areas by providing detailed insights into the behavior of electrons in different environments.

Method: The paper introduces a fully analytic screening model based on a multi-Yukawa representation of the atomic potential. This model allows for the calculation of bremsstrahlung cross sections for any nuclear charge and ionization state, and for electron energies up to several tens of MeV.

Result: The proposed framework extends prior models that only considered neutral atoms by incorporating partially ionized high-Z elements. This is a significant advancement as it allows for a more accurate description of electron-ion interactions in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: This study provides a robust analytical tool for modeling Bremsstrahlung emission, enhancing our ability to study electron dynamics in high-energy environments, particularly involving high-Z partially ionized atoms.

Abstract: Bremsstrahlung emission remains a cornerstone process in the characterization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the accuracy of iToF cameras by addressing the interference caused by light scattering within the camera.

Method: Developed a calibration-based model with three interpretable parameters based on real data to describe scattering effects from foreground size, exposure conditions, and optical path differences.

Result: The calibrated model effectively compensates scattering-induced errors, leading to significant improvement in depth measurements under varying illumination and complex geometries.

Conclusion: A practical, cost-effective solution for iToF systems without hardware modifications, enhancing accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: In-camera light scattering is a typical form of non-systematic interference
in indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) cameras, primarily caused by multiple
reflections and optical path variations within the camera body. This effect can
significantly reduce the accuracy of background depth measurements. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a calibration-based model derived from real
measurement data, introducing three physically interpretable calibration
parameters: a normal-exposure amplitude influence coefficient, an overexposure
amplitude influence coefficient, and a scattering phase shift coefficient.
These parameters are used to describe the effects of foreground size, exposure
conditions, and optical path differences on scattering interference.
Experimental results show that the depth values calculated using the calibrated
parameters can effectively compensate for scattering-induced errors,
significantly improving background depth recovery in scenarios with complex
foreground geometries and varying illumination conditions. This approach
provides a practical, low-cost solution for iToF systems, requiring no complex
hardware modifications, and can substantially enhance measurement accuracy and
robustness across a wide range of real-world applications.

Abstract: We investigate the induced modulation instability in second-harmonic
generation beyond the early stage of the linearized growth of the modulation.
We find a regime of recurrence (quasi-periodic conversion and back-conversion
between the pump and the modulation) which is genuine of the parametric
conversion process in quadratic media. Such recurrence is mainly driven by a
process of non-degenerate downconversion, showing no analogy to the cascading
regime which mimics the cubic (Kerr) nonlinearities. We consider two different
steady states, i.e., a pure second-harmonic and a mixed
fundamental/second-harmonic state. Both exhibit this dynamics, which we show to
be amenable to a description in terms of reduced frequency-truncated models.
The comparison with full numerical simulations of the starting model prove the
validity and robustness of the reduced models in characterizing in a simple and
elegant way a wide range of modulationally-unstable steady states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高体积制造业（HVM）需要高精度、高效率的涂膜光度计量方法，而传统方法受模型依赖和增益降低的限制，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: LRZ方法通过线性化相位响应和在波数空间中提取零交点位置，消除了传统方法对光谱采样和干涉衰减的敏感性，从而实现了无模型的测量。

Result: LRZ方法在铝普京膜上的80多次测量结果显示，其与WLI方法具有高度相关性（r=0.97），且重复性和再现性优异（GR&R<3%），同时平均MAM（移动-获取-测量）时间为约2秒，是WLI方法的7倍快。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了高效、准确且模型无关的厚涂料光度计量方法，为高体积制造业提供了实用的工艺控制解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and high-efficiency film metrology remains a key challenge in
High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM), where conventional spectroscopic reflectometry
and white light interferometry (WLI) are either limited by model dependence or
throughput. In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of
reflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the
Linearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the
previously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but
eliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that
degrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and
extracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and
repeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable
accuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional
model-based methods. Validation using more than 80 measurements on alumina
films over NiFe substrates shows excellent correlation with WLI (r = 0.97) and
low gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R < 3%). Moreover, LRZ achieves
an average Move-Acquire-Measure (MAM) time of approximately 2 s, which is about
7 times faster than WLI. The proposed method enables fast, accurate, and
model-independent optical metrology for thick films, offering a practical
solution for advanced HVM process control.

Motivation: Nonlinear photonics applications require high-quality SiN microresonators, prompting research into their fabrication and optical properties.

Method: The study uses subtractive fabrication methods with electron beam lithography, comparing a polymer and metallic etch-mask.

Result: Findings reveal the effects of fabrication processes on resonator properties, such as optical loss and dispersion, which are critical for applications like frequency combs.

Conclusion: Polymers and metallic masks offer trade-offs, and lithography parameters influence optical loss, guiding device optimization for nonlinear optics.

Abstract: Silicon nitride (SiN) has emerged as a popular platform for nonlinear
photonics due to its large bandgap, relatively large nonlinear index of
refraction, and high degree of CMOS-compatibility. Nonlinear optical processes
in microresonators require both large quality factors to promote build-up of
large intracavity powers and sufficient control over resonator dispersion to
implement phase-matching, which is generally achieved through careful design
and fabrication of the resonator cross-sectional dimensions. Additionally,
generating dissipative Kerr soliton optical frequency combs requires operation
in the anomalous dispersion regime, which calls for such thick layers of SiN as
to make achieving accuracy during etching a challenge. In this work, we
investigate the relationship between fabrication process details, including
lithography and etching, and optical properties, such as optical loss and
resonator dispersion, for two different subtractive fabrication approaches: one
utilizing a polymer-based electron beam resist as the protective mask during
etching and the other employing a thin metallic etch-mask. Using both
approaches, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of polymer and metal
etch-masks, determine the origins of optical loss through variations in
electron beam lithography parameters, and connect resonator sidewall roughness
to optical loss. Finally, we compare frequency comb generation in resonators
fabricated using either approach.

Abstract: The Wigner function is a phase space quasi-probability distribution whose
negative regions provide a direct, local signature of nonclassicality. To
identify where phase-sensitive structure concentrates, we introduce local
positive- and negative Wigner-mass maps and adopt the integrated Wigner
negativity as a compact scalar measure of nonclassical phase space structure. A
decomposition of the density operator reveals that off-diagonal coherences
between hybridizing components generate oscillatory, sign-alternating patterns,
with the negative contribution maximized when component weights are comparable.
Non-Gaussian chaotic eigenmodes exhibit a baseline negativity that is further
amplified by such hybridization. We validate these diagnostics across two
billiard geometries and argue that the framework is transferable to other
wave-chaotic platforms, where it can aid mode engineering and coherence
control.

Abstract: Ultrafast all-optical magnetization switching (AOS) holds great promise for
nextgeneration spintronic memory and hybrid spintronic-photonic systems.
However, most implementations to date rely on bulky free-space optical setups,
limiting scalability and practical integration. As a critical step toward
integrated applications, we demonstrate single-pulse AOS within a silicon
nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuit. Using trains of femtosecond laser
pulses guided through on-chip waveguides, we achieve deterministic toggle
switching in a sub-micron out-of-plane Co/Gd Hall cross patterned directly atop
the photonic waveguide. Electrical readout via the anomalous Hall effect
reveals a switching contrast of up to 90% for 500 nm-wide devices. In larger
Hall crosses, the contrast decreases and switching becomes stochastic,
consistent with spatially non-uniform optical absorption as confirmed by
finite-element simulations. This behavior is hypothetically attributed to
domain wall relaxation and thermally assisted (de)pinning processes within
partially switched regions. Our results highlight the critical role of device
scaling in achieving robust on-chip AOS and establish a foundation for
ultrafast, energy-efficient, and fully integrated spintronic-photonic
platforms.

Abstract: Fully-textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have emerged as
promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. The optical functions
of full texturing, however, are not yet fully understood. A key challenge is
the requirement for perovskite layer texturing, which often leads to increased
electrical losses. Here, we elucidate the distinct optical roles of front and
rear textures in tandem configurations using optical simulations and use these
insights to propose a new architecture that eliminates the need for perovskite
surface texturing. We demonstrate that our proposed structure achieves optical
results comparable to those of fully-textured devices, while its planar
perovskite layer has the potential to reduce electrical losses. The high
optical performance also results in higher efficiency if a texture-induced
voltage loss as low as 50 mV is assumed, which is about six times lower than
the loss of fully-textured devices, thus enabling higher efficiencies within a
simplified design. Our results show that perovskite texturing is not essential
for optimal light management, thus opening the way to combine efficient light
management with high electrical performance.

Conclusion: 人工引入非线性有助于揭示其他非线性拓扑系统的索尔顿动力学。

Abstract: The interplay between nonlinear and topological physics has led to intriguing
emergent phenomena, such as quantized and fractionally quantized Thouless
pumping of solitons dictated by the topological invariants of the underlying
band structure. Unlike linear Thouless pumping, which requires excitation of a
Wannier function of a uniformly filled band, quantized soliton pumping is
observed even with localized excitations that do not represent Wannier
functions. Here, we show that similar soliton-like quantized pumping can be
observed in Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model by introducing a synthetic
nonlinearity in the form of a cutoff on the coupling strengths between lattice
sites. More importantly, we reveal that the localized excitations driving
quantized soliton pumping are precisely the Wannier functions of the uniformly
filled bands of the effectively nonlinear lattice, thus restoring consistency
with linear Thouless pumping. We extend this approach to multi-band systems and
show that the nonlinearity introduces a degeneracy between bands, subsequently
leading to the observation of fractionally quantized pumping. Our approach of
introducing a synthetic nonlinearity is general and could be extended to reveal
soliton dynamics in other nonlinear topological systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The investigation of the limits of photoemission yield in radiofrequency photoinjectors is motivated by the need to understand and optimize their performance for advanced applications such as ultrafast electron diffraction, microscopy, and high-brightness light sources. The space-charge-dominated regime is particularly challenging, and this research provides experimental and theoretical insights into the behavior of these systems under extreme conditions.

Abstract: Improvement in SRF accelerator performance after in-tunnel plasma processing
has been seen at SNS and CEBAF. Plasma processing development for FRIB
quarter-wave and half-wave resonators (QWRs, HWRs) was initiated in 2020.
Plasma processing on individual QWRs (beta = 0.085) and HWRs (beta = 0.53) has
been found to significantly reduce field emission. A challenge for the FRIB
cavities is the relatively weak fundamental power coupler (FPC) coupling
strength (chosen for efficient continuous-wave acceleration), which produces a
lot of mismatch during plasma processing at room temperature. For FRIB QWRs,
driving the plasma with higher-order modes (HOMs) is beneficial to reduce the
FPC mismatch and increase the plasma density. The first plasma processing trial
on a spare FRIB QWR cryomodule was done in January 2024, with before-and-after
bunker tests and subsequent installation into the linac tunnel. The first
in-tunnel plasma processing trial was completed in September 2025. For both
cryomodules, before-and-after cold tests showed a significant increase in the
average accelerating gradient for field emission onset after plasma processing
for some cavities. In parallel with the cryomodule trials, the use of
dual-drive plasma is being explored with the goal of improving the
effectiveness of plasma processing.

Abstract: The model of magnetic monopoles that was proposed by Paul Dirac in 1931 has
long been a subject of theoretical interest in physics because of its potential
to explain the quantization of electric charge. While much attention has been
given to non-Dirac monopoles, Dirac's model, which involves an infinitely thin
solenoid known as a Dirac string, presents subtleties in the interaction
between monopoles. In this paper, we show that the force between two Dirac
monopoles obeys a Coulomb-like interaction law. This derivation offers an
instructive exercise in fundamental electromagnetism concepts and is
appropriate for undergraduate and early graduate-level students.

TL;DR:  paper discusses bio-based composite sandwich structures with balsa wood and other materials, focusing on their hygrothermal aging behavior over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: industries like aviation and maritime are seeking greener alternatives to reduce carbon emissions. balsa wood is a promising material, but its high hydrophilic behavior can affect its mechanical performance. the study aims to understand the impact of moisture on these structures over time.

Method: the researchers used two complete moisture absorption-desorption cycles to test three types of specimens: pure balsa wood, resin-infused balsa, and balsa core sandwich structures with glass fiber-reinforced polymer skins. they monitored changes in moisture content and hygroscopic strains in different directions to analyze swelling and thermal shrinkage.

Result: the tests revealed that the balsa wood core sandwich structures experience significant hygroscopic swelling and thermal shrinkage over time. the addition of glass fiber-reinforced polymers reduced moisture-induced strain but not completely eliminated it.

Conclusion: while the balsa wood core sandwich structures show promise as green, composite materials, their hygrothermal behavior must be carefully managed to ensure long-term durability and reliability in industrial applications.

Abstract: The objective of developing bio-based composite sandwich structures with
greener core materials is to facilitate the decarbonization of industries such
as aviation and maritime. This field of research has received increasing
attention over the past decades. For example, balsa wood has emerged as a
highly promising alternative to foam or honeycomb cores, offering a
lightweight, rapidly renewable and cost-effective solution. However, plant
fibers such as balsa wood and flax often display high hydrophilic behavior,
which could affect their mechanical performance and long-term durability. It is
therefore imperative to promote further research into the characterization of
the cyclic hygrothermal aging behavior of balsa wood core sandwich structures,
in particular the identification of moistureinduced strains and internal
stresses in the skins and cores, as well as the investigation of moisture
desorption processes and the associated thermal shrinkage phenomena in wood
fibers, resins and glass fibers. Accordingly, this work employs two complete
moisture absorption-desorption cycles to characterize the moisture diffusion
behavior of specimens comprising three different materials, including the pure
balsa wood, resin-infused balsa and balsa core sandwich structures with two
Glass-Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer (GFRP) skins. The changes in moisture content
and hygroscopic strains in the thickness, length and width directions of all
specimens were investigated with a view to identifying the hygroscopic swelling
and thermal shrinkage behaviors exhibited during long-term aging cycles.

Conclusion: 在Banach空间中研究了R-、Baxter和Nijenhuis括号，推广了Adler-Kostant-Symes定理，用于解决Lax方程和半无限Toda晶格。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the theory of $R$-brackets, Baxter brackets and
Nijenhuis brackets in the Banach setting, in particular in relation with Banach
Poisson-Lie groups. The notion of Banach Lie--Poisson space with respect to an
arbitrary duality pairing is crucial for the equations of motion to make sense.
In the presence of a non-degenerate invariant pairing on a Banach Lie algebra,
these equations of motion assume a Lax form. We prove a version of the
Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem adapted to $R$-matrices on infinite-dimensional
Banach algebras. Applications to the resolution of Lax equations associated to
some Banach Manin triples are given. The semi-infinite Toda lattice is also
presented as an example of this approach.

Conclusion: 该研究为分析双阱体系中量子动力学提供了可靠的方法学，对氢键相关研究具有广泛指导意义。

Abstract: Hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in chemistry, biology, and
condensed-matter physics, where quantum tunnelling can strongly influence
structure and dynamics. Isotope substitution (H $\rightarrow$ D) provides a
sensitive probe of such tunnelling, but theoretical descriptions often rely on
purely numerical models or simplified potentials that obscure physical
interpretation. Here we employ a Cornell-type potential combined with a
double-well Schr\"odinger approach to investigate proton and deuteron
tunnelling across hydrogen bonds. The model yields semi-analytical
wavefunctions and tunnelling splittings that transparently capture
isotope-dependent quantum effects. We present scaling behaviour of tunnelling
splittings with isotope mass, discuss the influence of barrier width and
curvature, and compare model trends with representative experimental and
computational results. Beyond hydrogen bonding, the framework provides a
general methodology for modelling tunnelling in double-well systems relevant to
spectroscopy, enzymatic catalysis, and materials applications.

Abstract: A theoretical approach to describing transport of an entire ensemble of
clusters with different sizes as a single species in gas has been developed.
The major assumption is an existence of local partial chemical equilibrium
between the clusters. It is shown that thermal diffusion emerges in the
collective description as a significant factor even if it is negligible when
transport of the original molecular species is considered. Analytical
expressions for the effective diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients at
temperature, pressure, and chemical composition gradients have been derived.
The theory has been applied to a technology of H2S conversion in a centrifugal
plasma-chemical reactor and has made it possible to account for sulfur clusters
in numerical process modeling.

TL;DR: The paper discusses quantum tunneling in hydrogen bonds, comparing analytical and numerical approaches using a 1D model. The results validate the utility of simplified models despite caution against their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum tunneling in hydrogen bonds is essential for various fields like chemistry and biochemistry, driving the development of accurate modeling methods.

Method: The study employs the WKB approximation and finite-difference numerical solutions. A Cornell-type potential is used to model the double-well system relevant to hydrogen-bond tunneling.

Result: The 1D model predicts a tunneling splitting of ~0.037 cm⁻¹ for the FAD dimer, closely matching results from multidimensional studies.

Conclusion: While 1D models are effective for conceptualization and benchmarks, they may not fully capture the complexities of multidimensional systems.

Abstract: Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with
implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While
state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate
multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain
valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a
wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type
double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling.
Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared
across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test
case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well
model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx
2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about
$0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and
Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results
highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models,
while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative
to full multidimensional quantum treatments.

Abstract: The hydrogen entry behavior of a partially Zn-coated steel sheet in NaCl
solutions was investigated employing a polyaniline-based hydrogenochromic
sensor, electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests, and potential measurements
using a scanning Kelvin probe. While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the
steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen
entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution,
with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the
dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution
behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl
solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion
concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by
differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential
distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing
hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions.

Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron

than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the
adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer
is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden"

Abstract: Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding,
ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent
phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them
alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force
fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use
Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in
multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly
covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular
features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To
address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation
within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular
physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding
model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest
complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water,
and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a
single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to
\textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics
simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force
field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide
range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses
stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize
per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.

Abstract: In chemical graph theory, topological indices are widely used as numerical
descriptors for establishing quantitative structure-property relationships
(QSPR) and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). These indices
successfully correlate molecular structure with various physicochemical and
biological properties. In addition to these methods, the concept of edge
irregularity strength, a graph labeling measure, offers another perspective for
representing structural characteristics. In this context, the edge irregularity
strength concept provides a systematic way of assigning numerical labels to
atoms based on specific rules. In this work, we explore the chemical
applicability of the edge irregularity strength and demonstrate that it can
also serve as a predictive tool for physicochemical properties, similar to
topological indices. The findings show that the edge irregularity strength
captures molecular features and complements existing approaches to
structure-property analysis in chemical graph theory.

### [110] [Size-Consistent Adiabatic Connection Functionals via Orbital-Based Matrix Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01961)
*Kyle Bystrom,Timothy C. Berkelbach*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Introduce a new orbital-based size-consistent matrix interpolation (OSMI) formalism for constructing correlation functionals in DFT. The method combines nonempirical adiabatic connection with a one-parameter strong-interaction limit functional. It accurately predicts correlation energies and barrier heights, outperforming MP2 and other functionals. Also, OSMI improves fractional spin and charge errors for bond dissociation curves compared to DFT and MP2. The method appears promising for studying heterogeneous chemical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate and reliable density functional theory (DFT) methods remains a key challenge in computational chemistry. This paper addresses the issue of constructing size-consistent and orbital-invariant correlation functionals, which are crucial for accurate predictions of various molecular properties.

Method: The authors propose a novel formalism called OSMI, which constructs correlation energy matrices for the weak and strong correlation limits in the space of occupied orbitals. This method avoids previous difficulties in constructing size-consistent adiabatic connection functionals. A simple, nonempirical adiabatic connection functional and a one-parameter strong-interaction limit functional are designed and combined to form the OSMI method.

Result: The OSMI method demonstrates excellent performance in predicting correlation energies, with accurate results over a wide range of densities. When tested on the GMTKN55 thermochemistry database, OSMI outperforms MP2 and nonempirical density functionals in terms of average accuracy. Notably, it provides excellent predictions of barrier heights, with average errors of less than 2 kcal mol$^{-1}$. Additionally, OSMI shows a favorable trade-off between fractional spin and fractional charge errors for bond dissociation curves compared to DFT and MP2.

Conclusion: The development of the OSMI formalism represents a significant advancement in constructing accurate and reliable correlation functionals for DFT. Its success in predicting molecular properties and its favorable performance in various benchmarks suggest its potential as a valuable tool for studying a wide range of chemical systems, particularly heterogeneous ones.

Abstract: We introduce a size-consistent and orbital-invariant formalism for
constructing correlation functionals based on the adiabatic connection for
density functional theory (DFT). By constructing correlation energy matrices
for the weak and strong correlation limits in the space of occupied orbitals,
our method, which we call orbital-based size-consistent matrix interpolation
(OSMI), avoids previous difficulties in the construction of size-consistent
adiabatic connection functionals. We design a simple, nonempirical adiabatic
connection and a one-parameter strong-interaction limit functional, and we show
that the resulting method reproduces the correlation energy of the uniform
electron gas over a wide range of densities. When applied to subsets of the
GMTKN55 thermochemistry database, OSMI is more accurate on average than MP2 and
nonempirical density functionals. Most notably, OSMI provides excellent
predictions of the barrier heights we tested, with average errors of less than
2 kcal mol$^{-1}$. Finally, we find that OSMI improves the trade-off between
fractional spin and fractional charge errors for bond dissociation curves
compared to DFT and MP2. The fact that OSMI provides a good description of
molecular systems and the uniform electron gas, while also maintaining low
self-interaction error and size-consistency, suggests that it could provide a
framework for studying heterogeneous chemical systems.

*Visagan Ravindran,Clio Johnson,Neil D. Drummond,Stewart J. Clark,Nikitas. I. Gidopoulos*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper compares QMC-KS potentials with popular DFAs, highlighting similarities in electron densities and discrepancies in exchange-correlation contributions. The QMC-KS gap is generally larger than DFAs, except for Hartree-Fock, with gaps sensitive to semicore state inclusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between QMC methods and traditional DFAs is crucial for advancing electronic structure calculations and materials science.

Method: The study uses the Hollins et al. KS inversion method to benchmark QMC-derived potentials against DFAs.

Result: QMC potentials differ significantly from DFAs despite their use for the same electron densities. The KS gap with QMC includes semicore states and tends to be larger.

Conclusion: QMC-KS may be more reliable than DFAs due to reduced KS gaps, but caution is warranted for semicore state considerations when comparing with experiments.

Abstract: Using the Kohn-Sham (KS) inversion method of Hollins et al. [J. Phys.:
Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert densities from variational and
diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations to obtain benchmark QMC-KS
potentials for a range of insulators and semiconductors, which we then compare
to the KS potentials of popular density functional approximations (DFAs). Our
results show that different DFAs yield similar electron densities, despite
differences in their KS potentials, which originate primarily from the exchange
and correlation contribution. We also find that the KS gap from the QMC density
is typically larger than the KS gaps of most DFAs, with the exception of
Hartree-Fock. Finally, the KS gap is sensitive to the inclusion of semicore
states in the pseudopotentials, such that comparison with experiment should be
done with caution.

*Matisse Wei-Yuan Tu,E. K. U. Gross*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR:  paper introduces a novel perturbation method for studying electron-nuclear correlation beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, proving the method's validity and demonstrating its ability to capture deviations from the Berry phase in Jahn-Teller systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying electron-nuclear correlation effects in quantum systems is crucial for understanding phenomena like the Berry phase and nonadiabatic dynamics, which have wide-ranging implications in chemistry and materials science.

Method:  nonadiabatic perturbation theory (NAPT) is developed within the exact factorisation framework, treating the small mass ratio between electrons and nuclei as a perturbation to derive equations of motion for the system. The method ensures that key properties, such as normalization and gauge covariance, are preserved to any finite order.

Result:  the numerical results obtained with NAPT at the lowest order accurately describe the departure of the Berry phase from its topological value in systems with conical intersections. This approach leads to a correct scaling of the Berry phase towards zero when the conical intersection is smoothly removed.

Conclusion:  the presented NAPT provides a reliable theoretical framework for analyzing nonadiabatic effects in strongly correlated systems, particularly useful in scenarios involving conical intersections and the Berry phase.

Abstract: We present a novel nonadiabatic perturbation theory (NAPT) for correlated
systems of electrons and nuclei beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation.
The essence of the method is to exploit the smallness of the
electronic-to-nuclear mass ratio by treating the electron-nuclear correlation
terms in the electronic equation of motion of the exact factorisation (EF)
framework as perturbation. We prove that any finite-order truncation of the
NAPT preserves the normalisation of the conditional electronic factor as well
as the gauge covariance of the resulting perturbative equations of motion. We
illustrate the usefulness of NAPT by obtaining nonadiabatic corrections to the
BO Berry phase in Jahn--Teller systems with a conical intersection. It well
captures the departure of the exact Berry phase from being topological via the
lowest-order NAPT. By removing the conical intersection with a constant gap, it
further yields the correct scaling of the Berry phase toward zero.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing NMR and MRI diffusion experimental data relies on the
theoretical expression used for signal attenuation or phase evolution. In a
complex system, the encountered magnetic field is often inhomogeneous, which
may be represented by a linear combination of z^n gradient fields, where n is
the order. Additionally, the higher the order of the nonlinear gradient field,
the more sensitive the phase variances are to differences in diffusion
coefficients and delay times. Hence, studying higher-order fields has both
theoretical and experimental importance, but this is a challenge for
traditional methods. The recently proposed phase diffusion method proposed a
general way to overcome the challenge. This method is used and demonstrated in
detail in this paper to determine the phase evolution in a quadric field (n =
4). Three different types of phase evolution in the quadric gradient field are
obtained. Moreover, a general signal attenuation expression is proposed to
describe the signal attenuation for spin diffusion from the origin of the
nonlinear gradient field. This approximation is based on the short gradient
pulse (SGP) approximation but is extended to include the finite gradient pulse
width (FGPW) effect by using the mean square phase. Compared to other forms of
signal attenuation, such as Gaussian and Lorentzian, this method covers a
broader range of attenuation, from small to relatively large. Additionally,
this attenuation is easier to understand than the Mittag-Leffler function-based
attenuation. The results, particularly the phase and signal attenuation
expressions obtained in this paper, potentially advance PFG diffusion research
in nonlinear gradient fields in NMR and MRI.

Abstract: Polarizable Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) approaches based on
fluctuating charges and dipoles (QM/FQ(F$\mu$)) are formulated within the
state-specific Vertical Excitation Model (VEM) to compute vertical excitation
energies of solvated systems. This methodology overcomes the limitations of the
widely used Linear Response (LR) approach. While LR can capture the dynamic
response of the solvent to the QM transition density, it neglects the solvent
reorganization that follows solute relaxation upon electronic excitation. In
contrast, the VEM framework explicitly accounts for this effect. Benchmark
calculations of vertical excitation energies using QM/FQ(F$\mu$) are reported
for a representative set of solutes - acrolein, acetone, caffeine,
p-nitroaniline, coumarin 153, doxorubicin, and betaine-30 - comparing VEM with
LR, corrected LR (cLR), and cLR 2 schemes. The results reveal notable
variations in solvent response depending on the character of the electronic
transition and demonstrate that optimal accuracy can be achieved by selecting
the most appropriate model for each specific system and excitation.

Abstract: Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to
an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis
revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar
(C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier
($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$
center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique
kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces
an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply
contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$
rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble
averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion
permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis
and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor,
providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and
achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.

Abstract: Hybrid nanostructures that combine semiconducting and metallic components
offer great potential for photothermal therapy, optoelectronics, and sensing,
by integrating tunable optical properties with enhanced light absorption and
charge transport. Boosting the integrated performance of these hybrid systems
demands techniques capable of probing local variations of the physical
properties inaccessible to bulk analysis. Here, we report the single-particle
dielectric characterization of hybrid, semiconducting bismuth sulfide
(Bi$_2$S$_3$) nanorods (NR) decorated with metallic Au nanoparticles (NP),
employing scanning dielectric microscopy, which uses electrostatic force
microscopy in combination with finite-element numerical simulations. We reveal
a pronounced enhancement in the local dielectric response of Bi$_2$S$_3$ upon
Au decoration, attributed to interfacial polarization and electron transfer
from Au to the Bi$_2$S$_3$ matrix, thus suggesting a
semiconductor-to-metal-like transition at the single-particle level. Numerical
simulations show that the response is dominated by the vertical component of
the permittivity and that the decorating metallic Au NP produce only moderate
shielding of the semiconductor Bi$_2$S$_3$ NR core, indicating that the large
increase in the dielectric response originates primarily from intrinsic
modifications within the NR. Overall, these findings provide direct insight
into structure--property relationships at the single-particle level, supporting
the rational design of advanced hybrid nanostructures with tailored electronic
functionalities.

Abstract: Atom-centered electric multipole moments can be extremely useful in chemistry
as they enable the systematic mapping of a complex electrostatic problem to a
simpler model. However, since they do not correspond to physical observables,
there is no unique way to define them. In this work, we present an extension of
the dynamically generated RESP charges (D-RESP) method, referred to as xDRESP,
where atom-centered multipoles are computed from mixed quantum
mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations. We
compare the ability of xDRESP charges to reproduce the electrostatic potential,
as well as molecular multipoles, against the performance of fixed point-charge
models commonly used in force fields. Moreover, we highlight cases where DRESP
atomic multipoles can provide valuable information about chemical systems, such
as indicating when polarization plays a significant role, and chemical
reactions, in which xDRESP atomic multipoles can be used as an on-the-fly
analysis tool to track changes in electron density.

Abstract: We present a multiscale quantum mechanics/classical (QM/MM) approach for
modeling surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectra of molecules
adsorbed on plasmonic nanostructures. The molecular subsystem is described at
the density functional theory (DFT) level, while the plasmonic material is
represented using fully atomistic, frequency-dependent Fluctuating Charges
($\omega$FQ) and Fluctuating Charges and Dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models.
These schemes enable an accurate and computationally efficient description of
the plasmonic response of both graphene-based materials and noble metal
nanostructures, achieving accuracy comparable to ab initio methods. The
proposed methodology is applied to the calculation of SEIRA spectra of adenine
adsorbed on gold nanoparticles and graphene sheets. The quality and robustness
of the approach are assessed through comparison with surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) spectra and available experimental data. The results
demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a reliable route to simulate
vibrational responses of plasmon-molecule hybrid systems.

Motivation: 该研究旨在探索强相互作用系统的行为，尤其是在$d = z+1$的空间维度下，寻找Tau Quark的临界行为。

Method: 通过引入带有$a_{ij}$相互作用的矩阵玻色子，并分别在$a_{ij}$和$a_{ij}$较强的情况下，研究了电子和玻色子的自能。

Abstract: We propose a model of metallic critical point which we study at $T=0$ in the
large-$N$ limit. We start with two species of fermions $c_i, f_i$, each with
$N$ flavors and matrix bosons $b_{ij}$ with $N^2$ components. They interact
with each other via slave-boson like interaction $\int b_{ij}^{\dagger} \,
c_i^{\dagger}f_j$. The bosons have a bare dispersion of
$\varepsilon_{\textbf{q}}^b = \lambda_z |\textbf{q}|^z$ and we study the
problem in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show that for $d = z+1,$ the electronic
self energy shows marginal Fermi liquid behavior. We first evaluate the
fermionic self energy $\Sigma(i\omega)$ using the standard approximate boson
self energy $\Pi(\textbf{q}, i\nu) \propto |\nu|/|\textbf{q}|$ and find that
$\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$ which shows a much weaker
dependence on $N$ when compared with similar results from non-SYK large-$N$
Ising-nematic models. Then we evaluate $\Sigma(i\omega)$ again using a more
precise form of $\Pi$ which allows us to study the interplay between $N
\rightarrow \infty$ limit for which $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega
\ln(1/|\omega|)$, and the $\omega \rightarrow 0$ limit where we recover
$\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$. We also use the full bosonic
self energy to obtain the correction to the bosonic specific heat as
$\frac{T}{N} \ln(1/T)$. Since there are $N^2$ bosons and $N$ fermions, the bulk
heat capacity for both fermions and bosons show nearly similar functional form
$NVT \ln(N/T)$ and $NVT \ln(1/T)$ respectively for $T \rightarrow 0$.

Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with band structure
calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide
NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, there are conflicting
conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in
NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of
single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant
photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in
NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is
quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states
and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS
spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the
experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that
NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The
same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known
strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV
and $\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for
NiTe$_2$$<$NiO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in
NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO is not due to an increase in $T_{eg}$.
The increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron
is attributed to negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$. However, since
$U_{dd}$$>$$|\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite
repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac
semi-metal.

Conclusion: Hatsugai-Kohmoto模型可以有效地作为许多体近似方法的基准，有助于更深入地理解$GW$方法在强关联环境中的性能。

Abstract: The accurate simulation of strongly correlated electron systems remains a
central challenge in condensed matter physics, motivating the development of
various non-perturbative many-body methods. Such methods are typically
benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem
and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these
issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a
benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$,
and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response
functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our
analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for
describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch
that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a
covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of
charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our
work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body
approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly
correlated regimes.

Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,
in which the electron hopping amplitude is modulated by the difference between
neighboring phonon coordinates. Using sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum
Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis, we determine the
long-range ordered phases as a function of the electron-phonon coupling and
phonon frequency. By examining both adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, we
reveal the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases,
as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. In addition, finite-temperature
simulations show that the VBS transition occurs at critical temperatures
significantly higher than in models with local electron-phonon coupling,
consistent with the presence of lighter polarons in the metallic regime. These
findings establish the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of
the optical SSH model, which emphasize its similarities and contrasts with
other electron-phonon systems.

these solutions come from multiple back-reacted M2-M5 spikes, and that
different values of $\gamma$ correspond to different scaling limits of the same
M2-M5 solutions. We find that when $\gamma$ switches from positive to negative,
the infrared region of the AdS$_3$ switches from the tip of spikes, far from
the M5 branes, to the bottom of the spikes, far from the M2 branes. We also
explain how the bubbling negative-$\gamma$ solutions emerge from the geometric

Abstract: We construct $AdS_3\times Y_7$ solutions of type IIB supergravity, where
$Y_7$ is a smooth $S^5$ bundle over a spindle $\Sigma(n_N,n_S)$, which are dual
to $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ SCFTs in $d=2$. The solutions are constructed using the
$D=5$ STU $U(1)^3$ gauged supergravity theory coupled to a hyperscalar charged
under $U(1)_B$. We investigate spindle solutions with two new features: first,
we allow $(n_N,n_S)$ to be non-coprime integers, including orbifolds of the
round $S^2$, which can lead to non-unique, inequivalent uplifts, distinguished
by the hyperscalar spectra, for given magnetic flux through the spindle.
Second, we also allow the hyperscalar to vanish at the poles leading to
solutions carrying non-vanishing $U(1)_B$ flux. The new hyperscalar $AdS_3$
solutions can naturally arise as the endpoint of RG flows, triggered by
relevant hyperscalar deformations of the $AdS_3$ solutions of the STU model.

Abstract: A bosonic non-invertible Symmetry Protected Topological (NISPT) phase in
(1+1)-dim is referred to as $\textit{intrinsic}$ if it cannot be mapped, under
discrete gauging, to a gapped phase with any invertible symmetry, that is, if
it is protected by a non-group-theoretical fusion category symmetry. We
construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a
partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed
anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively
understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is
the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous
categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT
(igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is
non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide
two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT
phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT
phases to (3+1)-dim.

Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry has emerged in recent years as a practical
quantity to study phases of matter. We present the first study of entanglement
asymmetry in gauge theories by considering the chiral anomaly of the
analytically solvable massless Schwinger model at both zero and finite
temperatures. At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic
growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is
parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the
corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays
exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes
the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature)
phase transitions in gauge theories.

Method:  employ group theory and algebraic geometry to analyze the moduli spaces and symmetry categories of 3d $	ext{N} = 5$ SCFTs with various gauge groups and levels. obtained explicit descriptions of the moduli spaces by constructing central extensions of quaternionic reflection groups and determining the generators corresponding to specific symmetries. validated the results by comparing Hilbert series with superconformal index limits and exploring the implications of 't Hooft anomalies. conducted a thorough analysis of the symmetry web for different gauge groups and levels, particularly focusing on cases with opposite parities of $N$ and $k$ and unequal ranks.

Result: Main results include: (1) the moduli spaces of 3d $	ext{N}=5$ SCFTs are controlled by central extensions of quaternionic reflection groups, with specific generators identified; (2) a systematic method is developed to construct the governing group of a theory obtained by gauging a $	ext{Z}_2$ zero-form symmetry, involving the addition of a particular generator; (3) Hilbert series calculations match the limits of the superconformal index for all cases analyzed; (4) 't Hooft anomalies for zero-form symmetries are clearly reflected in both the superconformal index and the geometry of the moduli space; (5) the symmetry category of $	ext{so}(2N)_{2k} 	imes 	ext{usp}(2N)_{-k}$ theories remains $D_8$ for all $N$ and $k$, though details of the symmetry web differ based on their parity; (6) theories with unequal ranks or $	ext{so}(2N+1)$ gauge algebras have distinct symmetry structures, with two SCFT variants based on $F(4)$.

Conclusion: The research provides a comprehensive understanding of the moduli spaces and symmetry categories of 3d $	ext{N}=5$ superconformal field theories with various gauge groups and levels. The methods developed offer a powerful tool for analyzing similar structures in other dimensions and theories, and the results deepen our knowledge of the relationship between symmetry, anomalies, and the geometry of the moduli space in high-energy physics.

Abstract: The moduli space and generalised global symmetries of 3d $\mathcal{N} = 5$
superconformal field theories are investigated, with a focus on the
orthosymplectic ABJ theories and their discrete gauging variants. We extend the
known classification of $\mathcal{N}=5$ moduli spaces as orbifolds
$\mathbb{H}^{2N}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a quaternionic reflection group, to
theories incorporating $\mathrm{Spin}$, $\mathrm{O}^-$, and $\mathrm{Pin}$-type
gauge groups. In these cases, we find that the moduli space is governed not by
$\Gamma$ itself, but by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central extension thereof, for which
we explicitly describe the generators. We provide a systematic method to
construct the group $\Gamma'$ governing the moduli space of a theory
$\mathcal{T}'$ obtained by gauging a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ zero-form symmetry of an
original theory $\mathcal{T}$. This is achieved by identifying the specific
generator that must be added to $\Gamma$. We compute the Hilbert series for
these moduli spaces and verify them against the corresponding limits of the
superconformal index, finding perfect agreement. We also discuss how 't Hooft
anomalies for the zero-form symmetries manifest in the superconformal index and
the moduli space. Furthermore, we revisit the symmetry category of the
$\mathfrak{so}(2N)_{2k} \times \mathfrak{usp}(2N)_{-k}$ theories. We extend
previous analyses to the case where $N$ and $k$ have opposite parities, finding
that the symmetry category remains $D_8$; however, the details of the symmetry
web differ. Finally, we analyse theories with unequal ranks, those containing
the $\mathfrak{so}(2N+1)$ gauge algebra, and the two SCFT variants based on the
$F(4)$ superalgebra.

Abstract: The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) is examined to
four-loop order in scalar-fermion systems in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$
dimensions. The crucial role played by the beta shift, which is a modification
of the standard dim-reg beta function, is elucidated, and specific conditions
that it needs to satisfy for the RG flow to be gradient are derived. Over a
thousand gradient-flow conditions are found, all of which are
scheme-independent and satisfied whenever the full set of results needed to
check them is available. It is shown, in the framework of the $\varepsilon=4-d$
expansion, that the space of conformal field theories (CFTs) is dominated by
those with non-zero beta shift as the number of fields grows. Physical
properties of CFTs obtained as solutions where the beta functions are not zero
in the $\varepsilon$ expansion are discussed.

Abstract: We consider near-extremal membranes embedded in M-theory, consistently
truncated to gauged $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity in four dimensions on the
coset space $M^{1,1,0}$. These are holographically dual to $2 + 1$ dimensional
superconformal gauge theory with $U(1)_R \times U(1)_B$ global symmetry.
Turning on the chemical potential to either the $R$-symmetry or the baryonic
symmetry gives access to the quantum critical regime of the boundary gauge
theory. We study perturbative stability of the extremal limit, and demonstrate
that membranes with topological (baryonic) charge are free from all known
instabilities. $R$-charged membranes are free from the superconducting
instabilities, but have unstable charge transport and instabilities associated
with the condensation of the axions.

Abstract: The strong coupling regime of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric vacua of

Abstract: We study a single-sided black hole with an end-of-the-world (EoW) brane
behind horizon in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. The new Hamiltonian is a
deformation of the original DSSYK Hamiltonian with an additional exponential
wormhole length operator, which leads to a new chord diagram rule. The boundary
algebra is defined as generated by the new Hamiltonian and boundary matter,
analogous to the original DSSYK. There is an alternative definition with a
$q$-coherent state, which can be shown to be equivalent to the former by a
nontrivial isomorphism of the von Neumann algebra of DSSYK. This isomorphism
induces an unitary equivalence, which yields a surprising result that the
boundary algebra of a single-sided black hole in DSSYK has a non-trivial
commutant and is still a type $\text{II}_1$ von Neumann factor. It follows that
the full bulk reconstruction from the boundary is impossible, and we
demonstrate that the non-trivial commutant leads to the existence of a ``no
man's island" behind the horizon in the semiclassical JT gravity limit. We take
a few different ways to understand the nontrivial commutant of the boundary
algebra of a single-sided black hole. We show that the commutant is indeed
non-geometric in the sense of being complex on chord number basis. In the
semiclassical JT limit, the commutant becomes the canonical purification of the
boundary algebra and claims the no man's island. Comparing with the Hawking
radiation process after Page time, the unitary equivalence can be interpreted
as the encoding map from the canonical purification to the old Hawking
radiation, and thus the no man's island has the same essence as the island. We
also show an extension of the boundary algebra to all bounded operators by
including an additional exponential wormhole length operator.

Abstract: The modern way to understand symmetries of a quantum field theory is via its
topological defects in various dimensions. In this contribution to the
proceedings we focus on line defects in 2d QFT and we point out that
topological defects naturally embed into a larger class, namely translation
invariant defects. The latter still allow for non-singular fusion and one
obtains a monoidal category of translation invariant defects which contains
that of topological defects as a full subcategory. We give a simple
perturbative description of translation invariant defects in a perturbed
conformal field theory via chiral three-dimensional topological field theory.
We show in the example of the Ising CFT and the Lee-Yang CFT that even if no
topological defects survive the deformation, some translation invariant defects
still do.

Supports cosmological toy model of baryogenesis and discusses applications to Weyl/Dirac semimetals and the Strong-CP problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper contributes to understanding the effective actions of coupled fermions and backgrounds, addressing the stability and vacuum effects in such systems. The results have implications for cosmological processes and condensed matter systems involving axial fields.

Method: Performs a controlled quasi-static approximation, derives the Hessian functional, diagonalizes it to delineate parameter spaces, and computes nonperturbative pair-production rates from the effective action. Investigates chiral anomaly and instanton-like configurations in unified framework.

Result: The study finds a broad parameter space with distinct stability sectors, including propagating axial fields and chirality-asymmetric instabilities. Nonperturbative pair-production rates exhibit pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to prior results. A unified derivation of chiral anomaly structures is achieved, and instanton-like axial configurations are identified even when the axial field is non-gauge. A cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by axial vector is validated. Implications for Weyl/Dirac semimetals and applications to the Strong-CP problem are discussed.

Conclusion: This paper significantly advances the understanding of Euler-Heisenberg effective actions for coupled fermions and backgrounds. The identified stability sectors, axial field regimes, and novel pair-production rates provide a foundation for exploring axion-based cosmological processes and applications in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for
Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and
massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static
approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we
systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors
characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify
subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a
broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes;
strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This
addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature,
diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we
derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously
propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find
pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral
anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic
coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when
it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a
cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing
numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis.
Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and
briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the
Strong-CP problem.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of a non-perturbative
formulation of string theory. In this theory, the ``classical'' action is
almost uniquely determined by T-symmetry, which is a generalization of the
T-duality, where the parameter of ``quantum'' corrections $\beta$ in the
path-integral of the theory is independent of that of quantum corrections
$\hbar$ in the perturbative string theories. We distinguish the effects of
$\beta$ and $\hbar$ by putting " " like "classical" and "loops" for tree level
and loop corrections with respect to $\beta$, respectively, whereas by putting
nothing like classical and loops for tree level and loop corrections with
respect to $\hbar$, respectively. A non-renormalization theorem states that
there is no ``loop'' correction. Thus, there is no problem of
non-renormalizability, although the theory is defined by the path-integral over
the fields including a metric on string geometry. No ``loop'' correction is
also the reason why the complete path-integrals of the all-order perturbative
strings in general string backgrounds are derived from the ``tree''-level
two-point correlation functions in the perturbative vacua, although string
geometry includes information of genera of the world-sheets of the stings.
Furthermore, a non-perturbative correction in string coupling with the order
$e^{-1/g_s^2}$ is given by a transition amplitude representing a tunneling
process between the semi-stable vacua in the ``classical'' potential by an
``instanton'' in the theory. From this effect, a generic initial state will
reach the minimum of the potential.

Abstract: We consider the general asymptotically flat, doubly-rotating, three-charge

supergravity. We construct a null-gauged WZW model whose target-space geometry
reproduces this background in the NS5 decoupling limit, and show that the
gauging parameters precisely satisfy the appropriate consistency conditions on
the perturbative string spectrum. Through an analytic continuation and an
appropriate limit, this model relates to a recently studied construction
describing strings on smooth, horizonless geometries. We further analyze the
supersymmetric and extremal three-charge configuration, corresponding to the
ten-dimensional uplift of the (NS5-decoupled) BMPV black hole, and show that it
requires a novel class of null-gauged WZW models. Our construction provides
explicit examples of worldsheet CFTs that capture string dynamics on certain
black hole geometries with linear dilaton asymptotics.

and the $a$-theorem. Using field multiplicities as free parameters, we find all
superconformal fixed points and classify theories according to their phase
diagrams. Highlights include asymptotically free theories displaying a range of
interacting fixed points in the IR, asymptotically non-free theories that
become asymptotically safe due to residual interactions, UV-complete theories
with gauge sectors that are simultaneously UV-free and IR-free, and theories
that remain interacting both in the asymptotic UV and IR. Estimates for the
sizes of conformal windows are also provided, and implications for model
building are discussed.

Motivation: 这项研究的动机是探索超对称解及其在不同维度上的截断，特别是在$d=6$时，试图理解其内部几何和物理性质。

Method: 主要使用的数学工具包括双旋量和G结构理论。研究者通过分析$d=6$超重力的理论框架，结合截断条件来找出满足要求的解。

Result: 研究得出，在没有R对称性_case和一个单U(1)等距的情况下，嵌入流形分为两类。这类流形其中之一由类似于Toda的方程控制，并且至少有一类受限的嵌入。当没有张量多重器时，嵌入类更加宽松，但涉及的偏微分方程（PDEs）变得更为复杂。

Conclusion: 综上所述，使用双体和G结构方法，研究者分类了$d=6$超重力的相容截断，显示在缺少张量多重器时，嵌入流形的范围变得更加广泛，但获得这些解的难度也有所增加。在R对称性背景下的几何结构则表现出独特的非Minkowski和非AdS特征。

Abstract: Bi-spinor and G-structure methods are used to classify the possible
consistent truncations of type II supergravity to $d=6$ Einstein-Maxwell
(gauged) supergravity, and its consistent sub-sectors. In the absence of
R-symmetry gauging and a tensor multiplet we establish that every
supersymmetric Mink$_6$ solution defines an embedding of the $d=6$ theory.
Adding a tensor multiplet places restrictions on these embeddings, but
embeddings still exist. In the presence of R-symmetry gauging the internal
spaces of the embeddings are neither related to Mink$_6$ or AdS$_6$. Under the
assumption that the internal space contains a single U(1) isometry housing the
$d=6$ gauge field we classify the possible embedding manifolds. We find two
classes of embedding for the entire theory, one of which is governed by a
Toda-like equation and contains at least one bounded embedding. In the absence
of a tensor multiple the classes of embeddings become more permissive, though
the PDEs governing them become more complicated in general.
