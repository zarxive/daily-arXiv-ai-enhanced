This is of\nparticular interest in combination with modern artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning techniques, which are increasingly used to develop\nphysics-informed and data-driven foundation models for atomistic simulations.\nThese models aim to provide transferable, high-accuracy representations of\natomic interactions that are applicable across diverse sets of molecular\nsystems, which requires accurate treatment of long-range charge interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5177\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u7535\u52bf\u7684\u67d4\u6027\u591a\u6781\u7535\u8377\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u591a\u6781\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f20\u7edf\u5f71\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u7f51\u7edc\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5efa\u6a21\u6b63\u5728\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u7535\u52bf\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u67d4\u6027\u591a\u6781\u7535\u8377\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5904\u7406\u957f\u7a0b\u7535\u52bf\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6781\u7535\u8377\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u591a\u6781\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u9759\u7535\u52bf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u591a\u6781\u7535\u8377\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3001\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The\npaper first establishes an abstract model of the beam tracking application\nscenario and introduces the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) employed\nin this paper. Subsequently, simulations are conducted to compare the\nconventional direct beam switching method with the proposed row-by-row\nswitching code table approach, thereby elucidating the advantages and\nlimitations of the new method. In parallel, a RIS hardware platform is\nconstructed in a microwave anechoic chamber for experimental validation.

Separately, materials science and\ncommunications rely on the ability to temporally shape the evolution of\nelectromagnetic pulses. In this work we investigate theoretically the\npropagation of ultrafast pulses inside hyperbolic metamaterials-based photonic\nfunnels, which have been recently used to achieve deep subwavelength\n(wavelength/30) concentration of monochromatic mid-infrared light. By analyzing\nthe complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the pulse-funnel interaction, we show\nthat photonic funnels, in general, broaden bandwidth-limited ultrafast Gaussian\npulses.

We map lattice parameters and\ntemperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe\nacross the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature\nsensitivity is 2.2 K/$\\sqrt{Hz}$.

Continuous-in-time measurements provide the\nmissing theoretical framework to make sense of such observables.

The\nSeebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly\nenhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier\nconcentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering.\nWe discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies,\nand suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to\nincrease the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW\npicture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Sn-substitution\u5bf9\u83f1\u67f1\u72b6Co2O3\u5316\u5408\u7269\u70ed\u7535\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u7535 resistivity\u548c Seebeck \u7cfb\u6570\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u3002Sn\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269\u7684\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u4f7f\u77ed\u7a0b\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\uff08SDW\uff09\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u6e29\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6742\u8d28\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684SDW\u6709\u5e8f\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f/\u6742\u8d28\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6709\u5e8f\u3002\u89c1beck\u7cfb\u6570\u4e0e\u8fd9\u79cd\u6742\u8d28\u6548\u5e94\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u8d77\u59cb\u6e29\u5ea6\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u56e0SDW\u6709\u5e8f\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f2a\u80fd\u9699\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u5173\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u66ff\u6362\u6548\u5e94\u7684Detailed\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5bfc\u7535\u7684CoO2\u5c42\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u8d77\u59cb\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8e\u5bfc\u7535\u7684CoO2\u5c42...\u201d...]", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76Sn-substitution\u5bf9\u83f1\u67f1\u72b6Co2O3\u5316\u5408\u7269\u70ed\u7535\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u6c42\u957f range\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5bfc\u7535\u5c42\u548c\u6742\u539f\u5b50\u5c42\u53d6\u4ee3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u4f20\u70ed\u548c\u7535\u4f20\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u3001 Seebeck \u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u70ed\u7535\u5076\u7279\u6027\u7b49\u3002", "result": "1.\u83f1\u67f1\u72b6Co2O3\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u77ed\u7a0b\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u6709\u5e8f\u8d77\u59cb\u6e29\u5ea6\u968fSn\u66ff\u4ee3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u6742\u8d28\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684SDW\u6709\u5e8f\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f/\u6742\u8d28\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6709\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7Sn-substitution\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u83f1\u67f1\u72b6Co2O3\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u70ed\u7535\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7535\u70ed\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002Our\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u5230\u5bfc\u7535\u7684CoO2\u5c42\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d77\u59cb\u6e29\u5ea6\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0eSDW\u6709\u5e8f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u5173\u3002)"}}

This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable\ncomb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or\ntriangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope\ninfrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that\napproaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one\nyear of integration.

The design is intended to surpass the cosmic microwave background constraints on gravitational wave backgrounds.

Overcoming the BBN bound requires a sensitive detector system. A promising approach is to use closed optical loops that amplify gravitational wave-induced phase shifts over multiple traversals. Such systems can produce sharp, narrowband resonances that can be detected and used to identify gravitational wave backgrounds. Detecting these high-frequency waves could provide unique insights into early universe physics, including high-energy density scenarios that might have occurred just after the big bang.", "method": "The research describes the design and sensitivity analysis of a loop interferometer architecture. The gravitational wave-induced phase shifts accumulate coherently over many traversals of the loop, enhancing the sensitivity of the system. The paper specifies that the design is compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, which is a large-scale, laser-interferometric gravitational wave detector. The finesse of the loops is set to approximately 500, allowing for finesse values that accumulate sufficient phase shifts to detect the desired gravitational waves. The researchers perform a projection of the sensitivity of this setup, estimating that it can approach and surpass the BBN sensitivity six orders of magnitude higher in frequency after approximately one year of operation.", "result": "Sensitivity projections indicate that a closed-loop system with loop parameters compatible with Einstein Telescope infrastructure, such as finesse around 500 for square or triangular loops, can detect a stochastic gravitational wave background near or beyond the BBN limit within a kilohertz of integration over a year. This result suggests that this new interferometric architecture is a feasible and high-performing method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves. The predictable comb structure of the resonances provides a distinct experimental signature, simplifying the detection of such weak signals. The coherence in phase shifts enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, exceeding the upper noise floor set by the cosmic microwave background and even surpassing it in some frequency bands.", "conclusion": "The proposed method using closed-loop interferometers offers a realistic approach to testing stochastic high-frequency gravitational waves. The sensitivity projections, especially considering Einstein Telescope infrastructure, demonstrate that the system can potentially surpass existing specially designed stochastic gravitational wave detectors. The predictable comb structure provides a clear signature, making this an efficient and reliable experimental design.

We provide detailed discussions of our numerical implementation and\ncomparisons with numerical relativity simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u81ea\u529b\u7ea7\u6570\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f merger Binary\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u81ea\u65cb Binary\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\u5230\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230 plunge \u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230 plunge \u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6fc0\u52b1\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba8\u8bba\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5c06\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8d28\u5f84\u6bd4\u7d27\u51d1\u53cc\u661f\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6fc0\u52b1\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u9762\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u529b\u7ea7\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u878d\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u7684 inspiral\u3001\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230 plunge \u4ee5\u53ca\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u632f\u8361\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e3b\u9ed1\u4f53\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\u5230transition-to-plunge \u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728transition\u5230 plunge\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6fc0\u52b1\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\u5230transition-to-plunge\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728transition\u5230 plunge\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6fc0\u52b1\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76 extends\u4e86\u81ea\u529b\u7ea7\u6570\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f merger Binary\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u81ea\u65cb Binary\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6fc0\u52b1\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e3b\u9ed1\u4f53\u81ea\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684-black hole\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address the challenge of array size\nscalability hindered by extensive DC control routing in 2-bit metasurfaces, we\npropose a novel RF-DC separation architecture. This approach integrates the\nmetasurface and DC control circuitry onto separate printed circuit boards\n(PCBs), interconnected via pin cascading, enabling theoretically unlimited\ntwo-dimensional array expansion.

Owing to spin-orbit coupling and buckling, the quantum\nvalley Hall effect in twisted bilayer silicene and germanene is more complex\nthan in twisted bilayer graphene. We found that there is a range of electric\nfields for which the spin degree of freedom is locked to the valley degree of\nfreedom of the electrons in the quantum valley Hall states, resulting in a\nstronger topological protection.

While electronic implementations of\nartificial spiking neurons have dominated to date, photonic approaches are\nattracting increasing research interest as they promise ultrafast,\nenergy-efficient operation with low-crosstalk and high bandwidth. Nevertheless,\nexisting photonic neurons largely mimic integrate-and-fire models, but\nneuroscience shows that neurons also encode information through richer\nmechanisms, such as the frequency and temporal patterns of spikes. Here, we\npresent a photonic-electronic resonate-and-fire (R-and-F) spiking neuron that\nresponds to the temporal structure of high-speed optical inputs. This is based\non a light-sensitive resonant tunnelling diode that produces excitable spikes\nin response to nanosecond, low-power (100 microwatt) optical signals at\ninfrared telecom wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate control of R-and-F\ndynamics through inter-pulse timing of the optical stimuli and applied bias\nvoltage, achieving bandpass filtering of both analogue and digital inputs.

Such adaptive control methods have been considered in\nsingle-parameter quantum metrology, but not much in multi-parameter quantum\nmetrology so far.

Our\nresults provide new insights and design principles for controlling current\nfluctuations in quantum devices operating beyond the standard weak-coupling\nparadigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u548c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bian\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u5750\u6807\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u7535\u6d41\u548c\u5176\u6ce2\u52a8\u5747\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf-\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u6d41\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u73af\u5883response\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u8df3\u8dc3\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u677e\u5f1b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u5750\u6807\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u64cd\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u975e\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u548c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bian\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5168\u8ba1\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u5750\u6807\u6620\u5c04\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u5747\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf-\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u6d41\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u73af\u5883response\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u8df3\u8dc3\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u548c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bian\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684current fluctuations\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9bnonclassical properties\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\ndiscuss and analyze in detail an alternative approach: the stepwise estimation\nstrategy. In this approach, parameters are estimated sequentially, using an\noptimized fraction of the total available resources allocated to each step. We\nderive a tight and achievable precision bound for this protocol, the stepwise\nseparable bound, and provide its closed-form analytical expression, revealing a\ncrucial dependence on the chosen measurement ordering. We provide a rigorous\ncomparison with the joint measurement strategy, deriving analytical conditions\nthat determine when the stepwise approach offers superior precision. Through\nthe analysis of several paradigmatic SU(2) unitary encoding models, we\ndemonstrate that the stepwise strategy can indeed outperform joint\nmeasurements, particularly in scenarios characterized by non-optimal probes or\nmodels with a high degree of sloppiness. Our findings establish stepwise\nestimation as a powerful alternative to joint and collective measurements,\nproving that sequential protocols can provide a genuine metrological advantage,\nespecially in resource-constrained or imperfect experimental settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
