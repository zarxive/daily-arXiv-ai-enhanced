Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $\u03c7^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u7acb\u6cf5 lasers\u5728\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u523b\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u82af\u7247\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6280\u672f\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u7acb\u6cf5\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u586b\u5145\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5728\u03c7^{(3)}\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u81ea\u9501\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u82af\u7247\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u523b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5149\u8c31\u5230\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7684\u5168\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u96f6\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u7531\u6cf5\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u5408\u6210\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u82af\u7247\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5149\u8c10\u632f\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These dynamics can often be extracted from a two-dimensional trace consisting of a set of nonlinear spectra, using an iterative algorithm. Typically, the measurement of this trace requires integrating the signal of many pulses, which implies that the trace does not correspond to a single pulse when shot-to-shot variations occur. In this case, the pulse train can be characterized statistically, by a base pulse and a metric that quantifies the instabilities. Here, we demonstrate that the amplitude swing technique is sensitive to instabilities, which manifest as two distinct imprints on the measurement. First, we analyze the terms that compose the amplitude swing signal.

Second, they map this theory onto a bosonic computational basis stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. They then implement this gauge theory using a single-species Bose-Hubbard model in a tilted optical superlattice, which is a common setup in cold-atom physics. The use of quantum Zeno dynamics ensures that the system's dynamics are governed by the desired gauge theory while maintaining the necessary constraints. Finally, the authors employ infinite matrix product state simulations to benchmark the real-time dynamics of the system under global quenches, verifying the accuracy and robustness of the proposed implementation.", "result": "The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed cold-atom quantum simulator successfully exhibits the expected behavior of a (2+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory with spin S=1 truncation. Under global quenches, the simulator faithfully evolves the target gauge theory, and the gauge constraints are preserved robustly. The use of an infinite matrix product state approach allows for accurate benchmarking of the system's real-time dynamics, confirming the validity of the proposed implementation. These findings significantly advance the field by showing that larger gauge-field truncations, which were previously restricted, can now be realized in current ultracold-atom platforms. The work opens new possibilities for studying higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories and their applications in quantum chromodynamics and related areas.", "conclusion": "This paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of quantum simulation by demonstrating a feasible and practical implementation of a (2+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory using cold atoms. The proposed approach based on a Bose-Hubbard model in a tilted optical superlattice, combined with quantum Zeno dynamics, provides a robust framework for simulating higher-dimensional gauge theories with larger truncations than previously possible. The benchmarking via infinite matrix product state simulations successfully validates the implementation and its ability to preserve gauge constraints under global quenches. This work not only advances the experimental capabilities in lattice gauge theory simulation but also sets a foundation for future studies in quantum chromodynamics and other complex quantum field theories."}}

For static geometries, Bao et al. established that this cone is polyhedral by constructing a graph model from Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces on a time-symmetric slice. Extending this framework to general, time-dependent states governed by the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) formula has remained an open problem, as the relevant extremal surfaces do not lie on a common spatial slice. We resolve this by constructing a graph model directly from the causal structure of entanglement wedges. By proving a key \"no-short-cut\" theorem, we show that minimization over graph cuts reduces to a consideration of cuts corresponding to unions of complete HRT surfaces, establishing the equivalence of the covariant and static holographic entropy cones.

Our insight is that some of the fault space can be sampled efficiently, after which extrapolation is sufficient to complete the testing task. As a result, our tool scales to distance 17 for a physical error rate of 0.0005 with a two-hour time budget on a desktop.

Here we show that a response-based diagnostic of effective non-Hermiticity can be formulated using minimal pseudo-Lorentz-symmetry-breaking deformations, which separate observables that remain captured by parameter redefinitions from those that exhibit irreducible NH structure. For a two-dimensional NH Dirac semimetal in the weak-NH, real-spectrum regime, we analyze Dirac-cone tilt and velocity anisotropy and compute representative probes of spectral structure, quantum geometry, optical response, and viscoelasticity at zero temperature. We find that tilt yields an NH-dependent slope of the density of states that cannot be collapsed to a single effective velocity, while velocity anisotropy can be captured by effective-velocity reparametrization. Furthermore, the quantum metric and collisionless optical conductivities provide NH-insensitive benchmarks (with the nonlinear conductivity symmetry selected), whereas the shear viscosity offers a discriminator through its tensor structure.

By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u4e49\u5316\u7684Luther-Emery\u6db2\u6001\u76f8\uff0c\u7531\u4e0d\u5171\u7528\u6392\u5217\u7684\u5bf9\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\uff08iC-PDW\uff09\u5173\u8054\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u817ft-J-J\u5782\u76f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u4e24\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7535\u52bf\u5dee\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e2d\u5c42\u6781\u5316P\u7684 regimes\u3002 Combining \u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\uff08DMRG\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u73bb\u8272\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6709\u9650P\u7684\u94c1\u78c1\u95f4\u9699\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5c42\u95f4\u548c\u5c42\u5185\u5bf9\u7535\u8377\u76f8\u5173\u90fd\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5468\u671f\u3002\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u73b0\u51faFFLO-like\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u7531\u5c42\u95f4\u5177\u4e0d\u540c\u8d39\u7c73\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5468\u671f\u7531\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u5dee\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u5c42\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u6e90\u4e8e\u5c42\u95f4\u7535\u8377\u4e0e\u76f8\u53cd\u5c42\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u52a8\u91cf\u7b49\u4e8e\u76f8\u53cd\u5c42\u7535\u8377\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002iC-PDW\u76f8\u5728\u8f83\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u63ba\u6742\u548c\u6781\u5316\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u90fd\u5f88\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u8df3\u8dc3\u6700\u7ec8\u4f7f\u5176\u5411\u5177\u67094e\u7535\u8377\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5931\u7a33\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8ba8\u8bba\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5149\u683c\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5c3cddenate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u5c42\u95f4\u6781\u5316\u548c\u914d\u5bf9\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u76f8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\uff08DMRG\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u73bb\u8272\u5316\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002DMRG\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e24\u5c42\u68af\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u73bb\u8272\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\uff0ciC-PDW\u76f8\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6392\u5217\u7684\u5bf9\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u5173\u8054\u3002\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u663e\u793aFFLO-like\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u800c\u5c42\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u6e90\u4e8e\u5c42\u95f4\u548c\u5c42\u5185\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u8026\u5408\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u76f8\u5728\u8f83\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u63ba\u6742\u548c\u6781\u5316\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5c42\u95f4\u8df3\u8dc3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176destabilization\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u76f8\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e3a\u5149\u683c\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

The effects of quantum fluctuations are described by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction terms in the extended coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The spatially uniform and inhomogeneous BEC cases are studied. In the first case, the parameter regimes associated with macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping, and revival-like localisation dynamics are found. The Josephson oscillation frequencies for both the zero-phase and the $\u03c0$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the dynamics exhibit a nontrivial bifurcation structure: along the zero-phase branch, two pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\u03c0$-phase branch shows a single pitchfork bifurcation. In the second case, the Josephson dynamics for quantum droplets and vortices are investigated. Predictions for the oscillation frequencies of the atomic population between quantum droplets are obtained and fully validated by direct numerical simulations of coupled extended GP equations. The existence of the Andreev-Bashkin nondissipative drag through simulations of droplet-droplet interactions is shown. The Josephson dynamics of vortex states are studied. Vortices with topological charge $S$ and sufficiently small particle number are typically unstable, breaking up into $S+1$ (occasionally $S+2$) fundamental fragments, with the breakup time increasing as the particle number grows. Unstable asymmetric vortices show splitting and/or crescent-like instability. For vortices with sufficiently large norms, long-time simulations confirm robust stability against small perturbations; in this regime, Josephson oscillations and Andreev-Bashkin-type entrainment for vortex states with charges $S=1, 2$, and $3$ are investigated.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Speckle is the complex interference wave-field produced by a random distribution of un-resolved scatterers. In this paper, we show how these scatterers can be used as virtual microphones to monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of a wave-packet inside the medium. To do so, the concept of matrix imaging is particularly useful. It consists in decoupling the location of the transmitted and received focal spots in a standard beamforming process. By scanning the wave-field with the output focal spot that then acts as a virtual transducer, one can image the spatio-temporal evolution of the wave-packet inside the medium. This unique observable will allow us to highlight the imperfections of the focusing process, in particular the defocus and reverberations induced by a strong aberrating layer. As a proof-of-concept, we will consider ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms. In the next two papers, we will show how this observable can be leveraged to compensate for these phenomena that hamper wave focusing and imaging in all fields of wave physics. Our method is indeed broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a method using speckle for wave-packet imaging, leveraging matrix imaging and virtual microphones for spatio-temporal monitoring in the first of a three-paper series.", "motivation": "The authors aim to demonstrate a novel imaging technique for wave packets using speckle interference, which has applications in various wave physics fields beyond ultrasound.", "method": "Speckle, the interference pattern from random scatterers, is used with matrix imaging to create virtual microphones.

Using linear chains of up to nine \\Ca ions and six \\Sr ions, we demonstrate improved stability as a function of the number of ions that are contributing to the laser frequency stabilization servo. The measured joint fractional frequency stability of the two clocks reaches $1.37(12)\\times 10^{-15}$ at one second, placing an upper bound on the same stability of one of the clocks at $9.6(8)\\times 10^{-16}$ in one second. We measured the frequency ratio of the two clocks to be $R_{\\text{Sr/Ca}}=1.082076536381896986(18)$, where the systematic uncertainty is primarily limited by the room temperature blackbody radiation. Our direct measurement represents an order of magnitude improvement compared to existing indirect frequency ratio measurements.

The tidal interaction is resonantly amplified as the orbital frequency approaches the NS fundamental mode (f-mode) frequency. It has been shown that the exclusion of tidal resonance in parameter estimation leads to a significant bias in the inferred NS tidal deformability and hence the NS EoS [Pratten et al. PRL 129, 081102 (2022)]. The strength and location of tidal resonance depend sensitively on the f-mode frequency, which is typically modeled using its universal relation with the tidal deformability that is derived for an isolated, non-spinning NS assuming only linear fluid perturbations. In a BNS inspiral, the f-mode frequency can be corrected by at least three known effects: nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, and relativity. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the systematic bias on tidal deformability when each frequency correction is ignored. Our study considers both loud, individual events and the stacking of a population of detections. Both scenarios are expected when the next-generation detectors are available with a sensitivity level increased by about an order of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Yi"], "title": "Agnostic Parameter Estimation with Large Spins", "comment": "10 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "The quantum Fisher information of a quantum state with respect to a certain parameter quantifies the sensitivity of the quantum state to changes in that parameter. Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2.

We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\u03c1$ and a known set of observables $\\{O_i\\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\\{\\mathrm{tr}(O_i\u03c1)\\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $\u03b5$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $\u03c1$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $\u03b5$ is below an instance-dependent threshold.\n  Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\\tilde\u0398(\u0393_p/\u03b5^2)$, where $\u0393_p$ is a function of $\\{O_i\\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\\sum_{i=1}^m \u03b1_i O_i$ with $\\|\u03b1\\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $\u0398(\u0393^{\\mathrm{ob}}_p/\u03b5^2)$. We then show $\\tilde\u0398(\u0393_p/\u03b5^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $\u0393^{\\mathrm{ob}}_\\infty = \u0393_\\infty$.

In this work, we demonstrate that performing a Legendre transformation of the black hole on-shell action is equivalent to imposing different boundary conditions on the fields. Consequently, the choice of ensemble must be consistent with, and cannot contradict, the imposed boundary conditions. From this perspective, it follows that for four-dimensional dyonic black holes, the on-shell action can only be expressed either as a function of the electric charge and the magnetic potential, or alternatively as a function of the magnetic charge and the electric potential. Inspired by the Legendre transformation of the Maxwell field, we argue that for purely gravitational theories whose metric geometries admit a \\(U(1)\\) fiber bundle structure, i.e.\\ rotating, boosted, or Kaluza-Klein monopole configurations, one can similarly introduce appropriate Legendre terms, in the sense of dimensional reduction, to modify the thermodynamic ensemble of the black hole.

One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes.

We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components.

This study proposes a novel technique for engineering the field of view of an optical system without compromising the magnification. In the proposed method, an object response pattern is recorded on a camera by introducing a coded phase mask (CPM) in the imaging system. The coded phase mask is a multiplexing of N distinct scattering phases, where N-1 represents the number of isolated object areas to be brought within the field of view. Each scattering phase yields a point spread function of a unique sparse dot pattern on the camera. With the introduction of a coded phase mask, the objects' images are brought within the region of the camera sensor, which, without the CPM, would have remained outside the inherent field of view of the system. To reconstruct the original object plane with N objects at their respective locations, the zero-padded object response pattern is deconvolved with the system's zero-padded and shifted point spread function.

Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries.

Our work demonstrates that quasi-periodically driven dissipative quantum systems can serve as a powerful platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f00\u653eDicke\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u6676(TQCs)\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u6790\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185TQC\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\uff0cTQC\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e5f\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86TQC lifetime\u968f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eTQC lifetime\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4ece\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u589e\u957f\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u6676\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8f83\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u6676\u8fd9\u4e00\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u5f00\u653edicke\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9a\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TQC\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5f00\u653edicke\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u6676\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u6676\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u6676\u7684\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u653edicke\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5177\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u3002"}}

Moffat"], "title": "Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Gravity", "comment": null, "summary": "Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We study this effect for type II string compactifications on general Calabi--Yau manifolds, focusing on vector-multiplet trajectories whose endpoints exhibit axionic shift symmetries. This comprises field excursions of both finite- and infinite distance, but the latter display specific features due to the appearance of light towers of extremal BPS states, in agreement with Swampland principles. We show that vector multiplets split into two sets: those with gravitational and with rigid mutual interactions, and that only a subset of the latter -- dubbed core RFT -- can fully decouple from gravity. We characterise the core RFT in terms of the axionic shift symmetry, and derive decoupling criteria based on kinetic and Pauli interaction mixing. Our framework is illustrated in large complex structure, conifold-like, and Seiberg--Witten limits. In the last case, Pauli mixing obstructs decoupling whenever the dyonic and extremal BPS towers appear at the same scale. Across all these examples, the decoupling from gravity is signalled by a divergent moduli-space scalar curvature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4N=2\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u53bb\u8026\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u521a\u6027\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7c7b\u578bII\u5f26\u5728Calabi-Yau\u6d41\u5f62\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u65f6\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u9650\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f68\u8ff9\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5982\u8f7b\u6781\u5c0fBPS\u6001\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u5f26\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u539f\u5219\u3002\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1a\u5177\u6709\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5177\u6709\u521a\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u540e\u4e00\u7c7b\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u2014\u2014\u6838\u5fc3RFT\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u4ece\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u6838\u5fc3RFT\u901a\u8fc7axionic\u4f4d\u79fb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8ekinetic\u548cPauli\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5206\u79bb\u51c6\u5219\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u590d\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8econifold\u548cSeiberg-Witten\u6781\u9650\u6765\u8bf4\u660e\u3002\u5728\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cPauli\u6df7\u5408\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5f53dyonic\u548c\u6781\u5c0fBPS\u6001\u540c\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cd\u529b\u5206\u79bb\u7531\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u6807\u91cf\u66f2\u7387\u53d1\u6563\u663e\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u53bb\u8026\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u521a\u6027\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7c7b\u578bII\u5f26\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u5728Calabi-Yau\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5176\u5728\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Calabi-Yau\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Swampland\u539f\u5219\u548c\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u5c0fBPS\u6001\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3RFT\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u57fa\u4e8eaxionic\u4f4d\u79fb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u4f53\u6781\u9650\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3RFT\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u7c7b\u578bII\u5f26\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u5728Calabi-Yau\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0b\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3RFT\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u5206\u79bb\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5982Pauli\u6df7\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This is the case, for instance, of those inducing geometrical frustration in a classical magnet. Recently, the study of such settings in quantum systems (dubbed topological frustration) has uncovered peculiar features, interesting both from a fundamental and technological point of view. In this work, we present and discuss the behavior of several quantum resources in presence of TF, namely the (disconnected) entanglement entropy and the non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy. We will show that, compared to their non-frustrated counterparts, TF adds a distinct contribution to these resources, due to a stable, delocalized, topological excitation.

In this work, we present direct imaging of the magnetization dynamics within a single CoFeB-based SHNO using time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). Our measurements reveal that the magnon amplitude is the strongest at the two constriction edges, with a pronounced assymetry favoring one edge, and that emitted spin waves exhibit strongly anisotropic propagation. Micromagnetic simulations suggest that grain boundaries and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) play a key role in both effects.

A localized nanoscale cutoff-wavelength dip, introduced by CO2-laser annealing, provides a reflective boundary, while fiber bending generates a smooth axial potential whose shape is continuously tunable via loop curvature. By adjusting the bending radius, the induced SNAP microresonator evolves from a nearly linear to an approximately semiparabolic axial profile, enabling a controlled transition from dispersive to nearly dispersionless delay. Using a transverse microfiber coupler operated at the impedance-matching condition, we experimentally demonstrate continuous delay tuning from 2 ns to 0.5 ns within a 10 GHz bandwidth in an approximately 2 mm long fiber segment, with insertion loss below 6 dB.

In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations.

During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations.

Real sources, however, can exhibit correlated intensity drift across rounds, potentially leaking intensity information and breaking the standard decoy-state reduction to linear programs. Cauchy--Schwarz (CS) constraints can restore security by coupling $n$-photon yields across intensities, but they introduce nonlinear square-root constraints that are commonly handled via outer linearisation around channel-model-based reference points. We propose a reproducible alternative: first solve the full CS-constrained parameter-estimation problems using the interior-point nonlinear solver IPOPT, then use the resulting candidate solution as the linearisation point for the outer optimisation that certifies a valid lower bound on the asymptotic key rate. Simulations for both coarse-grained model-independent correlations and fine-grained truncated-Gaussian models show consistently tighter key-rate bounds than canonical reference points, and in some cases allow certifying optimality when both optimisation stages coincide.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528hexagonal boron nitride\uff08hBN\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u989c\u8272\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u58f0\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u6e90\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u58f0\u5b50\uff08HPPs\uff09\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5728hBN\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u58f0\u5b50\uff08HPPs\uff09\u548c\u989c\u8272\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u6750\u6599\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u9ad8\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u5728hBN\u8272\u5fc3\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u58f0\u5b50\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u573a\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5076\uff08cavity-QED\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u4e00hBN\u989c\u8272\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f5c\u4e3aHPP\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u53d1\u8f90\u5c04\u5230\u58f0\u5b50\u8fb9\u5e26\u548c\u53d7\u8feb\u62c9\u66fc\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4e2aHPP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\uff0cHPP\u5728\u8d85\u8584\u7247\u5c42\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u8ba1\u6570\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HPP\u7684\u5355\u8272\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3ahBN\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u91cf\u5b50\u8272\u5fc3\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u58f0\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u6e90\u63a7\u5236HPP\uff0c\u800cHPP\u5374\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8272\u5fc3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u8d85\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

To enable a data-driven benchmarking methodology for quantum devices that accounts for both solution quality and the classical computational cost of inference from noisy measurements, we introduce deterministic error mitigation (DEM), a shot-level inference procedure informed by experimentally characterized noise. We demonstrate this approach using the decision version of the $k$-independent set problem. Within a Hamming-shell framework, the DEM candidate volume is governed by the binary entropy of the bit-flip error rate, yielding an entropy-controlled classical postprocessing cost. Using experimental measurement data, DEM reduces postprocessing overhead relative to classical inference baselines. Numerical simulations and experimental results from neutral atom devices validate the predicted scaling with system size and error rate. These scalings indicate that one hour of classical computation on an Intel i9 processor corresponds to neutral atom experiments with up to $N=250-450$ atoms at effective error rates, enabling a direct, cost-based comparison between noisy quantum experiments and classical algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\uff08DEM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u9000agle\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7531\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff08DEM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002DEM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u3001 shots\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u9000agle\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684k-\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728Hamming\u7403\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDEM\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ecf\u5178\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDEM\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u6821\u6b63\u91cf\u5b50\u9000agle\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f53\u7cfb\u6548\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This intriguing result has been interpreted by some authors as arising from essentially replacing the black hole's effective potential and its perturbation with two disjoint potential barriers. We argue that such an analysis may have oversimplified the real physical scenario. To be more precise, a metric perturbation planted farther away from the black hole horizon might not always be appropriately approximated by a disjoint minor barrier. Particularly, for the perturbed P\u00f6schl-Teller potential, joint and disjoint metric perturbations might lead to drastically different stability properties for the low-lying modes. Following this line of thought, this study conducts a refined analysis of the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential by closely examining a few physically relevant ingredients. While our analysis qualitatively confirms the main findings of previous studies, as the stability of the fundamental mode is primarily determined by the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency, we show that specific features of both the effective potential at spatial infinity and the metric perturbation can have a sizable impact on the instability. In contrast, the spiral period, governed by the real part of the quasinormal frequency, appears largely insensitive to the details of the black hole metric or its perturbations. The analytic estimates are in reasonable agreement with the numerical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u5fae\u6270\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u58f0\u5b66\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u8c31scopy\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002 \u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u5fae\u6270\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u6c42\u89e3Quasinormal Modes(QNMs)\u7684\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u52bf\u5792\u65f6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u662f\u6570\u503c\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c06\u5fae\u6270\u7f6e\u4e8e\u8fdc\u5904\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u7528\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u52bf\u5792\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u9636\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u53d8\u3002 \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u662fquasinormal\u9891\u7387\u7684\u865a\u90e8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u5f71\u54cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u8fdc\u5904\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u52bf\u5792\u5206\u79bb\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u5fae\u6270\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002 \u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u58f0\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002 \u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u3002 \u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e3a\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002 \u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002 \u5df2\u7ecf\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002 \u201ctldr\u201d\uff1a\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u5fae\u6270\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002 \u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Thanks to $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM electro-magnetic duality these integrated correlators have recently been computed as exact functions of $N$, $p$, and of the Yang-Mills complexified coupling $\u03c4$. Using a combination of tools from ${\\rm SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ spectral theory and resurgence analysis, we study the landscape of large-$N$ and/or large-charge expansions for these correlators. In particular, we find novel non-perturbative effects in the limit where $N\\rightarrow \\infty$ with $p/N^2$ fixed. From a holographic point of view this double-scaling regime is deeply connected with a second family of correlators which we analyse. Using the results for the maximal-trace operators, we derive an exact expression for a new integrated correlator involving two coherent-state operators, defined via an exponential generating function of multi-graviton states. At large-$N$ this correlator admits a holographic dual description in terms of a back-reacted geometry known as the AdS bubble. First, we show that the leading supergravity contribution to the integrated correlator agrees with a direct explicit integration of the correlator itself. Secondly, we derive predictions for the integrated version of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude evaluated on the AdS bubble background. Lastly, we demonstrate that the large-$N$ non-perturbative contributions to this integrated correlator emerge from giant-magnon configurations in the dual AdS bubble.", "AI": {"tldr":

We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e34\u754c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7387\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u957f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u63a5\u8fd1\u6e17\u53d8\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5448\u4ee3\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6307\u6570\u4e0b\u9650\u4e3a (k+2)\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u8861\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f15\u8d77\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5206\u6790\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u4e34\u754c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7387\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u957f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5176\u4ee3\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u4f53\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6307\u6570\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5178\u578b\u7684MIPT\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f15\u8d77\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u957f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0e\u6e17\u53d8\u76f8\u540c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u8bba\u5206\u5272\u591a\u5c11\uff0cAll party\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4ee3\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\u81f3\u5c11\u662f\u591a\u4f53\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0b\u9650\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u662f (k+2)\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u4f53\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u7ea0\u7f20\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We further explore the intrinsic anomalous thermoelectric and thermal Hall effects in light-irradiated altermagnets. At extremely low temperatures, the thermoelectric Hall coefficient, which exhibits a linear temperature dependence for the thermoelectric Hall conductivity, vanishes within the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. However, it displays peaks and dips at the boundaries of the gap, suggesting that thermoelectric Hall conductivity can be used to probe the bandwidth. Similarly, the low-temperature thermal Hall coefficient, which also shows a linear temperature dependence for the thermal Hall conductivity, becomes quantized in the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. This quantization indicates that thermal Hall conductivity can serve as a probe for the topological properties of the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study reveals that a d-wave alternating magnet can develop Chern insulator properties when subjected to elliptically polarized light, exhibiting intrinsic anomalous thermoelectric and thermal Hall effects.", "motivation": "Understanding the transformation of magnetic materials under light irradiation and the resulting topological properties has significant implications in both fundamental physics and materials science.

However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges associated with propagation loss, limited nonlinearity, and susceptibility to nanoscale fabrication imperfections prevent them from competing with conventional bulk and fiber-based OPAs. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient integrated OPAs with continuous-wave net gain. The pump efficiency is improved by over one order of magnitude. Phase-sensitive gain of 23.5 dB is demonstrated, significantly exceeding previous integrated OPAs, using only 110 mW pump power and no cavity enhancement. This is achieved with parametric down-conversion in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides using the adapted poling technique to maintain the coherence of nonlinear interactions. Moreover, the high parametric gain exceeds fibre-chip-fibre losses, leading to appreciable net gain up to 10 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 120 nm, covering telecommunication S-, C-, and Lbands. Quantum-limited noise performance is confirmed through the measurement of output field fluctuation below the classical limit. We further demonstrate that signalto-noise ratio in noisy optical communications can be increased by leveraging this efficient integrated OPA. Our work marks a significant step towards ideal optical amplifiers with strong amplification, high efficiency, quantum-limited noise, large bandwidth, and continuous-wave operation, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation photonic information processing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u578b\u5149\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff08OPA\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u9650\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u589e\u5f3a\u5149\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u662f\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 Thingsummary \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u578b(OPA)\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5927\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u566a\u58f0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u578b(OPA)\u5728\u5149\u653e\u5927\u5668\u9886\u57df\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5149\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop. Finally, under applied bias, we observe a pronounced redistribution of orbital occupations, demonstrating that the method captures bias-driven orbital charge transfer in realistic materials in nonequilibrium conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u914d\u7f6e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6cd5\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8bba\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e bulk SrVO3 \u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u7406\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u62df\u91d1\u5c5e\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f68\u9053\u6781\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fSrVO3\u7b49\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f68\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6c42\u89e3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86DMFT\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728 bulk SrVO3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u672c\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u8f68\u9053\u6781\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u524d\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6781\u5316\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u8fc1\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 DMFT\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f68\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6781\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u8f68\u9053\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5982\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Utilizing numerical relativity, we achieve stable, long-term evolution of this system and perform a comparative analysis across various parameter spaces. Our comprehensive investigation reveals the formation of a hairy black hole, whose final state is governed by a diverse set of physical parameters.

When a black hole is enclosed by a finite timelike boundary, York's quasi-local first law includes a surface pressure conjugate to the boundary area. Assuming the existence of a holographically dual theory living on this boundary, these geometric quantities correspond to the pressure and volume of the dual thermal system. In this work we focus on static, spherically symmetric black holes, for which these quantities reduce to global thermodynamic variables. The holographic volume provides a notion of system size, allowing extensivity to be defined in standard thermodynamic terms, and it yields a definition of the large-system limit. For the asymptotically flat case, we show that, in the canonical thermodynamic representation, small Schwarzschild black holes are non-extensive, whereas large black holes become extensive in the large-system limit.

This challenge is exacerbated in the distributed quantum computing regime, where quantum networks introduce additional communication-induced noise. While error mitigation techniques such as Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) have proven effective for standalone quantum processors, their behavior in distributed architectures is not yet well understood. We investigate ZNE in this setting by comparing Global optimization (ZNE is applied prior to circuit partitioning), against Local optimization (ZNE is applied independently to each sub-circuit). Partitioning is performed on a monolithic circuit, which is then transformed into a distributed implementation by inserting noisy teleportation-based communication primitives between sub-circuits. We evaluate both approaches across varying numbers of quantum processing units (QPUs) and under heterogeneous local and network noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that Global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving error reductions of up to $48\\%$ across six QPUs. Moreover, we observe counterintuitive noise behavior, where increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead. These findings highlight fundamental trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation and raise new questions regarding the interplay between circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8dc3\u8fc1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8dc3\u8fc1\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u91cf\u5b50\u8dc3\u8fc1\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8dc3\u8fc1\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7a81\u53d8\u70b9\u3001\u51bb\u7ed3\u6001\u548c\u91cf\u5b50Zeno\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \\sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems. We show that this anomalous exponent arises from the hybrid nature of the dynamics: while the lattice evolves deterministically, the electronic degrees of freedom act as an effective internal bath that induces diffusive kink motion without energy dissipation.

However, standard 3DGS relies on spherical harmonics, which often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency view-dependent effects such as sharp reflections and transparency. While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy that maps the viewing direction directly onto the Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of qubits to represent 3D directional data. By replacing classical color-modulating networks with quantum circuits generated via a hypernetwork or conditioning mechanism, we achieve higher expressivity and better generalization.

In this paper, we introduce a class of insulating altermagnets in two dimensions (2D) referred to as Dirac quadrupole altermagnets, and show based on microscopic minimal models that the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of such altermagnets has a topological contribution described by topological response theory. The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole. We consider two microscopic models: a spinless two-band model describing a band inversion of $s$ and $d$ states, and a Lieb lattice model with collinear N\u00e9el order. The latter is a prototypical minimal model for altermagnetism in 2D and is realized in a number of recently proposed material compounds, which are discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4ecb\u7535\u6297\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u65e0\u8f68\u9053\u538b\u78c1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7236\u76f8\u7684\u65e0\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53d7\u5230\u5e94\u53d8\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u54cd\u5e94 psychothe effects.", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7535\u4f4d\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u538b\u78c1\u54cd\u5e94.", "method": "\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728 parents \u7684\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5076\u6781\u8fd8\u539f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u538b\u78c1\u54cd\u5e94\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u8868\u5f81", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u78c1\u94c1\u77f3\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u8f68\u9053\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u538b\u78c1\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u57fa\u7840."}}

In the last decades, security proofs robust against a wide range of eavesdropping strategies have established the theoretical soundness of several QKD protocols. However, most proofs are based on idealized models of the physical systems involved in such protocols and often include assumptions that are not satisfied in practical implementations. This mismatch creates a gap between theoretical security guarantees and actual experimental realizations, making QKD protocols vulnerable to attacks. To ensure the security of real-world QKD systems, it is therefore essential to account for imperfections in security analyses.

It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid.

Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG.

We review these definitions in a common frame and perform a detailed study of the resulting multipole moments for the Kerr event horizon. The horizon multipoles are found to share several properties with the (Hansen) field multipoles, including parity constraints and the leading scaling behavior with respect to the Kerr spin parameter a in the regime of small a. For the axisymmetry-based definition, we have obtained a closed-form expression of the multipole moments in terms of a and the spherical harmonic degree l. For the generic definition, we have established closed-form expressions for the conformal unit round metric, the `electric' and `magnetic' potentials related to the multipoles, and the values of the multipoles in the small a limit. We show that the two definitions lead to different values of the Kerr horizon multipoles as soon as l >= 1 (generic nonzero value of a) or l >= 2 (small a limit).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Analyses of the four- and five-dimensional cases highlight the differences between even- and odd-dimensional configurations, while representative higher-dimensional cases confirm that no additional topological classes or subclasses emerge. We find that only two thermodynamic topological structures appear: the standard class $W^{1+}$ for most configurations, and the distinct subclass $\\tilde{W}^{1+}$ for odd-dimensional black holes with maximal rotations.

Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations.

Our starting point, being the cutting rules for the cosmological correlators, also emphasizes how basic principles, such as unitarity for in-in correlators, can lead us to the dressing rules, which were previously derived in literature following a different method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u8272\u6563\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u5207\u7ebf\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u5e73\u5766\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8d39\u66fc\u56fe\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u540e\u671f\u89c6\u754c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u5668\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5e73\u5766\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d39\u66fc\u56fe\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u8272\u6563\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u5207\u7ebf\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5206\u89e3\u591a\u9876\u70b9\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u9636\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5e73\u5766\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684 dress\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u5668\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u4e86 dress\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Such a ghost in general acquires a pair of complex conjugate masses from radiative corrections whose features are concisely described by the so-called Lee model. Working with the canonical operator formalism of QFTs, we investigate the issue of bound states in the Lee model. We find that the bound states cannot be created from ghosts by contributions of a complex delta function, which is a complex generalization of the well-known Dirac delta function. Since the cause of unitarity violation in the Lee-Wick model is the existence of the complex delta function instead of the Dirac delta function, it is of interest to notice that the violation of the unitarity is also connected to the non-existence of bound states.

However, population transfer with high performance across a broad frequency range is still challenging due to the finite Rabi coupling strength limited by laser powers. Here we propose a novel population-transfer scheme by suturing adiabatic control pulses with each pulse covering certain frequency interval, which are connected in a way that neighboring adiabatic pulses have opposite chirping directions. Taking the widely utilized hyperbolic-square-hyperbolic pulse as an example, we demonstrate that rapid and robust population transfer can be achieved. The transfer bandwidth scales linearly with the number of suture pulses while maintaining high fidelity, even at the suture points where adiabaticity breaks down.

However, existing security proofs are limited to static digital signal processing algorithms, while practical systems rely on dynamic multiple-input multiple-output algorithms to compensate for time-varying channel impairments. Our analysis reveals that the conventional dynamic algorithm, due to its non-unitary nature, systematically underestimates the excess noise, which in turn leads to security issues and the generation of insecure keys. To close this gap, we propose a secure algorithm model, mapping the dynamic algorithm to an equivalent physical optical model whose security can be rigorously assessed. Simulations illustrate the algorithm's non-unitary property and provide a quantitative analysis of the excess noise underestimation caused by the conventional algorithm. We further experimentally validate the necessity of the proposed modeling for dynamic digital signal processing, achieving a secret key rate of 14.4 Mbps based on estimated excess noise of 0.07 shot noise unit; whereas the conventional algorithm would have dangerously overestimated the key rate to 28.2 Mbps with noise of 0.008 shot noise unit.

In this paper we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of alpha sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe. The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and does not carry any quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates classical ensemble data with the quantum mechanics experienced by bulk observers and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of \"It from Bit\". We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size.

The corresponding critical point coincides with a phase transition into two-component ``grey galaxy'' configurations in the micro-canonical ensemble.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW)\u51c6\u5219\u5728\u590d\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53N=4\u8d85\u5171\u5f62\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027Yang-Mills\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u65cb\u8f6c\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9ed1\u5b50\u978d\u70b9KSW\u51c6\u5219\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8d85\u80fd\u91cf\u6307\u6570\u5d29\u6e83\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5fae\u89c2\u4fdd\u5b88\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u663e\u73b0\u4e3a\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206'\u7070\u8272 galaxies'\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65cb\u8f6c\u52a8\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7KSW\u51c6\u5219\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u590d\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86N=4\u8d85\u5171\u5f62\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027Yang-Mills\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u65cb\u8f6c\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0d\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0KSW\u51c6\u5219\u5728\u8d85\u65cb\u8f6c\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e0e\u8d85\u80fd\u91cf\u6307\u6570\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\u5d29\u6e83\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5fae\u89c2\u4fdd\u5b88\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u663e\u73b0\u4e3a\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206'\u7070\u8272 galaxies'", "conclusion": "\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u7684KSW\u51c6\u5219\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u52a8\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "We introduce a tensor-network technique for classical optimization using concepts from quantum mechanics.", "motivation": "The paper presents an original approach to optimization problems by inspired quantum concepts to offer novel solutions.", "method": "The method involves using a scaled Ising Hamiltonian, applying power iteration, representing it as an MPO, and sampling.", "result": "The proposed approach successfully solves the optimization problem outperforms simulated annealing, especially in avoiding local minima.", "conclusion": "This work opens new avenues by translating quantum principles into classical optimization methods, with promising future applications."}}

We derive a black brane solution for this model, accurate to the first order in the coupling parameter. Using gauge/gravity duality techniques, we then compute two key holographic transport coefficients: the color non-abelian direct current (DC) conductivity and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. Our analysis reveals that both transport coefficients are modified by the non-minimal coupling, with the conductivity bound violated for positive $q_2$ and the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound for shear viscosity violated for negative $q_2$.

We construct the exact scattering solutions, obtain closed expressions for the partial-wave $S$ matrix and phase shifts, and derive the corresponding scattering amplitude, differential cross section, and total cross section. We also show that the pole structure of the $S$ matrix is consistent with the bound-state quantization previously obtained for the helically twisted Coulomb-like problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u87ba\u65cb\u5f62\u626d\u66f2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u5e93\u4ed1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u963f\u8d1d\u62c9- bohm(AB) \u78c1\u901a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f15\u5165AB\u52bf\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u53ef\u88ab\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e93\u4ed1\u52a0AB\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u7684\u76f8\u540cKummer\u578b\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u8d77\u5e93\u4ed1\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u78c1\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u6709m\u2192m-\u03bb\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u89e3\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u6570\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u5dee\u5206\u622a\u9762\u548c\u603b\u622a\u9762\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86S\u77e9\u9635\u6781\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5f26\u72b6\u5e93\u4ed1\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u6709\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3AB\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u87ba\u65cb\u5f62\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u548cAB\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u5f84\u5411\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5df2\u77e5\u7684Kummer\u578b\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u6570\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u5173\u5dee\u5206\u622a\u9762\u548c\u603b\u622a\u9762\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AB\u52bf\u4e0b\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u5e26\u6709\u87ba\u65cb\u5f62\u626d\u66f2\u548cAB\u52bf\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e93\u4ed1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u6027\u8d28\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6563\u5c04\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Given any decoupling group $\\mathcal G$ that averages the interaction to zero, our construction yields pulse sequences whose length scales as $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal G| K)$, while canceling all error terms linear in the system-bath coupling strength up to order $K$ in the total evolution time. As a corollary, for an $n$-qubit system with $k$-local system-bath interactions, we obtain an $\\mathcal{O}(n^{k-1}K)$-pulse sequence, a significant improvement over existing schemes with $\\mathcal{O}(\\exp(n))$ pulses (for $k=\\mathcal{O}(1)$). The construction is obtained via a mapping to the continuous necklace-splitting problem, which asks how to cut a multi-colored interval into pieces that give each party the same share of every color.

Implementing such unitaries on fault-tolerant devices requires first compiling them into a discrete universal gate set, typically Clifford$+T$. Here, we propose a different approach for their synthesis: compile matchgate unitaries using only matchgate gates. To this end, we first show that the matchgate-Clifford group (the intersection of the matchgate and Clifford groups) plus the $\\overline{T}$ gate (a $T$ unitary up to a phase) is universal for the matchgate group. Our approach leverages the connection between $n$-qubit matchgate circuits and the standard representation of $\\mathbb{SO}(2n)$, which reduces the compilation from $2^n\\times 2^n$ unitaries to $2n\\times2n$ ones, thus reducing exponentially the size of the target matrix. Moreover, we rigorously show that this scheme is efficient, as an approximation error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{SO}(2n)}$ incurred in this smaller-dimensional representation translates at most into an $O(n \\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{SO}(2n)})$ error in the exponentially large unitary. In addition, we study the exact version of the matchgate synthesis problem, and we prove that all matchgate unitaries $U$ such that $U\\otimes U^*$ has entries in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}\\big[1/\\sqrt 2,i\\big]$ can be exactly synthesized by a finite sequence of gates from the matchgate-Clifford$+\\overline{T}$ set, without ancillas.

In this paper, we focus on the single-shot discrimination of two noisy quantum channels using two distinct classes of probes: single-system (product) probes and entangled probes. Our aim is to identify optimal probing state for specific discrimination tasks and to analyze the necessity and role of entanglement in enhancing channel distinguishability. We show that maximally entangled probes are optimal for discriminating two qubit depolarizing channels, with any nonzero entanglement providing an advantage over single-system probes. In contrast, for dephasing channels in arbitrary dimensions, we prove that single-system probe can be optimal and that entanglement offers no improvement, even when the dephasing unitary is generalized. For qubit amplitude-damping channels, we identify distinct noise-dependent regimes in which either single-system probe outperforms maximally entangled probes and vice-versa. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-maximally entangled probes can act as the optimum probe if the noise parameters restricted to certain values in this task. We also present examples of noisy unitary channels for which discrimination is possible using non-maximally entangled probe, while both single-systems and maximally entangled probes fail. We introduce another class of noisy unitary channels for which perfect discrimination is achievable with a single system, while maximally entangled probes are insufficient.

In this work, we for the first time systematically discuss multiple implementations of AIM and establish a unified mathematical formulation. On this basis, by treating the binarization constraint of AIM (such as injection locking) as a Lagrange multiplier in optimization theory and combining it with a Lyapunov analysis from dynamical systems theory, an analytical framework for evaluating solution speed and accuracy is constructed, and further demonstrate that conventional AIMs possess a theoretical performance upper bound. Subsequently, by elevating the binarization constraint to a control variable, we propose the controllable analog Ising machine (CAIM), which integrates control Lyapunov functions and momentum-based optimization algorithms to realize adaptive sampling-feedback control, thereby surpassing the performance limits of conventional AIMs. In a proof-of-concept CAIM demonstration implemented using an FPGA-controlled LC-oscillator Ising machine, CAIM achieves a twofold speedup and a 7\\% improvement in accuracy over AIM on a 50-node all-to-all weighted MaxCut problem, validating both the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed theoretical framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this thesis, I present my work using nuclear spins to explore these themes.\n  First, I study temporal quantum correlations quantified by the Leggett Garg inequality (LGI) for a qubit evolving under a superposition of unitary operators. Using a three qubit quantum register, we experimentally realized superposed unitaries and observed LGI violations exceeding the maximal quantum bound of 1.5, indicating enhanced non-classicality. Notably, this superposed unitary dynamics also showed improved robustness against decoherence.\n  Next, I investigate Lee Yang zeros, which are zeros of the partition function in the complex plane that reveal thermodynamic behavior near criticality. We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method to determine the full set of Lee Yang zeros of an asymmetric Ising model using a single quantum probe in a three-qubit nuclear spin register. We further showed that the mutual information between the probe and system peaks at times corresponding to these zeros.\n  I then report our study of the quantum Mpemba effect in nuclear spin relaxation, where systems farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to steady state, verified both theoretically and experimentally using NMR. Finally, I discuss our work on entanglement localization and delocalization induced by local interactions, leading to an apparent violation of the quantum data processing inequality.

As a first approach, we apply linear splitting methods to the restricted, continuous equations of motion derived from variational principles. We utilize an exchange interaction Hamiltonian to confirm that the numerical and analytical solutions coincide in the limit of small time steps. The application to different Hamiltonians shows the wide applicability of the method to detect dynamical entanglement. To avoid the derivation of analytical solutions for complex dynamics, we consider variational, numerical integration schemes, introducing a variational discretization for Lagrangians linear in velocities. Here, we examine and compare two approaches: one in which the system is discretized before the restriction is applied, and another in which the restriction precedes the discretization. We find that the \"first-discretize-then-restrict\" method becomes numerically unstable, already for the example of an exchange-interaction Hamiltonian, which can be an important consideration for the numerical analysis of constrained quantum dynamics.

Over the years, it has enabled the implementation of arbitrary completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) maps; an important next step is to extend control to Hermitian-preserving and trace-preserving (HPTP) maps, which underpin applications such as entanglement detection, quantum error mitigation, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning. Here we present an efficient and fully constructive method for implementing arbitrary HPTP maps. Unlike existing methods that decompose an HPTP map into multiple CPTP maps or approximate it using bipartite Hamiltonians with large Hilbert spaces, our approach compiles a target HPTP map into a single executable CPTP map whose Kraus rank is guaranteed to be no larger than the intrinsic rank of the target HPTP map plus one, followed by simple classical post-processing. Numerical results for inverse noise channels used in quantum error mitigation, including bosonic photon loss, confirm substantial reductions in resources and highlight scalability in higher-dimensional settings. Together with our numerical benchmarks, these results validate the efficiency and versatility of the proposed framework, opening a route to broader quantum-information applications enabled by HPTP processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $\u03b1$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \\sqrt{\\frac{n^3}{2^{\\max\\{\\lfloor (\u03b1-1)/2 \\rfloor},0\\}}}\\cdot\\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $\u03a9( \\frac{n^2}{2^\u03b1} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $\u03a9( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the choice of base material also influences the sensitivity to quasiparticle-induced decoherence. In this study, we investigate quasiparticle tunneling rates in niobium and tantalum-based offset-charge-sensitive qubits. Using a source of thermal radiation, we characterize the sensitivity of either material to infrared radiation and explore the impact of the infrared background through the targeted use of in-line filters in the wiring and ambient infrared absorbers. We identify both radiation channels as significant contributions to decoherence for tantalum but not for niobium qubits and achieve tunneling rates of 100 Hz and 300 Hz for niobium and tantalum respectively upon installation of infrared filters. Additionally, we find a time-dependence in the observed tunneling rates on the scale of days, which we interpret as evidence of slowly cooling, thermally radiating components in the experimental setup.

They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions.

Given access to an unknown channel, a central problem is whether these transformations can be implemented physically with quantum supermaps. While such supermaps are known for unitary operations, the situation for general quantum channels is fundamentally different. In this work, we establish a strict hierarchy of physical realizability for the transposition, complex conjugation, and adjoint transformation of an unknown quantum channel. We present a probabilistic protocol that exactly implements the transpose with a single query. In contrast, we prove no-go theorems showing that neither the complex conjugate nor the adjoint can be implemented by any completely positive supermap, even probabilistically. We then overcome this impossibility by designing a virtual protocol for the complex conjugate based on quasi-probability decomposition, and show its optimality in terms of the diamond norm.

Standard quantum error mitigation is typically based on post-processing strategies. In contrast, the present work explores a pre-processing approach, in which the effects of noise are mitigated before performing a measurement on the output state. The main idea is to find an observable $Y$ such that its expectation value on a noisy quantum state $\\mathcal{E(\u03c1)}$ matches the expectation value of a target observable $X$ on the noiseless quantum state $\u03c1$. Our method requires the execution of a noisy quantum circuit, followed by the measurement of the surrogate observable $Y$. The main enablers of our method in practical scenarios are Tensor Networks. The proposed method improves over Tensor Error Mitigation (TEM) in terms of average error, circuit depth, and complexity, attaining a measurement overhead that approaches the theoretical lower bound. The improvement in terms of classical computation complexity is in the order of $\\sim 10^6$ times when compared to the post-processing computational cost of TEM in practical scenarios. Such gain comes from eliminating the need to perform the set of informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (IC-POVM) required by TEM, as well as any other tomographic strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u964d\u4f4e\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u9700\u8981IC-POVM\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u5168\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u6291\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, the application of quantum algorithms to integer optimization problems remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to integer problems on graphs, with each integer variable encoded in a qudit. We derive a general iterative formula for depth-$p$ QAOA expectation on high-girth $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary size. The cost of evaluating the formula is exponential in the QAOA depth $p$ but does not depend on the graph size. Evaluating this formula for Max-$k$-Cut problem for $p\\leq 4$, we identify parameter regimes ($k=3$ with degree $d \\leq 10$ and $k=4$ with $d \\leq 40$) in which QAOA outperforms the Frieze-Jerrum semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm, which provides the best worst-case guarantee on the approximation ratio. To strengthen the classical baseline we introduce a new heuristic algorithm, based on the degree-of-saturation, that empirically outperforms both the Frieze-Jerrum algorithm and shallow-depth QAOA. Nevertheless, we provide numerical evidence that QAOA may overtake this heuristic at depth $p\\leq 20$. Our results show that moving beyond binary to integer optimization problems can open up new avenues for quantum advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines QAOA's application to integer optimization problems on graphs using qudits, presenting a new formula for its expectation and demonstrating QAOA's potential quantum advantage over classical methods for certain problem instances.", "motivation": "Exploring quantum algorithms for integer optimization problems to identify potential quantum advantages.", "method": "Derives a general QAOA formula for high-girth regular graphs, evaluates QAOA for Max-k-Cut, and compares with classical SDP algorithms and a new heuristic.", "result": "QAOA outperforms Frieze-Jerrum for certain k and d.
