A key step towards\nits independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with\nimproved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments\nrely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors,\nwhich present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic\nradioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D\nproject developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is\nread out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon\ndetection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark\nnoise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at\ncryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed\ncryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the\ndetector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first\nexperimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large\narea (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a\npreliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising,\nalso in light of several planned developments.

Naturally occurring fluoride and industrial runoff can\nresult in concentrations far exceeding the World Health Organization's\nrecommended limits in water supplies. In this study, we derive a model\nincorporating the dominant mechanisms governing fluoride removal from drinking\nwater using the two adsorbents mineral-rich carbon (MRC) and chemically treated\nmineral-rich carbon (TMRC). Using both new and previously published\nexperimental data, we validate the model for MRC, TMRC, and their mixture,\nusing both batch and column data. Despite the filters containing approximately\n40:1 MRC:TMRC ratio by mass, we find that TMRC dominates fluoride removal,\nwhile MRC contributes at early and late times. The full column model, which\nuses parameters from isotherm batch studies, achieves excellent agreement with\nexperimental breakthrough data across varying inlet concentrations and flow\nrates (R$^2>0.991$, SSE$<0.0632$). Motivated by this, we propose a reduced\nmodel based solely on TMRC adsorption, with a single fitting parameter, which\nstill performs well across all breakthrough curves (R$^2 > 0.983$, SSE\n$<0.117$). The simplicity of this model means that it is straightforward and\ninexpensive to work with numerically. In both models, batch and column\nbehaviours are reconciled and, for the case of breakthrough curves with varying\ninlet concentrations, a set of globally optimised parameters is found. The\nstrong agreement with experimental data supports the model's robustness and\nreinforces the physical interpretability of its parameters.

A novel type of\nrubrene microcrystal is prepared in the orthorhombic phase, exhibiting\nzone-sectored tabular domains with distinct photoluminescence (PL)\ncharacteristics. These sectors exhibit distinct PL spectra and time-evolution,\narising from differences in the in-plane orientation of the orthorhombic unit\ncell relative to the crystal surface. A combination of polarised optical\nmicroscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) is used to characterise the samples in terms of crystal\norientation, fluorescence lifetime, and photoluminescence spectra. Spatially\nresolved PL spectroscopy reveals that the redshifted 650 nm emission band has\npolarisation along the transition dipole moment and is associated with high\nphoton absorption due to the alignment of excitation polarisation and\ntransition dipole moment and selectively localized within specific sectors of\nthe crystal. The detected photon originates from direct emission of a geminate\ncoherent triplet pair, or from its fusion. This band exhibits pure\nmono-exponential dynamics with 3.7 ns lifetime. The triplet fusion behaviour in\nthe succeeding time regimes can be treated in the framework of power law\nscaling and random walk. The emission kinetics are modelled using rate\nequations describing geminate and non-geminate exciton fusion processes,\nenabling a quantitative interpretation of the spatially resolved PL kinetics.\nThese findings introduce a material-based strategy, opening novel routes for\nphotonic applications and light harvesting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u5b9a\u5f62\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7ea2\u79fb650nm\u53d1\u5149\u5e26\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5149\u6b63\u4ea4\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3001\u8367\u5149\u5bff\u547d\u6210\u50cf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u8868\u5f81\u5176\u53d1\u5149\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6001\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u673a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u65e0\u5b9a\u5f62\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u5149\u7535\u6027\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5149\u7535\u50ac\u5316\u548c\u5149\u80fd\u6536\u96c6\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u53d1\u5149\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7279\u6027\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5149\u6b63\u4ea4\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3001\u8367\u5149\u5bff\u547d\u6210\u50cf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa650nm\u53d1\u5149\u5e26\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53d1\u5c04\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u57fa\u5e95\u6750\u6599\u5728\u5149\u7535\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u6676\u4f53\u65e0\u5b9a\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u53d1\u5149\u7279\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u7535\u5668\u4ef6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u754c\u9762\u4e0a\u6001\u6001\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0e\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Here, we establish the thermodynamic limits for dissociative\nnitrogen reduction using elemental metals by decomposing the process into three\nsteps: metal deposition, nitridation, and protonation.

In this paper, we study a subset of\nthese defects related to the GSO projection on the string worldsheet. These\ninclude the predicted domain wall between Type IIA and IIB superstring theories\nand the newly-discovered $\\mathrm{R}7$-brane. We study these defects in two\ndifferent ways: via long-string probes and target-space effective field theory.\nWe find that the $\\mathrm{R}7$-brane can be identified with a collapsed\ncylindrical configuration of the IIA/IIB wall, and further, that the\n$\\mathrm{R}7$-brane is stable, in contrast to previous expectations. Moreover,\nwe argue that BPS D-branes pulled across the IIA/IIB wall become non-BPS\nD-branes, which we identify with fluxbrane configurations. We show that the\nnon-BPS D-branes of either Type II theory are charged under a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nremnant of the Ramond-Ramond potentials of the other, which we identify with\nthe mod 2 reduction of the Ramond-Ramond fluxes.

The resulting binding energies range from $-33.8$~keV to\n$-340$~eV. Notably, we present the first theoretical estimation of the\nbound-state energy levels of $pp\\mu^-\\mu^-$ and $pp\\tau^-\\tau^-$, which is of\nsignificant importance for understanding exotic few-body Coulomb systems. We\nfurther analyze spin configurations and root-mean-square radii to elucidate the\nspatial structure of these bound and quasi-bound states. Our results reveal\nthat $K$-type spatial configurations play a crucial role in accurately\ndescribing bound and quasi-bound states in the hydrogen-molecule-like systems\n$pp\\mu^-\\mu^-$ and $pp\\tau^-\\tau^-$.

Traditional crosslinkers such as\ndivinylbenzene (DVB) often requires high-temperature radical initiators and are\nlimited by poor compatibility with saturated hydrocarbon matrices. In contrast,\nbis-diazirine (BD) crosslinkers offer a promising alternative by harnessing\nthermally or photochemically generated carbene intermediates for highly\nselective C-H bond insertions. Here, we employ density functional theory\n(DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular\nmechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS. We\ndemonstrate that BD enables efficient covalent linkage through low free energy\nbarriers , facilitating crosslinking at moderate temperatures without catalysts\nand with minimal sensitivity to polymer chain length.

In this work, we consider a specific, unitary model of the interaction\nbetween the Friend and the system in the presence of a decohering environment.\nIn particular, we study WF scenarios from the perspective of quantum Darwinism\n(QD). The QD framework is well-suited to studying the questions of observations\nand agents in quantum theory that WF scenarios raise, as it is concerned with\nhow observers record objective information about a system with access only to\nits surroundings. Here we describe how to add environments to simple and\nextended WF scenarios in the QD framework, and present numerical results that\nstudy the emergence of classicality, in the form of the Friend's measurement\nresult becoming more objective. In both the simple and extended cases, we also\nfind that the model and the environment obfuscate genuine WF effects and\nintroduce strong restrictions on them. However, we also find a novel form of WF\neffect that exploits coherence between the Friend and the environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a unitary model of the Wigner's Friend thought experiment involving a decohering environment within quantum Darwinism, showing how classical information emerges for the Friend while masking genuine quantum effects except when coherence between the Friend and environment is utilized.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the Wigner's Friend scenario, a foundational topic in quantum mechanics, and aims to reconcile quantum effects with classical observations, which is crucial for understanding observer perspectives in quantum theory.", "method": "The authors employ quantum Darwinism, a framework focusing on how observers record objective information by examining their surroundings. They incorporate decohering environments into the model of the Friend to simulate real-world decoherence, using numerical methods to analyze the emergence of classicality and the suppression of quantum weirdness, except when environmental coherence is harnessed.", "result": "Numerical results demonstrate that decoherence in specific forms hinders genuine quantum phenomena in the Wigner's Friend setup, but a new effect emerges where coherence between the Friend and environment allows for the observation of quantum effects, revealing a novel form of the effect.", "conclusion": "The study contributes novel insights into how decoherence affects the Wigner's Friend scenario within quantum Darwinism. It highlights the delicate balance between quantum phenomena and classicality, suggesting that new quantum phenomena may only emerge when environmental coherence is synchronize d with the Friend's states. The work enhances our understanding of observer-state dependence in quantum mechanics and offers new angles for exploring quantum weirdness."}}

By applying the Israel junction\nconditions explicitly in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to\nthe gravitational sector, it is shown that a nontrivial scalar profile cannot\nbe sustained, as it induces a divergence at the stellar center. Since\nanalytical solutions are unattainable, the background metric is determined\nthrough numerical integration for a few representative configurations. For\naxial gravitational perturbations, it is found that the system of equations of\nmotion cannot be decoupled as long as the {\\AE}ther parameter $c_i$ does not\nvanish. Subsequently, the dynamics of the system can be simplified to two\ncoupled equations that describe vector and tensor perturbations with distinct\nwave velocities $c_V$ and $c_T$, giving rise to a bimodal system. It is shown\nthat as the stellar radius is smaller than that of the maximum of the vacuum\nSchwarzschild-type effective potential, a potential well is formed, leading to\nthe emergence of echo phenomenon for the axial gravitational perturbations.\nWhen the stellar radius exceeds the {\\it could-have-been} maximum, the\nresulting effective potential decreases monotonically, and the wave propagation\nis primarily dictated by the discontinuity occurring at the star's surface,\nproducing a type of more attenuated echo waves. In addition, we explore the\nspecific properties of the resultant bimodal medium consisting of two degrees\nof freedom with distinct sound speeds. However, it is understood that such a\ncharacteristic does not lead to observational implications, and subsequently\nhardly offers a potential empirical means to constrain specific metric\nparameters of the Einstein-{\\AE}ther.

The network feedforward involves qubit rotations\nwhose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The\nnetwork is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on\nquantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an\ninterpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing\n$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to\nimprove network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.\nWe then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical\nneural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such\nborderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We\nattribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between\nnearby minima of the classification energy landscape.

Palma", "Spyros Sypsas", "Danilo Tapia"], "title": "Confronting infrared divergences in de Sitter: loops, logarithms and the stochastic formalism", "comment": "30 pp + refs, 2 figures", "summary": "A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de\nSitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de\nSitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in\ncorrelation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is\nwidely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar\nfields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is\nthought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic\nformalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these\ninfrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial\ndistinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected\nby a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former,\nthe shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in\nwhich secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although\ncorrelation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they\nremain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the\nstructure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in\nthe soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level\ncorrelators.

The benchmarks identify the regimes where the aTTNs offer\nadvantages in accuracy relative to computational cost compared to matrix\nproduct states and tree tensor networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7684++. \u7cbe\u9ad3\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u6811\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08aTTN\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5206\u79bb\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ef4\u6570\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u6676\u683c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u7ea0\u7f20\u968f\u7740\u6676\u683c\u5927\u5c0f\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u6811\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08aTTN\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u9694\u5355\u5143\uff08unitary disentanglers\uff09\u6765\u5438\u6536\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\uff0caTTN\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "aTTN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of\noptimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport\nand quantum mobilities reaching close to 10$^8$ and 10$^6$ cm$^2$/Vs,\nrespectively. Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving,\nit remains comparatively lower. Here we report a transformative improvement in\nthe electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its\nimmediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge\ninhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10$^7$\ncm$^-2$ and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum\nmobilities reach 10$^7$ cm$^2$/Vs, surpassing those in the highest-quality\nsemiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport\nmobilities match their record. This quality enables Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaus below 5 mT.\nAlthough proximity screening predictably suppresses electron-electron\ninteractions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their\nenergy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3-5 compared to unscreened devices,\ndemonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm\nremain robust.

The ever-growing\ndemand for these applications has driven efforts in enhancing modulation\ncoupling strength and bandwidth towards advanced pulse-comb synthesis. However,\nthe effects of strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity EO modulation remain\nunderexplored, due to the lack of a general, unified model that captures this\nextreme condition. In this work, we present a universal framework for\npulse-comb synthesis under cavity EO modulation, where coupling strength and\nmodulation bandwidth far exceed the cavity's free spectral range (FSR). We show\nthat, under such intense and ultrafast driving conditions, EO-driven frequency\ncombs and pulses exhibit rich higher-order nonlinear dynamics, including\ntemporal pulse compression and comb generation with arbitrary pump detuning.\nLeveraging this framework, we reveal a direct link between the higher-order\ndynamics of EO pulse-comb generation and the band structure of synthetic\ndimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate arbitrary comb shaping via\nmachine-learning-based inverse microwave drive design, achieving a tenfold\nenhancement in cavity electro-optic comb flatness by exploring the synergistic\neffects of high-bandwidth driving and detuning-induced frequency boundaries.\nOur findings push cavity electro-optic modulation into a new frontier,\nunlocking significant potential for universal and machine-learning-programmable\nelectro-optic frequency combs, topological photonics, as well as photonic\nquantum computing in the strong-coupling and high-bandwidth regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2 DONE \u7ec4\u5408\u5149\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u53cd\u5411\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u5bbd\u8c10\u6ce2 DONE \u7ec4\u5408\u5149\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u548c\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u548c\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u5bbd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684 EO \u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u6ce2\u53cd\u5411\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u5149\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5149\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5341\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8d85\u5bbd\u8c10\u6ce2 DONE \u7ec4\u5408\u5149\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

This comparison evaluates both the time taken by each AI\nLLM platform to generate quantum operations (including networking times), as\nwell as the execution time of these operations in Python, within Jupyter\nNotebook. Our results show that overall, Gemini is the fastest AI LLM in\nproducing quantum gate designs. At the same time, the AI LLMs tested achieved\nworking quantum operations 80% of the time. These findings highlight a\npromising horizon where publicly available Large Language Models can become\nfast collaborators with quantum computers, enabling rapid quantum gate\nsynthesis and paving the way for greater interoperability between two\nremarkable and cutting-edge technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study benchmarks four AI LLMs for generating quantum operations, showing Gemini is the fastest, with successful gate designs achieved 80% of the time.", "motivation": "Understanding the performance and interoperability of AI LLMs in quantum computing is crucial for advancing quantum gate synthesis and collaboration with quantum hardware.", "method": "The research used Wolfram Mathematica to interface with four AI models, comparing their time to generate quantum gates and execution in Python within Jupyter Notebook.

Distributed coupled-cavity laser (DCCL) systems, as a\nrepresentative configuration, have been proposed to expand the field of view\n(FoV) and enhance safety. This paper investigates the safety assessment of\nDCCL-WPT systems through three case studies: skin safety, eye safety, and\nsmall-object intrusion sensitivity. First, we establish a safety analysis model\nto quantify irradiation levels on intruding objects in the beam path, which\nsimulates intracavity beam propagation using diffraction modeling and gain-loss\ndynamics under case-specific boundary conditions. Next, we formulate an eye\nsafety evaluation tailored for DCCL-WPT systems using a human head model to\nidentify potential exposure angles and distances. Ray tracing confirms that\nintracavity beams are not focused onto the retina, making cornea exposure the\nprimary consideration (irradiance is below 0.1 W/cm2). Numerical results\ndemonstrate that DCCL-WPT achieves: i) over 600 mW charging power under\nskin-safe conditions at 5 m distance (100 mW over 16{\\deg} FoV), and nearly 50%\nlower irradiance on intruding objects compared to single-cavity systems; ii)\n150 mW charging power under eye-safe conditions with 650 mW 1064 nm output beam\npower, far beyond the typical ~10 mW eye-safe threshold; iii) high sensitivity\nto small-object intrusion, enabling hazard mitigation.

In\ncontrast, mode-locked lasers can produce broad-band, ultrafast (< 1 ps) pulses,\nbut are complex, expensive, and typically require a large footprint. To bridge\nthe parameter gap between these two laser platforms - in terms of pulse\nduration and achievable peak power - we here propose a Herriott-type multi-pass\ncell (MPC) based post-compression scheme for shortening the pulse durations of\nQ-switched lasers down to the ultrafast, picosecond regime. We experimentally\ndemonstrate post-compression of 0.5 ns, 1 mJ pulses from a Q-switched laser to\n24 ps using a compact glass-rod MPC for spectral broadening.

First, we analyze the\nneutral Simpson-Visser geometry, recovering Schwarzschild at $\\ell=0$, and then\nits charged extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om metric. In both these cases,\nwe derive the conservation equations and analyze two representative fluid\nmodels: a barotropic perfect fluid and a constituent with an exponential\ndensity profile. By varying the parameters across regimes, we locate critical\n(sonic) points and integrate velocity, density and pressure profiles. While\nnear-horizon inflow velocities are similar across the different solutions, we\nfind that the critical radius and the resulting accretion rates and\nluminosities severely change, depending on the value of the parameter and type\nof fluid. Remarkably, the barotropic and exponential cases exhibit different\ntrends in the outer regions. Moreover, by extending the analysis to the charged\nSV spacetime, we find that the presence of a central charge $Q$ produces\nadditional, albeit modest, shifts in the sonic radius which, in combination\nwith those induced by the regularization parameter $\\ell$, could provide a\ndouble observational marker. In particular, while $\\ell$ acts predominantly on\nthe position of the critical point, in the barotropic fluid case, the\nelectromagnetic contribution of $Q$ slightly dampens the inflow velocity near\nthe horizon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Simpson-Visser\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bbaBondi\u5438ptron\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u548c\u5176\u5e26\u7535\u6269\u5c55\u7684Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e86\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u548c\u6d41\u901f\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ca\u538b\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u53ca\u4eae\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e26\u7535Simpson-Visser\u65f6\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7535\u8377Q\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u2113\u5bf9\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cc\u91cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u6807\u5fd7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u6d41\u4f53\u4e3a\u6307\u6570\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u8fdc\u5904\u76f8\u6bd4\u7edd\u70ed\u578b\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0b\u7684\u5438ptron\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5438ptron\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4e3a\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u6807\u5c3a\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5728\u4e2d\u6027Simpson-Visser\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63a5\u7740\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u7535\u7684Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u538b\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u2113\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u901f\u7387\u548c\u4eae\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u7535\u65f6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7535\u8377Q\u5bf9\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u2113\u5bf9\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982Simpson-Visser\u548cReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\u65f6\u7a7a\uff0c\u5438\u79ef\u901f\u7387\u3001\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u4eae\u5ea6\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u2113\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u2113\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5438\u79ef\u534a\u5f84\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cc\u91cd\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5438etrac\u7269\u7535\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53cc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u540c\u6837\uff0c\u6307\u6570\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7edd\u70ed\u6d41\u4f53\u5728\u8fdc\u5904\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Simpson-Visser\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u5438ptron\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u503c\u53ca\u6d41\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5438ptron\u7684\u58f0\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5438\u79ef\u901f\u7387\u548c\u4eae\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u91cd\u786e\u8ba4\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u2113\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7535\u8377Q\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6807\u5c3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

For hardware capable of\nlong-range connectivity, the bivariate bicycle codes offer significant overhead\nreduction compared to surface codes with similar performance. In this work, we\npresent \"ZSZ codes\", a simple non-abelian generalization of the bivariate\nbicycle codes based on the group $\\mathbb{Z}_\\ell \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_m$. We\nnumerically demonstrate that certain instances of this code family achieve\ncompetitive performance with the bivariate bicycle codes under circuit-level\ndepolarizing noise using a belief-propagation and ordered-statistics decoder,\nwith an observed threshold around $0.5\\%$. We also benchmark the performance of\nthis code family under local \"self-correcting\" decoders, where we observe\nsignificant improvements over the bivariate bicycle codes, including evidence\nof a sustainable threshold around $0.095\\%$, which is higher than the $0.06\\%$\nthat we estimate for the four-dimensional toric code under the same noise\nmodel. These results suggest that ZSZ codes are promising candidates for\nscalable self-correcting quantum memories.

If the procedure for\nbuilding a consistent reference frame within the framework of the general\ntheory of relativity is well established (cf. resolutions B.3 of IAU 2000),\nthere is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be\nadopted as reference in the cislunar region.

In the classical case, the black hole entropy obeys the\nBekenstein-Hawking area law and satisfies the standard universality relation.\nWe then incorporate quantum corrections using three distinct frameworks: the\nGeneralized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the Extended Uncertainty Principle\n(EUP), and Rainbow Gravity. While these corrections modify the entropy law, we\nfind that a generalized form of the universal extremality relation still holds.\nNext, we explore the thermodynamic topology of VdW black holes, focusing on the\ndistribution of topological charges. Our analysis reveals that variations in\nthe black hole and model parameters lead to significant changes in topological\nclassifications and stability, as quantified by winding numbers. In the\nGUP-corrected case, topological charge distributions exhibit robustness against\nparameter variations, suggesting classification stability. For EUP-corrected\nblack holes, we identify two distinct topological classes, with some\nconfigurations displaying three non-zero topological charges and others\nmaintaining a total charge of zero, despite changes in individual charge\ncounts.

Using a\nHamiltonian dynamical systems approach, we examine the behavior near critical\npoints and identify the sonic transitions in each scenario. Our results show\nthat the LV parameter influences the location of critical points, the flow\nstructure, and the accretion rate, with $l>0$ ($l<0$) enhancing (suppressing)\nthe latter. For ultra-stiff fluids, no critical points are found, and the flow\nremains entirely subsonic. For ultra-relativistic and radiation fluids,\ntransonic solutions exist, with the position of the sonic point depending on\nthe sign of $l$. We also analyze polytropic fluids $p=\\mathcal{K}\n\\rho^{\\Gamma}$ with $\\Gamma=5/3$ and $\\Gamma=4/3$, observing similar\nqualitative behavior, where the sonic transition is affected by both the\nequation of state and the LV parameter.

Many approaches\nhave been proposed to mitigate or avoid the barren plateau phenomenon or, more\nbroadly, exponential concentration. However, due to the intricate interplay\nbetween quantum measurements and classical post-processing, we argue these\ntechniques often fail to circumvent concentration effects in practice. Here, by\nanalyzing concentration at the level of measurement outcome probabilities and\nleveraging tools from hypothesis testing, we develop a practical framework for\ndiagnosing whether a parameterized quantum model is inhibited by exponential\nconcentration. Applying this framework, we argue that several widely used\nmethods (including quantum natural gradient, sample-based optimization, and\ncertain neural-network-inspired initializations) do not overcome exponential\nconcentration with finite measurement budgets, though they may still aid\ntraining in other ways.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper addresses the challenge of scalable circuit architectures in variational quantum computing and machine learning, focusing on the barren plateau and concentration phenomena.
