Abstract: The transition from rotational to discontinuous behavior of the return map of
the perturbed oscillators-step system, a paradigm model for a perturbation of a
pseudo-integrable Hamiltonian impact system, is studied. The form of the return
map is derived, and a truncated form of this map is simulated and analyzed. For
a set of parameters the existence of a hovering set, a set of non-resonant
orbits that pass sometimes above the step and sometimes to its side, without
ever impacting it, is established and quantified. Its destruction as the sign
of the perturbation term is reversed is established.

Abstract: Understanding inner-shell decay processes in heavy-element molecules is
essential for unraveling x-ray-induced photodynamics and advancing molecular
imaging techniques. In this study, we investigate the influence of atomic
substitution on core-hole relaxation dynamics and molecular fragmentation in
Br2 and IBr, initiated by x-ray absorption at the Br K-edge. Using a
combination of X-ray/ion coincidence measurements and Monte Carlo/molecular
dynamics simulations, we track charge distribution and the kinetic energy
release (KER) of fragment ions with a total charge from 2+ to 8+. For both
molecules, the simulated KER values show good agreement with experiment across
different fragmentation channels. Our comparison reveals that substituting Br
with the heavier I atom in IBr has minimal impact on the inner-shell electronic
decay process, but significantly influences nuclear motion, leading to slower
dissociation, thereby a KER close to the Coulomb limit, an effect attributed to
the atomic mass. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and
nuclear effects in molecular fragmentation, particularly in heavy-element
species, and provide new insights into medical therapies, structural biology,
and astrophysics.

### [3] [Attosecond electron bunch generation by an intense high-order harmonic pulse interacting with a thin target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24775)
*Yang He,Mamat Ali Bake,Cheng-Qi Zhang,Bai-Song Xie*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: This research presents a method to generate ultrashort electron bunches with excellent temporal resolution, enabling advanced high-energy and attosecond physics experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for ultrafast electron bunches with high temporal resolution for advanced physics experiments.

Method: Using high-harmonics generated by laser-plasma interaction to create a driving pulse, which interacts with a thin target to produce an attosecond electron bunch.

Result: Generated electron bunch with excellent collimation, ultra-short duration (100 attoseconds), 0.38 nC charge, and low emittance. Optimize simulation parameters for systematic analysis of laser intensity and target positioning.

Conclusion: Robust foundation established for generating ultrashort electron bunches, opening new research prospects in high-energy and attosecond physics.

Abstract: Laser-accelerated electron bunches and the secondary radiation sources they
produce exhibit unique temporal resolution for probing ultrafast physical
processes due to their ultrashort pulse duration. The inherently short temporal
profile of these pulses leads to extremely high peak bunch currents, thereby
enabling a wide range of practical applications. In this study, we propose an
innovative method for generating such bunch by utilizing high-harmonics
generated through laser-plasma interaction as the driving pulse, which
subsequently interacts with a thin target to produce an attosecond electron
bunch. Using this method, we successfully generated an electron bunch
characterized by excellent collimation and an ultra-short duration of
approximately 100 attoseconds, representing a substantial reduction in bunch
duration. The total bunch charge achieved was 0.38 nC, with an emittance of
$4.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mm} \cdot \text{mrad}$ and a divergence angle of
approximately $10^\circ$. Moreover, by systematically analyzing the effects of
laser intensity and target positioning, we determined an optimized set of
simulation parameters. This research establishes a robust foundation for the
generation of ultrashort electron bunches and opens new prospects for their
application in advanced high-energy and attosecond physics experiments.

Conclusion: 固有磁矩与外加磁场的相互作用在冷域中表现出 важ的行为特征

Abstract: We study experimentally and theoretically optical absorption spectra of
neodymium ferroborate in the temperature range $6-32$ K. We show that the
temperature dependences of integral intensities of absorption lines demonstrate
qualitatively different behavior for $\sigma$- and $\pi$-polarizations of the
light. We suggest that this behavior may be caused by the appearance of a
spiral magnetic structure in the compound under study. To describe the
temperature dependences of lines intensities we propose a theoretical model
which takes into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between
Nd$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ ions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new cryogenic cooling system for JEOL S/TEM that enables ultra-low temperature imaging and spectroscopy, with applications in quantum materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop advanced cryogenic systems for electron microscopy to study low-temperature quantum phenomena in materials.

Method: The method involves installing a side-entry condenZero system using compressed liquid helium, featuring an external dewar, vibration-damping stage, and a novel helium transfer line with a remote control valve for stable LHe flow.

Result: The system achieved a stable base temperature of 6.58 K with minimal fluctuations, allowing successful imaging and spectroscopy of phenomena like charge density waves and magnetic skyrmions.

Conclusion: This system provides a reliable platform for directly observing electronic and magnetic phase transformations in quantum materials at ultra-low temperatures.

Abstract: Advances in cryogenic electron microscopy have opened new avenues for probing
quantum phenomena in correlated materials. This study reports the installation
and performance of a new side-entry condenZero cryogenic cooling system for
JEOL (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopes (S/TEM), utilizing compressed
liquid helium (LHe) and designed for imaging and spectroscopy at ultra-low
temperatures. The system includes an external dewar mounted on a
vibration-damping stage and a pressurized, low-noise helium transfer line with
a remotely controllable needle valve, ensuring stable and efficient LHe flow
with minimal thermal and mechanical noise. Performance evaluation demonstrates
a stable base temperature of 6.58 K measured using a Cernox bare chip sensor on
the holder with temperature fluctuations within 0.04 K. Complementary in-situ
electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) via aluminum bulk plasmon analysis was
used to measure the local specimen temperature and validate cryogenic operation
during experiments. The integration of cryogenic cooling with other microscopy
techniques, including electron diffraction and Lorentz TEM, was demonstrated by
resolving charge density wave (CDW) transitions in NbSe2 using electron
diffraction, and imaging nanometric magnetic skyrmions in MnSi via Lorentz TEM.
This platform provides reliable cryogenic operation below 7 K, establishing a
low-drift route for direct visualization of electronic and magnetic phase
transformations in quantum materials.

### [6] [Monte Carlo Diagonalization for Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22975)
*B. Bernard,M. Charlebois*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Hubbard model has often been studied with exact diagonalization (ED).
This impurity solver is fundamentally limited by the exponential scaling of the
Fock space. To address this problem, we introduce Monte Carlo diagonalization.
Using a truncated Fock space constructed with a Monte Carlo approach, we reduce
the size of the basis required to represent the Hamiltonian. We can then apply
the Lanczos and band Lanczos algorithms in this truncated basis to find the
ground state and the Green function. This results in a significant economy of
resources and the capacity to break the $\sim$20-site limit of ED. Our results
suggest that there is a threshold on the number of states needed to capture the
physics. This allows us to reach clusters of size up to 32 sites and reproduce
the expected physics.

### [7] [Hund's physics extends to actinide f electron systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23033)
*Byungkyun Kang,Roy N. Herrera-Navarro,Stephen S. Micklo,Mark R. Pederson,Eunja Kim*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Uranium mononitride (UN) exhibits bad-metallic transport despite its Uranium 5f electrons typically causing heavy-fermion behavior via Kondo screening. However, UN's behavior is best explained as a strongly correlated bad metal due to intra-atomic Hund's exchange interaction, which renormalizes the quasiparticle mass. This makes UN a 5f-electron analogue of a Hund's metal, similar to transition-metal d-systems. The research motivates further exploration of the interplay between Mott, Kondo, and Hund-driven correlations in actinide materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of a new material with unconventional electronic properties, particularly one that defies typical Kondo screening behavior, prompts further investigation into the mechanisms controlling correlated electron behavior in such systems.

Method: The study employs a combination of density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to model the electronic structure of UR. Calculations focus on the intra-atomic Hund's exchange interaction and its effects on the material's transport properties.

Result: UN is identified as a strongly correlated bad metal dominated by intra-atomic Hund's exchange interaction. This interaction leads to significant quasiparticle mass renormalization, characteristic of a 5f-electron system behaving as a Hund's metal.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of considering Hund's exchange interactions in understanding the electronic properties of actinide compounds. It suggests that similar effects could be present in other actinide materials, opening new avenues for materials science and condensed matter physics research.

Abstract: Uranium 5f electrons often yield heavy-fermion behavior via Kondo screening.
However, the pronounced bad-metallic transport of uranium mononitride (UN)
defies an incoherent Kondo explanation. Using density-functional theory
combined with dynamical mean-field theory, we show that UN is a strongly
correlated bad metal. The dominant correlations arise from intra-atomic Hund's
exchange interaction between two 5f electrons, which aligns local magnetic
moments and produces large quasiparticle mass renormalization. This identifies
UN as a 5f-electron analogue of a Hund's metal-a paradigm chiefly associated
with transition-metal d systems. Our results motivate a re-examination of the
interplay between Mott, Kondo, and Hund-driven correlations across actinide
correlated materials.

### [8] [Splitting of electronic spectrum in paramagnetic phase of itinerant ferromagnets and altermagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23396)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study self-energy effects, induced by strong magnetic fluctuations in
paramagnetic phase of strongly-correlated itinerant magnets within the density
functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT
approach) and its non-local extension. As concrete examples, we consider
$\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and
altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations
yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that
it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase and suppresses
spectral weight at the Fermi level. The relative importance of non-local vs.
local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states:
closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the
obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting
suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states
are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic
field.

### [9] [Revealing a hidden magnetic order in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet CuNdO$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23523)
*Jonathan Gaudet,Dalmau Reig-i-Plessis,Bogeng Wen,Thomas J. Hicken,Jonas A. Krieger,Jan Peter Embs,Hubertus Luetkens,Adam A. Aczel,Stuart A. Calder,Matthew B. Stone,Hae-Young Kee,Alannah M. Hallas*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR:  investigations of CuNdO$_2$ revealed that Nd$^{3+}$ ions form an Ising antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice, with long-range order at 0.78 K. Neutron diffraction showed no dipole order, but a weak spin wave excitation was observed. The magnetic moments mostly lie perpendicular, with a near 120-degree structure in-plane. The magnetic behavior is due to the strong Ising-like interactions and geometric frustration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the magnetic ground states of materials with geometrically frustrated lattices is crucial for exploring exotic magnetic phases and potential applications in spintronics and quantum materials.

Method: The study used inelastic neutron scattering, magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, muon spin relaxation, and neutron diffraction to investigate the magnetic properties of CuNdO$_2$.

Result: The key findings include the identification of a long-range antiferromagnetic order with Ising-like behavior, the absence of dipole-ordered moments, and the in-plane reorientation of magnetic moments into a 120-degree structure.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into magnetic frustrations and the competition between different magnetic components in frustrated triangular lattice systems.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state of CuNdO$_2$, which is a delafossite
with a triangular lattice of magnetic Nd$^{3+}$ ions that are well separated by
non-magnetic Cu spacer layers. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements
of the crystal electric field, we determine the strong Ising character of the
pseudo-spin $\frac{1}{2}$ Nd$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat
capacity measurements reveal the onset of long-range antiferromagnetic order at
$T_N=0.78$ K. While the magnetic transition is definitively observed with muon
spin relaxation, accompanied by the formation of a weakly dispersing spin wave
excitation, no dipole-ordered moment is detected with neutron diffraction. We
show that the apparent absence of a dipolar ordered moment is a consequence of
the dominant Ising character of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments, which experience extreme
frustration on the triangular lattice. Consequently, the frustration in
CuNdO$_2$ is relieved through in-plane ordering of the substantially smaller
perpendicular component of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments into a 120\textdegree\
structure, with a nearly vanishing ordered moment.

Conclusion: 提出的三轨道Hubbard模型成功描述了高温轨道选择性金属相及其标度性性质，为强相互作用金属态提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Quantum materials whose properties lie beyond the celebrated Landau
Fermi-liquid paradigm have been observed for decades across diverse material
platforms. Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit
such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features
often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting
electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a
high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an
orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field
theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we
chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency
dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law)
single-particle spectra and asymptotic $\omega/T$ scaling in both charge and
spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ near two-degree twists has emerged as a platform for
exotic correlated topological phases, including ferromagnetism and a
non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator. Here we reveal the unexpected
emergence of an intervalley superconducting phase that intervenes between these
two states in the half-filled second moir\'{e} bands. Using a continuum model
and exact diagonalization, we identify superconductivity through multiple
signatures: negative binding energy, a dominant pair-density eigenvalue, finite
superfluid stiffness, and pairing symmetry consistent with a
time-reversal-symmetric nodal extended $s$-wave state. Remarkably, our
numerical calculation suggests a continuous transition between
superconductivity and the non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator, in which
topology and symmetry evolve simultaneously, supported by an effective
field-theory description. Our results establish higher moir\'{e} bands as
fertile ground for intertwined superconductivity and topological order, and
point to experimentally accessible routes for realizing superconductivity in
twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$.

Abstract: Weak localization of bosons can give rise to an exotic quantum phase known as
a Bose glass, characterized by the absence of global phase coherence yet finite
conductivity. This phase is crucial in understanding the interplay between
disorder, interactions, and superconductivity, especially in two-dimensional
and strongly correlated systems. Here we report the presence of the Bose glass
phase in the weak localization region of ruthenium oxide Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. The
electrical resistance exhibits a characteristic logarithmic temperature
dependence in this phase, $\rho \sim \ln(1/T)$. Through $\beta$-function
scaling analysis, we observed "vertical flow" indicating unconventional scaling
behavior associated with localized bosonic states. Our results suggest the
existence of bosons-Cooper pairs-persisting up to high temperatures around 220
K and that these bosons undergo weak localization. In the Bose glass phase,
vortices are found to have a dual relationship with the localized Cooper pairs,
enabling their motion and resulting in finite resistance despite the presence
of bosonic order. We identified two quantum critical points: one between the
Bose glass and superconducting phases and another between the Bose glass and
Mott insulating phases, allowing us to extract the corresponding quantum sheet
resistances. We revealed that the ground state of the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ changes
depending on the localization strength. Thinning the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ corresponds
to controlling the electronic correlation by relieving the distortion in
RuO$_6$ octahedra. These findings offer significant insights into the interplay
between electronic correlations and bosonic transport, with important
implications for studying high-temperature superconductors based on perovskite
structures.

Result: 在 Hubbard 模型中，随着 doping 和温度降低，出现自旋条纹，其周期长度与 doping 间非线性关系显著，且对邻近和次邻近跳跃比例非常敏感。

Conclusion: 通过DMFT方法求解 Bethe-Salpeter方程，发现 Hubbard模型中Hubbard模型中自旋条纹的存在及其周期长度随 doping 和next-nearest neighbor hopping比的变化，为Understanding cuprates 物理提供了新见解。

Abstract: The Hubbard model is known to accommodate various electronic orders,
including stripes, which are important for understanding the physics of
cuprates. We study spin-stripe order in the square lattice Hubbard model as a
function of doping and temperature, by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with
the local vertex from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), both inside and
outside the antiferromagnetic phase. We find broad regions of
horizontal/vertical spin stripes at low temperatures for the model with and
without next-nearest neighbor hopping. Their wavelength depends on hole doping
in a nonlinear fashion, and is highly sensitive to the ratio of nearest and
next-nearest neighbor hoppings.

Abstract: The organic conductor $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ provides the prime example
of a charge-order-driven metal-insulator transition. Restricted chemical
substitution of S atoms by Se in the constituent molecules allows us to modify
the electronic properties. This not only decreases the transition temperature
but, in addition, alters the phase transition mechanism, resulting in the
ground state deviating from the charge-ordered insulator state of the parent
compound. Employing infrared optical spectroscopy, we investigate changes in
the charge dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the absence of charge ordering
in the Se-substituted materials and suggest that the phase transition is
instead driven by the localization of the itinerant charge carriers due to
strong electron-phonon interactions.

Abstract: The supermoir\'e lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moir\'e
patterns, dramatically reshapes the electronic band structure by introducing
new minibands and modifying band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic
interactions within moir\'e flat bands lead to the emergence of various
correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoir\'e lattice on the flat
band systems with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we

### [16] [WTMAD-4: A Fair Weighting Scheme for GMTKN55](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23498)
*Kyle R. Bryenton,Erin R. Johnson*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper identifies a flaw in the Wtmad metric used to evaluate electronic-structure methods for the Gmtkn55 dataset, showing that some benchmarks are under-weighted. A new metric, wtmad-4, is proposed to better account for typical errors in well-behaved density-functional approximations (dfas). The study evaluates 135 dispersion-corrected dfas using literature and new results, highlighting that some methods perform poorly when weights are based on wtmad-2 but perform well under wtmad-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the evaluation of electronic-structure methods is crucial for advancing computational chemistry and materials science. the gmtkn55 dataset is a widely used benchmark, so any improvements in its evaluation metrics would have significant implications.

Method: the authors identified the flaw in the wtmad metric by analyzing its under-weighting of certain benchmarks. they then proposed wtmad-4, which incorporates typical errors observed in dfas. the study evaluates 135 methods by combining literature data with new results from the fhi-aims code.

Result: 135 dispersion-corrected dfas are evaluated, and it is shown that some methods perform well under wtmad-4 but poorly when evaluated using wtmad-2. this demonstrates the importance of choosing appropriate weightings in performance metrics.

Conclusion: the wtmad-4 metric provides a fairer evaluation of electronic-structure methods compared to the existing wtmad-2. this study offers a new standard for evaluating dfas on the gmtkn55 dataset, which is expected to guide future research in computational chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: The GMTKN55 data set is a collection of standard benchmarks used in molecular
quantum chemistry that spans small- and large-molecule thermochemistry,
reaction barriers, and non-covalent interactions. Herein, we identify a flaw in
the weighted mean absolute deviation (WTMAD) definitions commonly used to
quantify performance of various electronic-structure methods for the GMTKN55
set, which under-weight some of its component benchmarks by orders of
magnitude. A new WTMAD-4 metric is proposed, based on typical errors observed
for well-behaved density-functional approximations (DFAs), ensuring fair
treatment across all benchmarks. The performance of 135 dispersion-corrected
DFAs is assessed by combining literature data with new results for 20 minimally
empirical methods, primarily involving the exchange-hole dipole moment and
many-body dispersion corrections, available in the FHI-aims code. Lastly, we
highlight a literature example where a DFA parametrised by minimising WTMAD-2
underperforms for benchmarks marginalised by that metric.

Result: 电化学催化的水分解效率高于微波催化，且双桥构型对提高效率有帮助

Conclusion: 电化学催化的水分解在氢能源制取中具有潜在应用价值，但需要进一步研究以优化条件和性能。

Abstract: Protonated methane, CH5+, is a highly fluxional molecule with large spatial
motions of the hydrogen atoms. The molecule's anharmonic effects and the
scrambling of the hydrogen atoms significantly affect the excitation spectrum
of the molecule. The neural canonical transformation (NCT) approach, which we
previously developed to solve the vibrational spectra of molecules and solids,
is a powerful method that effectively treats nuclear quantum effects and
anharmonicities. Using NCT with wavefunctions in atomic coordinates rather than
normal coordinates, we successfully calculate the ground and excited states of
CH5+. We found that the wavefunctions for the ground state, as well as for low-
and high-energy excited states, show preferences for the three stationary
points on the potential energy surface. Furthermore, the dynamics of all these
states are characterized by continuous hydrogen swapping. This work extends the
applicability of the NCT approach for calculating excited states to fluxional
molecules without fixed geometry.

Motivation: 研究光合系统I的光能转移机制对理解光合进化和适应性具有重要意义。

Method: 使用了 cryogenic 电子光谱测量和时间非局域 master 方程来分析光能转移动态。

Abstract: Photosystem I converts light into chemical energy with near-unity quantum
efficiency,yet its energy-transfer and charge-separation mechanisms remain
debated. Evolution has diversified PSI architectures. The unicellular red algae
Cyanidioschyzon merolae represents a key evolutionary intermediate,featuring a
cyanobacterial-like monomeric core surrounded by three to five LHCR subunits.
This hybrid organization provides a unique system to bridge mechanistic models
across lineages. We applied two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy at ultralow
temperatures to disentangle overlapping excitation pathways in C. merolae PSI.
Cryogenic measurements suppressed thermal broadening, resolving five dynamical
components: sub-picosecond equilibration acrossthe core-LHCR interface,
subsequent population transfer into progressively lowerenergy manifolds, and
slower feeding into red pools distributed across both core and antenna. On the
longest timescales, a persistent ground-state bleach signifies excitons
stabilised in terminal sinks. Notably, comparison of 8 K and 80 K spectra
reveals that excitations are heterogeneously partitioned among multiple sinks
at low disorder, whereas modest thermal activation promotes selective
convergence into core-associated red chlorophylls. To interpret these dynamics,
we employed atomistic excitonic Hamiltonians with time-nonlocal master
equations, providing a quantitative framework for exciton migration and thermal
redistribution. Together, these results demonstrate that C. merolae PSI
broadens the kinetic funnel by distributing sinks across core and antenna, an
evolutionary adaptation that extends spectral coverage whilst ensuring
efficient trapping. These insights reconcile cyanobacterial and plant paradigms
and illuminate how antenna expansion reshaped PSI function during the course of
photosynthetic evolution.

TL;DR: 研究高压化学反应动力学的方法受到限制。我们使用了大体积压（LVP）技术和 synchrotron 辐射原位 X 射线成像技术，完成了高压力固态金属互化反应（HSM）中铁基球状产物形成的关键信息。结果显示，在高压下，存在氮含量的熔融硼ate（Fe[BO]+N[BO]）熔体的形成，并且铁氮化物的相分离。该过程揭示了非金属离子与金属元素的交换和合成金属氮化物的通路，为高压化学反应动力学提供了直接证据。

Motivation: 高压化学反应动力学的研究在实验上一直面临挑战，缺乏有效的原位表征方法，因此开发先进实验技术以揭示反应动力学机制至关重要。

Method: 我们使用了大体积压（LVP）技术和 synchrotron 辐射原位 X 射线成像技术，通过分析熔融硼ate和铁氮化物的相分离过程，揭示了铁氧核在高压下的动态行为。

Result: 通过实验观察，我们首次在高压条件下直接证实了氮含量的熔融硼ate（Fe[BO]+N[BO]）的形成，以及非金属离子与金属元素交换的关键作用。此外，我们还发现了通用的paths 对合成金属氮化物在高压条件下具有意义。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解高压化学反应动力学和开发高效合成方法提供了新的见解，实验结合了 LVP 成型技术和 synchrotron 辐射 X 射线成像技术，显著提升了对反应动力学的了解。

Abstract: The investigation of high-pressure chemical reaction dynamics has long been
constrained by the absence of effective in-situ characterization methods. Here
we performed the state-of-the-art synchrotron radiation in-situ X-ray imaging
based on large-volume press (LVP) technology to uncover the crucial information
on the dynamics of the underlying phenomena of the formation of iron-based
spherical product in the high-pressure solid-state metathesis reaction (HSM).
We successfully give access to the entire reduction-nitridation process of
ferric oxide under the reaction conditions. By analyzing the variation of image
intensity (Im) with temperature, two critical stages have been revealed, the
formation of nitrogen-containing molten borate Fe[BO]+N[BO] melt and the phase
separation of iron nitrides from molten borate. The experimental observation
provides direct evidence for the existence of nitrogen-containing molten borate
under high pressure, and the formation of molten borate plays a crucial role as
a transport medium for nonmetallic ion exchange with metal elements. The
M[BO]+N[BO] melt (M=other metals) represents a general pathway for the
synthesis of metal nitrides under high pressure. The combination of LVP
high-pressure experimental technology with X-ray radioscopy has resulted in a
leap in the understanding of reaction dynamics and has opened new paths in the
fields of high-pressure chemistry.

### [21] [n-alkanoate + n-alkane mixtures: folding of hydrocarbon chains of n-alkanoates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24589)
*Juan Antonio González,Fernando Hevia,Luis Felipe Sanz,Daniel Lozano-Martín,Isaías García de la Fuente,José Carlos Cobos*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Mixture of beta-keto esters and n-alkanes shows moderate structural changes influenced by steric hindrance and interactional effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how beta-keto esters and n-alkane mixtures interact over a range of relative proportions.

Method: Experimental data (viscosity, excess molar functions: enthalpy, volume, isobaric heat capacity, and isochoric internal energy) and models (Flory, Grunberg-Nissan, Bloomfield-Dewan) are applied to investigate structural changes.

Result: The results indicate that structural changes are influenced by both steric hindrance (COO group) and interactional effects. Decrease in excess volume (n) has different dependencies on the positions of u and v. A minimum in UVM(i,, at n for cyclic structures is observed, suggesting that some n-alkanoates can form quasi-cyclic structures in the mixture. Viscosity is primarily affected by free volume and cyclic structures are supported by the excess internal energy and viscosity data. The Flory model does not perform well when applied to Hel Cargo functions, but improves when applied to UVM(i,i).

Conclusion: The study concludes that n-alkane concentrations affect the structural properties significantly in beta-keto ester n-alkane mixture systems, and molecular models must be carefully selected based on the property of interest.

Abstract: The mixtures CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_{u-1}$COO(CH$_2$)$_{v-1}$CH$_3$ ($u=5-13$,
$v=1,2$; $u=1,2,3$, $v=3,4$; $u=1,2,4$, $v=5$) + n-alkane have been
investigated using experimental data (viscosity and excess molar functions:
enthalpy, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, volume, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$,
isobaric heat capacity, and isochoric internal energy,
$U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and models (Flory, Grunberg-Nissan,
Bloomfield-Dewan). They are characterized by weak orientational effects. Large
structural effects are found in some systems, like those containing pentane.
Some considerations from standard enthalpies of vaporization, cohesive energy
densities and $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ of heptane mixtures reveal the
existence of structural changes in longer n-alkanoates, which lead to stronger
interactions between them. The observed decrease of $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$
for systems with a given n-alkane seems to be more related to the steric
hindrance of the COO group than to interactional effects. The
$U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$ function ($n=$ number of C atoms in the n-alkane)
shows a minimum for systems with esters with ($u\geq4$, $v=1$); ($u\geq7$,
$v=2$), or ($u\geq 1$, $v=4,5$). A similar dependence was found for n-alkane
mixtures involving cyclic molecules (cyclohexane, benzene). This result
suggests that certain n-alkanoates, in an alkane medium, can form quasi-cyclic
structures. Viscosities are well described by means of free volume effects
only. For systems with butyl ethanoate or methyl decanoate, the variation of
$\Delta \eta (n)$ (deviation of dynamic viscosity) is consistent with that of
$U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$, which supports the existence of cyclic
structures in these esters. The Flory model provides poor results on
$H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ for systems with large structural effects. Results
improve when the model is applied to $U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$ data.

### [22] [Angular Resolution Enhancement of Electron Backscatter Diffraction Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23039)
*Ben Britton,Tianbi Zhang*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: A new technique to improve angular resolution in EBSD using sub-pixel image registration and pattern merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving angular resolution in Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) is crucial for enhancing the quality of structural information obtained from thin metal films and coatings.

Method: The method involves using sub-pixel image registration to measure subtle differences in projection parameters between EBSD patterns. These patterns are then shifted and added together using a 'shift-and-add' technique to enhance angular resolution.

Result: The resultant EBSD-pattern provides more angular information compared to a single long-exposure pattern. This improvement is validated through 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis, indicating better resolution and detail extraction.

Conclusion: This method offers a promising approach for integrating EBSD with sub-pixel image registration, particularly for small compact direct electron detectors (DEDs).

Abstract: We present a simple 'shift-and-add' based improvement in the angular
resolution of single electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns.
Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in
projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern
is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain
more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis. In particular, this method has the
potential to enhance the scope of small compact direct electron detectors
(DEDs).

Abstract: The search for primordial B-modes in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
requires highly sensitive and scalable detector systems. The magnetic
microbolometer (MMB) is an emerging detector concept that exploits the magnetic
properties of paramagnetic materials at sub-kelvin temperatures, offering
bolometers with a high dynamic range and low intrinsic noise. In recent years,
the microwave SQUID multiplexer ($\mu$MUX) has become a key technology to
efficiently read large low temperature detector arrays, enabling the readout of
hundreds to thousands of detectors over a single transmission line with low
noise and minimal power dissipation while reducing the cryogenic setup
complexity. In this work, we report the design, fabrication and
characterization of a $\mu$MUX optimized for MMB detectors and share our latest
experimental results from a bolometer prototype. These findings provide
valuable insight of the $\mu$MUX in advancing next-generation CMB
instrumentation and also demonstrate its suitability for novel detector

{\mu}MUX readout, focusing on bolometric applications. Finally, the minimum
demodulated flux noise was obtained through the optimally conditioned readout
of a {\mu}MUX channel. The results presented are comparable to those obtained
with traditional SDR architectures and demonstrate that the Direct-RF SDR

Abstract: Integrating biology with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
sensors can enable highly parallel measurements with minimal parasitic effects,
significantly enhancing sensitivity. However, realizing this potential often
requires overcoming substantial barriers related to design, fabrication, and
heterogeneous integration. In this context, we present a comprehensive suite of
tools and methods designed for wafer-scale biosensor prototyping that is
sensitive, highly parallelizable, and manufacturable. A central component of
our approach is a new initiative that allows for open-source multi-project
wafers (MPW), giving all participants access to the designs submitted by
others. We demonstrate that this strategy not only promotes design reuse but
also facilitates advanced back-end-of-line (BEOL) fabrication techniques,
improving the manufacturability and process yield of CMOS biosensors.
Developing CMOS-based biosensors also involves the challenge of heterogeneous
integration, which includes external electrical, mechanical, and fluid layers.
We demonstrate simple modular designs that enable such integration for sample
delivery and signal readout. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our
approach in measuring the hybridization of DNA molecules by focusing on data
acquisition and machine learning (ML) methods that leverage the parallelism of
the sensors to enable robust classification of desirable analyte interactions.

Conclusion: 通过实验室μXRF系统实现在常温下精确检测CTMP纤维中的硫分布，为开发高效环保的纤维基包装材料提供了关键技术支撑。

Abstract: The transition toward renewable, fiber-based packaging requires an improved
understanding of chemical modifications in high-yield pulps such as
chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the
energy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory
methods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the
fiber level, which can be visualized using $\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present
a laboratory $\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its
capability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets. A 32 $\times$ 32
point grid scan (1.6-1.6 mm$^2$ field of view, 50 $\mu$m step, 300 s/point)
successfully resolved sulfur K$\alpha$ (2.31 keV) and calcium K$\alpha$ (3.69
keV) fluorescence without helium flushing. Comparative measurements at the
Elettra synchrotron confirmed consistency of sulfur peak position and spatial
distribution, with higher spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.
Histogram analysis using Wasserstein distance metrics demonstrated close
agreement between datasets despite differing acquisition conditions. These
results demonstrate that laboratory XRF can reproducibly detect and map sulfur
in CTMP fibers under ambient conditions, providing a practical tool to
complement synchrotron studies and supporting the development of
energy-efficient, fiber-based packaging materials.

Motivation: Imaging gamma-ray events accurately in the MeV-TeV range for astrophysical studies.

Method: Developed a high dynamic range readout using dual APDs and a high-granular BGO prototype.

Result: Achieved 1e6 dynamic range, improved energy and particle resolution.

Conclusion: Optimal VLAST calorimeter design achieved for gamma-ray astronomy.

Abstract: Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is the next-generation
flagship space observatory for high-energy gamma-ray detection proposed by
China. The observation energy range covers from MeV to TeV and beyond, with
acceptance of 10 m^2sr. The calorimeter serves as a crucial subdetector of
VLAST, responsible for high-precision energy measurement and electron/proton
discrimination. This discrimination capability is essential for accurately
identifying gamma-ray events among the background of charged particles. To
accommodate such an extensive energy range, a high dynamic range readout scheme
employing dual avalanche photodiodes (APDs) has been developed, achieving a
remarkable dynamic range of 10^6. Furthermore, a high granular prototype based
on bismuth germanate (BGO) cubic scintillation crystals has been developed.
This high granularity enables detailed imaging of the particle showers,
improving both energy resolution and particle identification. The prototype's
performance is evaluated through cosmic ray testing, providing valuable data
for optimizing the final calorimeter design for VLAST.

TL;DR: We developed a modular, open-source framework that helps real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments at synchrotron light sources, with AI-driven data acquisition and analysis to optimize measurement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal characterization of complex functional materials at synchrotron light sources requires efficient and optimal use of experimental data to guide measurements, but current practices often neglect this opportunity. The motivation is to streamline and enhance this process through AI techniques.

Method: We developed a framework that integrates AI agents for real-time data acquisition and analysis, specifically performing reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modeling, and Bayesian optimization. The framework enables dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional strategies, utilizing the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure.

Result: The framework successfully mapped combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system using X-ray diffraction and absorption measurements. AI-driven strategies outperformed conventional methods by prioritizing measurements that better resolve phase boundaries and localized minority phases, as demonstrated by a digital twin constructed from an Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset.

Conclusion: This framework enhances efficiency and effectiveness in multi-modal material characterization, paving the way for routine AI-assisted operations at synchrotron facilities.

Abstract: High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional
materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at
synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use
of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven
insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework
that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data
streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of
multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly
reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization
driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize
results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were
spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure
measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching
between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved,
demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital
twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven
mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling
by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and
localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities,
and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale
user-facility operations.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates combining acoustic metamaterials and active noise control for improved noise control over a specific area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance noise control through a hybrid approach of two advanced noise control techniques.

Method: The method involves combining conventional feedforward active noise control with a labyrinthine metasurface.

Result: The result demonstrates an increase in performance offered by the hybrid solution.

Conclusion: The study successfully combines the two techniques to achieve enhanced noise control over a spatial region using a hybrid device.

Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials and active noise control are two advanced noise
control treatments that can typically offer performance that exceeds that of
conventional passive noise control treatments. Acoustic metamaterials utilize
sub-wavelength structures to realize sound field control, whilst active noise
control treatments achieve control via the introduction of additional sources
driven to generate a secondary sound field that interferes in a controlled way
with the original, primary sound field. This paper presents an investigation
into combining these two noise control techniques, to achieve enhanced noise
control over a spatial region using a hybrid device. In particular,
conventional feedforward active noise control is combined with a labyrinthine
metasurface and the increase in performance offered by the hybrid solution is
demonstrated.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Silicon, despite its abundance and high energy density, remains underexplored
as a carbon-free fuel, with limited data available on its combustion
characteristics. In this work, the combustion behaviour of silicon particles is
examined using an electrostatic levitator with laser ignition. Five oxidizing
environments at atmospheric pressure are investigated: air, pure oxygen, and
mixtures containing 40% oxygen (by mole) diluted with nitrogen, helium, or
argon. The burning droplet peak temperature, measured by three-colour
pyrometry, increases by 337 K from air to pure oxygen. The peak temperature of
the silicon droplet in the 40%O2-60%He mixture is lower than that in the
40%O2-60%Ar mixture, in contradiction with thermodynamic predictions, due to a
higher Lewis number of the helium-diluted mixture. Although oxygen diffusivity
is higher in the helium-diluted mixture, a lower burning rate is observed,
attributed to the lower combustion temperature. High-speed colour camera
observations reveal that the square of the particle diameter decreases with
time in each combustion run, following a strong linear relationship (R2 > 0.99)
across all oxidizing environments. However, the combustion lifetime is
proportional to the initial particle diameter to the power of n, with n ranging
from 1.69 to 1.82. This deviation from the expected n = 2 appears to result
from unavoidable measurement uncertainties and the limited particle size range,
rather than differences in combustion physics. The decrease in silicon droplet
size during combustion is attributed to the formation of gaseous SiO as an
intermediate combustion product. The SiO species is observed using a UV camera,
showing a UV intensity decay from the particle surface. High-speed imaging and
LED absorption signals indicate that the final condensed product, SiO2
nanoparticles, are not optically visible, suggesting they possess very low
emissivity.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in utilizing spin-wave transducers for radio-frequency applications by focusing on their intrinsic properties, such as tunability, scalability, and nonlinearity.

Method: The authors conducted experimental analysis, developed an analytic model, and tested different transducer geometries to assess EM impact and optimize performance.

Result: The model accurately predicts passband ripple effects, and modifying the transducer geometry improves functionality.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of minimizing EM crosstalk for better performance and leverages the nonlinear properties of spin-waves for potential applications.

Abstract: Utilization of spin-wave transducers for radio-frequency signal processing
provides significant potential due to intrinsic tunability, scalability and
nonlinearity. However, such components can exhibit passband ripples diminishing
their operation and functionality. Here, we experimentally identify the
electromagnetic crosstalk (EM) as a major source of passband ripples and
provide a simple analytic model to predict the impact on device operation. The
results are in good agreement with the experimental observation. In addition,
we test multiple transducer geometries to identify operational regimes and
minimize the EM impact. Finally, the effect of nonlinear device operation on
the passband ripples is addressed, which is of relevance for the exploitation
of the spin-waves intrinsic nonlinear traits.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the apparent thermality of Hawking radiation in the
semi-classical limit of quantum black holes using the mean-field limit of a
chiral spin-chain simulator, which models fermions propagating on a black hole
space-time in the continuum. In this free-theory regime, no genuine
thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the
event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an
apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from
the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true
equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal
only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal
behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole
interior.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It has been established in both high and low spacetime dimensions that
existing constructions of entanglement islands, at least in the study of black
holes, are all in the context of massive gravity. In fact, later studies
realized that the graviton mass is not an accident and it is necessary for the
consistency of the holographic interpretation for entanglement islands. An
important lesson we learned from these studies is that the graviton mass is a
manifestation of the deep relationship between quantum entanglement and
emergent geometry (EPR=ER). Nevertheless, various interesting questions and
counter-arguments exist regarding whether this connection is of any relevance,
either by modifying the definition of entanglement islands or denying the
graviton mass as a physically relevant concept. In this paper, we will revisit
the necessity of graviton mass for the consistency of entanglement islands and
address the above questions in and out of the literature. Since the
calculations in higher dimensions are already well understood, we will start
with a demonstration of massive islands in a frequently used lower dimensional
model, AdS$_{2}$ Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled with transparent
conformal matter fields, for which the relationship between energy dissipation
and the graviton mass manifests. We will then discuss the necessity of graviton
mass for entanglement islands in general situations and clarify the physical
meaning of graviton mass. In the end, we will comment on the attempts to
construct entanglement islands in massless gravity and suggest the search for a
new type of entanglement wedges in holography.
  The purpose of this paper is to summarize the recent progress, clarifying
potential confusions and convey key messages to both experts and non-experts in
the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding modular invariance in string compactifications is crucial for constructing consistent effective theories and addressing questions in both swampland conjectures and flavor physics.

Method: The authors perform a two-moduli truncation of a string-inspired scalar potential, analyze its vacuum structure, and identify regions supporting quintessence models.

Result: The study finds a variety of vacua, including anti-de Sitter minima and de Sitter saddle points, and demonstrates quintessence scenarios that comply with swampland de Sitter bounds.

Conclusion: Modular symmetry plays a key role in guiding the construction of controlled quintessence scenarios within consistent effective theories, potentially offering new insights into dark energy and string theory dynamics.

Abstract: Modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry in string compactifications,
constraining both the structure of the effective theory and the dynamics of
moduli and matter fields. It has also gained renewed importance in the context
of swampland conjectures and, independently, flavour physics. We investigate a
modular-invariant scalar potential arising from heterotic orbifolds, where the
flavour structure and moduli dynamics are jointly shaped by the underlying
geometry. Focusing on a string-inspired, two-moduli truncation, we uncover a
rich vacuum structure featuring anti-de Sitter minima and unstable de Sitter
saddle points. We identify large regions in moduli space supporting multifield
hilltop quintessence consistent with observations. All solutions satisfy
refined swampland de Sitter bounds. Our results illustrate how modular symmetry
can guide the construction of controlled, string-motivated quintessence
scenarios within consistent effective theories.

### [36] [Gauging the Standard Model 1-form symmetry via gravitational instantons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22788)
*Mohamed M. Anber*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores the Standard Model's ℤ6(1) electric 1-form global symmetry in gravitational instanton backgrounds, specifically Eguchi-Hanson geometries. It reveals that these geometries support quantized ℤ6(1) fluxes localized on their S² bolt, inducing fractional topological charge without affecting the geometry. The paper demonstrates that quark and lepton wavefunctions must be globally well-defined under parallel transport, which removes ill-defined fermion zero modes. The surviving spectrum is confirmed through an explicit solution of the Dirac equation and the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. The Euclidean path integral in the EH background is interpreted as a transition amplitude from an entangled state between two identical halves of space to the vacuum. Summing over all ℤ6(1) flux sectors in the path integral gauges the SM 1-form symmetry, making it impossible to persist as an exact global symmetry in the semiclassical limit of gravity. Additionally, the paper shows that these fluxes induce baryon- and lepton-number violating processes, which are suppressed by the smallness of the hypercharge coupling constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the desire to understand the interplay between global symmetries in the Standard Model and gravitational instanton backgrounds. This is relevant in the context of quantum gravity and the structure of spacetime.

Method: The authors use a combination of gauge theory, differential geometry, and index theorems to analyze the symmetry in gravitational backgrounds. They employ the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem to compute the spectrum of fermions in the background of gravitational instantons.

Result: 1. Gravitational instantons support quantized ℤ6(1) fluxes localized on their S² bolts, inducing fractional topological charge. 2. The requirement of global well-defined wavefunctions removes ill-defined fermion zero modes. 3. The Euclidean path integral interpretation leads to the conclusion that the SM 1-form symmetry cannot persist as an exact symmetry in the semiclassical limit. 4. The fluxes induce baryon and lepton number violating processes, which are suppressed due to the small hypercharge coupling.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the persistence of global symmetries in gravitational backgrounds and suggest suppression of symmetry-violating processes via flux-induced couplings.

Abstract: We investigate the fate of the Standard Model (SM) $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$
electric $1$-form global symmetry in the background of gravitational
instantons, focusing on Eguchi-Hanson (EH) geometries. We show that EH
instantons support quantized $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ fluxes localized on their
$S^2$ bolt, inducing fractional topological charge without backreacting on the
geometry. The requirement that quark and lepton wavefunctions be globally
well-defined under parallel transport imposes boundary conditions, removing
ill-defined fermion zero modes; the surviving spectrum is confirmed by an
explicit solution of the Dirac equation and by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index
theorem. The Euclidean path integral in the EH background can be interpreted as
a transition amplitude from an entangled state between two identical halves of
space to the vacuum. Summing over all $\mathbb{Z}_6^{(1)}$ flux sectors in the
path integral gauges the SM $1$-form symmetry; thus, it cannot persist as an
exact global symmetry in the semiclassical limit of gravity. We further show
that these fluxes induce baryon- and lepton-number violating processes, which
are exponentially suppressed due to the smallness of the hypercharge coupling
constant.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to construct a gauge-invariant and symmetric extension of higher-spin gauge theory in $AdS_4$ while preserving local Lorentz symmetry, with applicability to diverse perturbative and extended higher-spin models.

Method: The method involves extending the BRST formalism to the higher-spin gauge theory in $AdS_4$ by incorporating the local Lorentz symmetry via the BRST operator.

Result: A satisfactory BRST extension of the higher-spin gauge theory in $AdS_4$ is achieved, which supports manifest local Lorentz covariance and is broadly applicable to different perturbative schemes and extended higher-spin models in $AdS3$ and $AdS4$.

Conclusion: The constructed BRST extension effectively addresses the challenges in maintaining local Lorentz covariance and symmetry in higher-spin gauge theories within $AdS_4$, providing a solid foundation for further extensions and applications.

Abstract: We propose a BRST extension of the higher-spin gauge theory in $AdS_4$ with
the BRST operator associated with the local Lorentz symmetry. Our construction
supports manifest local Lorentz covariance and is applicable both to any

differential homotopy and to the variety of further extended higher-spin models
in $AdS_3$ and $AdS_4$ with higher differential forms and Coxeter higher-spin

Motivation: The study of hydrodynamics, particularly in extreme conditions like relativistic systems, is motivated by the need for accurate theoretical frameworks to describe complex fluid dynamics.

Method: The research likely involved a combination of analytical techniques, including linearized stability analysis and constraints on dispersion relations, along with applications to kinetic theory and holographic models.

Result: The authors successfully developed causal theories of relativistic hydrodynamics, including applications to charged plasmas and superfluids, addressing the limitations of traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust foundation for causal relativistic hydrodynamics, offering significant advancements in understanding complex fluid systems across different physical contexts.

Abstract: The first-order textbook formulations of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics
are unstable and acausal. These shortcomings may be rectified by using
effective theories which maintain stability and causality. In this
dissertation, which is intended to also serve as an introduction to the field,
causal theories of relativistic hydrodynamics are developed and explored.
Conditions are obtained for a linearized analysis to predict the non-linear
causality of a theory, and constraints are found on short-wavelength dispersion
relations as a consequence of ensuring stability in all reference frames.
First-order causal theories of hydrodynamics are extracted from kinetic theory
and holography descriptions. Finally, causal theories describing charged
plasmas (one-form magnetohydrodynamics), and describing superfluids are
developed.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory on $X\times
S^1$, with $X$ a closed smooth four-manifold. A partial topological twisting
along $X$ renders the theory formally independent of the metric on $X$. The
theory depends on the spin structure and the circumference $R$ of $S^1$. The
coefficients of the $R$-expansion of the partition function are Witten indices,
which are identified with $L^2$-indices of Dirac operators on moduli spaces of
instantons. The partition function encodes BPS indices for instanton particles
on a spatial manifold $X$, and these indices are special cases of K-theoretic
Donaldson invariants. When the 't Hooft flux of the gauge theory is nonzero and
$X$ is not spin, the 5d theory can be anomalous, but this anomaly can be
canceled by coupling to a line bundle with connection for the global $U(1)$
``instanton number symmetry''. For $b_2^+(X)>0$ we can derive the partition
function from integration over the Coulomb branch of the effective 4d
low-energy theory. When $X$ is toric we can also use equivariant localization
with respect to the $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ symmetry. The two
methods lead to the same results for the wall-crossing formula. We also
determine path integrals for four-manifolds with $b_2^+(X)>1$. Our results
agree with those for algebraic surfaces by G\"ottsche, Kool, Nakajima,
Yoshioka, and Williams, but apply to a larger class of manifolds. When the
circumference of the circle is tuned to special values, the path integral is
associated with the 5d superconformal $E_1$ theory. Topological invariants in
this case involve generalizations of Seiberg-Witten invariants.

processes, i.e., nonempty bulk scattering region $S_0$. Recently, Liu and
Leutheusser proposed an enlarged bulk scattering region $S_E$ and conjectured
that the non-emptiness of $S_E$ fully characterizes the existence of $O(1/G_N)$
mutual information between decision regions. Here, we provide a geometrical or
general relativity proof for a slightly modified version of their conjecture.

Motivation: Understanding correlation functions of giant gravitons and half-BPS operators is key to exploring the AdS/CFT correspondence and verifying dualities like integrability. This paper advances these calculations and uncovers new symmetries.

Method: Combines the partially-contracted giant graviton method with $f{N}=2$ harmonic superspace formalism to perform two-loop computations. The approach simplifies perturbative calculations and extracts CFT data in the form of sum rules.

Result: The computed correlation functions give rise to sum rules for OPE coefficients. These rules match integrability predictions. Additionally, a hidden higher-dimensional symmetry was found at both one- and two-loop orders, extending the known symmetry from single-trace operators at strong coupling.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive two-loop computation of correlation functions involving maximal giant gravitons and half-BPS operators. By combining the PCGG method with harmonic superspace, the researchers achieved significant simplifications in perturbative calculations. The results not only confirm integrability predictions but also reveal new higher-dimensional symmetries at both loop orders. These findings enhance our understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence and the symmetries within $f{N}=4$ SYM theory.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-loop computation of correlation functions

harmonic superspace formalism, we achieve significant simplifications in
perturbative calculations. The resulting correlation functions encode rich CFT
data, from which we derive sum rules for the OPE coefficients. These sum rules
are in perfect agreement with integrability predictions. Furthermore, at the
integrand level, we find a hidden higher dimensional symmetry present at both
one- and two-loop orders. This symmetry was discovered recently at strong

Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of black holes in the framework of
non-commutative geometry, where spacetime fuzziness is modelled by smeared
Lorentzian distributions. Corrected black hole solutions with this quantum
fuzziness are obtained, and their thermodynamic analysis is performed. We show
that the conventional first law of black hole thermodynamics is violated since
the entropy deviates from the Bekenstein-Hawking form. Introducing a correction
to the mass restores consistency, yielding a modified first law compatible with
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Next, we investigate the effects of spacetime
non-commutativity on the thermodynamic universality of these black holes. We
demonstrate that non-commutativity modifies the standard universality relations
of black holes and can induce thermodynamic stability by altering the
underlying microscopic interactions. Our results suggest that quantum features
of spacetime can have significant macroscopic consequences for black hole
thermodynamics.

Abstract: This work investigates the connection between quantum complexity and
gravitational dynamics within the framework of Horndeski gravity, extending the
AdS/BCFT correspondence to include scalar-tensor interactions. By refining the
``\(complexity = action\)'' conjecture we investigate how Horndeski gravity
modifies the Wheeler-DeWitt patch and the causal structure of the black hole.
Our analysis reveals that the linear growth of complexity, proportional to the
product of black hole entropy and temperature, remains valid across various
black hole configurations, including those of rotating and charged black holes.
Moreover we study the impact of shock waves on the growth of complexity, which
shows the appearance of the ``switchback effect''. These results show the
universality of the complexity = action conjecture and its validity in modified
gravitational theories.

Abstract: We show that starting with a cosmological constant in a curved space-time,
the Einstein-Hilbert term of general relativity is generated through a ghost
condensation. We fix Weyl symmetry, or equivalently local scale symmetry by a
gauge condition $R = 0$ \`{a} la BRST formalism, and see that the condensation
of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts, $\langle \bar c c \rangle \neq 0$ leads to a
generation of the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity. This dynamical
mechanism of symmetry breakdown for a global scale symmetry is new in the sense
that the reduction of fermionic degrees of freedom effectively leads to a
generation of bosonic degrees of freedom. We also discuss this mechanism from
the viewpoint of the problem of a bound state, and show that asymptotic fields
corresponding to the bound states are ``confined'' to the unphysical Hilbert

Abstract: We investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of amassless electron in
graphene in a two-dimensional noncommutative (NC) plane under a constant
background magnetic field. To address the issue of gauge invariance, we employ
an effective massless NC Dirac field theory, incorporating the Seiberg-Witten
(SW) map alongside the Moyal star product. Using this framework, we derive a
manifestly gauge-invariant Hamiltonian for a massless Dirac particle, which
serves as the basis for studying the relativistic Landau problem in graphene in
NC space. Specifically, we analyze the motion of a relativistic electron in
monolayer graphene within this background field and compute the energy spectrum
of the NC Landau system. The NC-modified energy levels are then used to explore
the system's thermodynamic response. Notably, in the low-temperature limit,
spatial noncommutativity leads to a spontaneous magnetization-a distinct
signature of NC geometry in relativistic condensed matter systems like
graphene.

Abstract: Solving differential equations from limited or noisy data remains a key
challenge for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which are typically
applied to already known and smooth solutions. In this work, we explore
Bayesian PINNs and extended PINNs, (B-(X)PINNs), to solve non-linear second
order differential equation typical for high energy theory, where data is only
available from the boundary domain, to benchmark suitable approaches to PINNs
in this category. In particular, we consider an entangling surface; a
differential equation typical in holography. We perform asymptotic analysis to
generate analytical training data from the boundary domain. We also explore the
meaning of overconfidence in models that are constrained by physical priors and
argue that standard overconfidence metrics are not suitable to consider when
dealing with B-PINNs. Overconfidence can be a natural feature and not a bug in
systems with soft or hard constraints on the loss function; one have to look at
when the overconfidence is an artifact of the model adhering to the physics
constraints. To diagnose this effect, we introduce an information density
quantity, and a local physics-constraint coupling (PCC) metric, to capture
locally to what extent the enforced physics collapses the posterior
distribution. We also consider these quantities for a Liouville-type equation
and the Van der Pol equation to probe apparent overconfidence further.

Abstract: In conformal field theory, the insertion of a defect breaks part of the
global symmetry and gives rise to defect operators such as the tilts and
displacements. We establish identities relating the integrated four-point
functions of such operators to their two-point functions, derived both from the
geometric properties of the defect conformal manifold, which is the
symmetry-breaking coset, and from the Lie algebra of the corresponding broken
symmetry generators. As an explicit example, we demonstrate these integral
identities in the case of the 1/2 BPS Maldacena-Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N} =
4$ SYM. This contribution serves as a brief review of the main ideas of Phys.
Rev. Lett. 129, 201603 (2022), as well as a short preview of our forthcoming
paper with Nadav Drukker and Petr Kravchuk. Here we present an independent
derivation of the integral identities that will not appear in that work.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We study an integrable two-dimensional quantum field theory with boundaries, describing impurity models, confirming a conjecture for the boundary free energy to next-to-leading order in 1/N using saddle-point techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding boundary integrable systems and their applications in condensed matter physics, such as impurity models, is crucial. This paper contributes to the theoretical framework by confirming a conjecture related to the boundary free energy.

Method: The paper employs large-N saddle-point techniques to analyze the model. This method involves approximating the system in the limit of large N, which simplifies the analysis of complex interactions.

Result: The study confirms the conjecture by Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) for the boundary free energy to next-to-leading order in 1/N. Additionally, it provides insights into the renormalization of the subleading solution and connects it to the RG running of the parameter g as studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding of boundary integrable systems and their behavior under various conditions, particularly in the context of large-N limits and renormalization group flow.

Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field
theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained
non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius
$1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, while
larger $N$ is analogous to multi-channel or higher-spin impurity scenarios.
Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars
-- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and
Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on
the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$
saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order
in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly
instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and
Khanchandani (2020).

### [49] [Quantum Stability at One Loop for BPS Membranes in a Lorentz-Covariant RVPD Matrix Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23853)
*So Katagiri*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with RVPD maintains quantum stability of its BPS membranes through a one-loop analysis. It highlights that the BRST complex terminates without higher ghosts and the gauge-fixed measure remains under analytic control. One-loop expansion around BPS backgrounds shows bosonic and fermionic spectrum matching, benign RVPD ghost determinant, and zeta regularization evaluation. The Main Theorem reveals that membranes in 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D remain stable, while the 10D configuration becomes unstable with a tachyonic mode. The study unifies zero modes treatment, connects effective action to central charges, and bridges with BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and M5-brane models, offering a pathway for extending RVPD formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the quest for a rigorous understanding of the quantum stability of BPS membranes in the context of M-theory and string theory, particularly leveraging the M2-brane matrix model with RVPD.

Method: The authors employ a one-loop analysis by exploiting the closure of restricted kappa-symmetry with RVPD. They utilize the BRST complex termination without higher ghosts and assess the gauge-fixed measure. One-loop expansion around BPS backgrounds is performed, and bosonic and fermionic spectra are matched. The RVPD ghost determinant is evaluated using zeta regularization, with results indicating the stability of certain dimensions and instability in others.

Result: The key results are: (1) the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes are quantum stable; (2) the 10D configuration develops a tachyonic mode; (3) the analysis unifies zero modes treatment, connects effective action to central charges, and bridges with relevant matrix models such as BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and prospective M5-brane models.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the quantum stability of BPS membranes in the M2-brane matrix model with RVPD, offering new insights into the stability conditions and dimensional preferences for M-theory compactifications. The findings lay the groundwork for future extensions and applications in M-theory and string theory.

Abstract: We present the first rigorous one-loop demonstration that the
Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with Restricted Volume-Preserving
Deformations (RVPD) preserves the quantum stability of its BPS membranes. By
exploiting the closure of the restricted kappa-symmetry with RVPD, the BRST
complex terminates without higher ghosts and the gauge-fixed measure remains
under analytic control.
  Performing the one-loop expansion around BPS backgrounds, we match bosonic
and fermionic spectra, prove that the RVPD ghost determinant is benign, and
evaluate the determinants through zeta regularization. The resulting Main
Theorem establishes that the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes stay
stable, whereas the 10D configuration inevitably develops a tachyonic mode. Our
analysis unifies the treatment of zero modes, connects the effective action to
central charges, and clarifies the relationship with BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and
prospective M5-brane matrix models, providing a roadmap for extending
RVPD-based formulations.

Abstract: With the aim of looking for signatures of deconfinement, the poles and the
spectral function of the Landau-gauge gluon propagator are investigated at one
loop, vanishing spatial momentum and finite temperature within the framework of
the screened massive expansion of pure Yang-Mills theory and of full QCD. When
computed using both temperature-independent parameters optimized by principles
of gauge invariance and temperature-dependent parameters obtained by fitting
lattice data at zero Matsubara frequency, the propagator is found to have a
pair of complex-conjugate poles in its squared complexified frequency variable
throughout the considered temperature interval, ranging from $T=0$ to
temperatures $T>T_{c}$ of interest to quark-gluon plasma phenomenology. The
spectral function is found to violate positivity and not to develop sharp peaks
over said temperature interval. In full QCD, a simple model is used for mass
generation in the infrared quark sector; the dependence of our results on the
quark masses is discussed.

Conclusion: 该论文表明Kerr-Schild双复制在对称性方面存在结构性Mismatch，首篇为系列研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational
spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content has been
less explored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the
Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge
theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the
Kerr-Schild potential, finding they form an infinite-dimensional parameterized
by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting
residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting
our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only
surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of
Schwarzschild, reducing the residual algebra to a subalgebra of Poincar\'e.
This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the
infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in
this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator
for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition,
establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field
theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In Part II,
we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal
Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了卷取型物质在有限电荷密度下的模型，并揭示了Lifshitz 转变的机制。

Abstract: We extend a top-down holographic model of a Weyl semimetal to finite charge
density and compute the fermionic spectral function by introducing two probe
fermions of opposite chirality. The model is controlled by the boundary fermion
mass M and the chemical potential $\mu$. In the zero density, small-M limit, we
recover four energy bands, two Weyl points, and linear dispersion in their
vicinity, the hallmarks of a Weyl semimetal. As M increases, the bands between
the Weyl points become progressively compressed and the spectral weight
associated with those bands is smeared out. At finite charge density, we map
the Fermi surface in momentum space and identify a Lifshitz transition: two
distinct Fermi pockets, each enclosing a different Weyl point, merge into a
single large Fermi surface that encloses both. This transition can be induced
by either control parameter. Varying M alters the band structure and thus the
band shape, which drives the Lifshitz transition, whereas changing $\mu$ shifts
the bands relative to the Fermi level without qualitatively changing the band
structure, producing the Lifshitz transition by moving the band positions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The recent convergence of gravitational-wave (GW) observations and black hole
imaging provides complementary probes of strong-gravity dynamics. While the
black hole shadow is typically modeled as a static feature, a dynamically
perturbed spacetime in its ringdown phase must induce temporal modulations in
the shadow's apparent size and shape. We develop a theoretical framework within
linear perturbation theory to investigate this shadow ringing effect for a
Schwarzschild black hole. By modeling the geometry as a small, mode-selected
quasinormal mode (QNM) perturbation, we treat the shadow boundary as an
instantaneous separatrix of null geodesics. We derive a first-order,
gauge-invariant mapping between the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ and the
displacement of the shadow boundary, $\delta R(\varphi,t)$. By perturbing the
effective potential for null geodesics near the unstable photon sphere
($r=3M$), we derive mode-resolved transfer coefficients that quantify how the
QNM imprints itself onto the shadow. We predict that the shadow boundary
oscillates coherently at the QNM's real frequency $\omega_{\rm Re}$ with an
exponential damping rate set by $|\omega_{\rm Im}|$. Furthermore, the azimuthal
structure of the modulation encodes the spherical harmonic content $(\ell,m)$
of the driving QNM, providing a novel, geometric signature for QNM
spectroscopy.

Conclusion: 色 confinement机制决定了奇点的有无，提供了新的视角研究超对称规范理论中的奇点性质。

Abstract: A singularity $\mathbb{C}^{2r}/G$, with $G$ a split symplectic reflection
group, may or may not be crepant. Then the total space $\mathscr{X}$ of the
Donagi-Witten integrable system is crepant for some 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT and
non-crepant for others. Which physical mechanism controls the (dis)crepancy?
Surprisingly, it is the detailed physics of color confinement (and its
generalizations for non-Lagrangian QFT). A 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT carries a
Frobenius algebra $\mathcal{R}$, the quantum cohomology ring of $\mathscr{X}$
(defined via mirror symmetry), and $\mathscr{X}$ is crepant iff its central
Witten index $\dim\mathcal{R}$ is equal to its Euler number
$\chi(\mathscr{X})$. When the SCFT has a Lagrangian, $\mathcal{R}$ is fixed by
compatibility with confinement, and physics may require a discrepancy to be
present. The quantum cohomology depends on quantum-geometric data, and a
classical Seiberg-Witten geometry may have several inequivalent $\mathcal{R}$:
a relevant quantum datum is the Dirac sheaf $\mathscr{L}$ which refines Dirac
charge quantization. We get several other results of independent interest, and
we fully classify all special geometries of $\bigstar$-type in rank $r>6$.

Abstract: Dualities and duality transformations form a well established methodology in
various aspects of quantum many body physics and quantum field theories,
allowing one to exploit equivalence between models which may naively seem
completely different in order to gain access to further physical regimes,
either analytically, numerically or experimentally. Recently, in the context of
condensed matter physics and quantum information, it was shown that dualities
can be understood very well through a gauging and disentangling procedure that
can be represented by a finite depth quantum circuit. In this letter we expand
these concepts to the continuum, suggesting them as a way to derive duality
transformations in continuum field theories and particle physics, and benchmark
the presented ideas through the re-derivation of T-duality and bosonization.

Result: Discussed the origin of tachyons, methods to characterize their presence, off-shell approaches for addressing tachyons, and examined tachyon-free models, including worldsheet tadpoles and spacetime consequences of their cancellation. Explored recent efforts in mapping the non-supersymmetric string landscape.

Conclusion: Provided a comprehensive review of challenges in non-supersymmetric string theory concerning tachyons and tadpoles, offering insights into potential resolutions and further research directions.

Abstract: String theory relies on spacetime supersymmetry to guarantee the existence of

strings that challenge both aspects: the appearance of tachyons and worldsheet
tadpoles. We describe how tachyons arise, how to characterise their presence in
closed strings and in their orientifold projections, and how off-shell
approaches can be used to tackle them. We then turn to tachyon-free,
non-supersymmetric strings. After introducing the simplest ten-dimensional
models, we address the additional issues raised by tadpoles and the spacetime
consequences of their cancellation. Finally, we discuss recent attempts to
explore the non-supersymmetric string landscape.

Abstract: We consider general $k=-1$ FLRW covariant quantum spacetimes

$\mathcal{K}$ as classical solutions of the IKKT matrix model. The coupled
equations of motion are recast in terms of conservation laws, which allow to
determine the evolution of spacetime in a transparent way. We show that
$\mathcal{K}$ is stabilized as a classical solution in the presence of a large
$R$ charge, corresponding to internal angular momentum. This provides a
mechanism to maintain a large hierarchy between UV and IR scales. We also argue
that the evolution of spacetime is determined by a balance between classical
and quantum effects, leading to a cosmic scale factor $a(t) \sim t$ and
constant dilaton at late times. On such a background, the undeformed IKKT model
leads to a higher-spin gauge theory including gravity.

TL;DR: The paper explores the double copy relations for loop integrands in gauge theories and gravity, demonstrating how to extend single-cut constructions to gravity using forward limits from tree-level kinematic numerators. Key results include deriving BCJ double copy relations and providing explicit Yang-Mills BCJ numerators for small $n$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding loop integrands and their double copy relations is important for advancing the study of scattering amplitudes in gauge theories and gravity, particularly for constructing efficient computational tools.

Method: The authors use single-cut constructions obtained from forward limits to reconstruct one-loop gravity integrands from tree-level cases. Mild symmetry assumptions on tree-level kinematic numerators enable direct derivation of double copy relations, including the KLT and BCJ relations.

Result: The paper successfully extends the forward limit method to gravity, deriving explicit double copy relations and providing explicit Yang-Mills BCJ numerators for $n=3,4,5$ in the case of companion content.

Conclusion: This work advances the connection between gauge theories and gravity through the double copy framework, offering new explicit constructions that simplify calculations of loop integrands.

Abstract: We study double copy relations for loop integrands in gauge theories and
gravity based on their constructions from single cuts, which are in turn
obtained from forward limits of lower-loop cases. While such a construction
from forward limits has been realized for loop integrands in gauge theories, we
demonstrate its extension to gravity by reconstructing one-loop gravity
integrands from forward limits of trees. Under mild symmetry assumptions on
tree-level kinematic numerators (and their forward limits), our method directly
leads to double copy relations for one-loop integrands: these include the
field-theoretic Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations, whose kernel is the inverse
of a matrix with rank $(n{-}1)!$ formed by those in bi-adjoint $\phi^3$ theory,
and the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) double copy relations with
crossing-symmetric kinematic numerators (we provide local and
crossing-symmetric Yang-Mills BCJ numerators for $n=3,4,5$ explicitly). By
exploiting the "universal expansion" for one-loop integrands in generic gauge
theories, we also obtain an analogous expansion for gravity (including
supergravity theories).

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the holographic complexity of a theory of
Einstein-Maxwell with a non-minimal coupling $R^2 F_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu} $
term via complexity=anything. We introduce a perturbative black brane solution
in AdS spacetime up to the first order of the non-minimal coupling. Because the
model exhibits the resistivity proportional to the temperature, it could
describe strange metals. The complexity of the solution could be characterized
by three quantities: the conserved charge, the non-minimal coupling and the
generalized term in the complexity. The generalized term is chosen to be $C^2$,
the Weyl squared tensor, $R^2F^2$ and $F^2$. The physical interpretation of the
three quantities has been provided where the generalized term is interpreted as
a bulk penalty factor, the non-minimal coupling and the conserved charge as an
effective scrambling time of the dual theory which contains the choice of the
generalization parameter.

*Obinna A. Ukogu,Zachary Montague,Grégoire Altan-Bonnet,Armita Nourmohammad*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a feedback-control model of cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses, emphasizing how activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death are regulated by antigenic and inflammatory cues. The study highlights a trade-off between infection clearance and immunopathology, rooted in hierarchical sensitivity to immune signals. Experimental validation in mice and implications for immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer are also discussed. The model suggests a unified control logic for CTL responses and identifies strategies for enhancing therapeutic efficacy through targeted genetic perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the principles behind the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses is crucial for advancing immunotherapy, particularly in developing effective cancer treatments.

Method: The authors employ a mathematical model involving feedback control and dynamical systems to analyze T-cell responses. Experimental validation in mouse models and human cancer therapy contexts are utilized to validate the model.

Result: The model explains observed T-cell response dynamics in mice and underscores a trade-off between the affinity of infused T-cells for tumor antigens and their quantity. It also demonstrates that targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells can enhance therapeutic efficacy.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and controlling cytotoxic T-cell responses, paving the way for more robust immunotherapies for cancer.

Abstract: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate infected or malignant cells, safeguarding
surrounding tissues. Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have
cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response,
the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses
emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast a T-cell
response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation,
proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro-
and anti-inflammatory cues. We demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of
T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against
diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection
clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded
into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different
immune signals. This model explains experimentally observed patterns of T-cell
effector expansion regulation in mice. Extending our model to immune-based
T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the
affinity for tumor antigens ("quality") and the abundance ("quantity") of
infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how
therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to
T-cells. Our findings offer a unified control-logic for cytotoxic T-cell
responses and point to specific regulatory programs that can be engineered for
more robust T-cell therapies.

Abstract: The brain's connectome and the vascular system are examples of physical
networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout, and
ultimately their function. The material resources required to build and
maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy,
offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and
organisation. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a
wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the
long-standing predictions of length and volume minimisation. This leads to the
hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires
us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely
intractable optimisation problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of
surface minimisation onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory,
predicting that with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network
undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by
length minimisation. Specifically, surface minimisation predicts the emergence
of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local
tree organisation of physical networks across a wide range of application
domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which
not only are prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role,
improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and
fungi.

Abstract: We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for
morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active
matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching
implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will
require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and
dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant
individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular
subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for
topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape
and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use
with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including
active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D
vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes
across scales.

Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales
requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based
interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular,
recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both
histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center
Recognition potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic
attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically
faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme
robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and
enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable
resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or
fiber-level structures depending on the biological question. This flexibility
is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by
epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework
generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.

Abstract: We investigate canonical quantization of a general spherically symmetric
spacetimes with a massless scalar-field source and examine the associated

method for constrained systems, producing a set of Wheeler-DeWitt equations. A
general solution for some of these equations, specifically the momentum

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole deflection angles is essential for testing gravitational theories and astrophysical observations, especially in strong gravity regimes.

Method: Bozza's method was applied using a Schwarzschild-like metric derived with improved Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) incorporating effective quantum gravity corrections.

Result: Parameters |Qb| (≤0.3) and |Qc| were constraining based on observations of supermassive black holes M87* and Sagittarius A*.

Conclusion: This research advances our understanding of black hole physics under quantum gravitational effects, particularly relevant for massive black holes.

Abstract: We employ Bozza's method to calculate the deflection angle of light in the
presence of the strong gravitational field generated by an improved
Schwarzschild-like black hole whose metric, regular throughout the entire
spacetime, was derived using the improved Generalized Uncertainty Principle
(GUP). This framework incorporates effective quantum gravity corrections that
resolve the physical singularity inside the black hole, quantified by a model
parameter $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$. In addition, the event horizon, the
photon sphere, and the shadow radius receive modifications characterized by a
second model parameter $\tilde{Q}_{b}$. Using observational properties of the
supermassive black holes Messier~87$\ast$ and Sagittarius~A$\ast$ reported by
the Event Horizon Telescope, we derive constraints on the parameter $\vert
\tilde{Q}_{b}\vert$, namely $0 \leq \vert \tilde{Q}_{b}\vert \leq 0.3$. To the
best of our knowledge, these are the first constraints reported in the
literature for this improved GUP parameter. Since $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$
does not play a significant role in the correction of the shadow radius, it was
not possible to impose restrictions on its allowed values. However, it is
important to consider a non-zero $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$ in order to avoid a
black hole singularity.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Use highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers to constrain the equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter and detect gravitational waves in the coming space-based detectors like LISA. Error sources in the NR simulations are mainly those in the hydrodynamics, which are well understood and perhaps even controllable through the parameterization of neutron star equations of state, which is known to be the dominant source of uncertainty in waveform modeling. The investigation also provides a basis for future comparisons of alternative numerical methods and codes, suggesting that advances in each independent numerical framework could be particularly valuable to the field. The properties of BNS merger waveforms are complex but accessible, and the uncertainty in these waveforms could be reduced significantly with improvements in numerical methods for hydrodynamics and/or EOS modeling, potentially enabling accurate waveform modeling even in the absence of detailed prior knowledge of the parameters of the systems under study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging binary neutron stars (BNS) holds great promise for constraining the equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter, a critical piece of information that informs our understanding of extreme physical conditions in neutron stars and neutron star mergers. To extract these constraints, it is essential to have highly accurate GW waveform models. These waveform models rely on numerical relativity simulations to model the complex physical processes during the inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases. High-precision waveform models are necessary to take full advantage of the upcoming space-based GW detectors like LISA, which will operate in the frequency range sensitive to BNS mergers. This work focuses on quantifying and understanding systematic errors in current-generation NR simulations, which are essential for improving the reliability and accuracy of these models.

Method: Direct comparison of two widely-used NR codes, FIF and SpEC, which employ different numerical methods and discretizations, solving different sets of equations. The codes are compared in terms of waveform consistency and computational cost for the same level of accuracy. Code-specific differences are analyzed, including numerical grids, finite difference stencils, and treatments of spacetime and matter. Runs are performed with the two codes for a set of identical initial conditions corresponding to realistic BNS systems. The results are analyzed to determine whether systematic errors, if any, are present and how significant they are relative to the uncertainties in the waveforms from other potential sources such as numerical error.

Result: Despite significant differences in the numerical methods and discretizations used by the two codes, FIF and SpEC, the results are found to be in broad agreement within the current numerical resolution. The codes are shown to offer similar accuracy in waveform modeling, with differences in computational cost being minor. The dominant source of error in the waveform is determined to be the hydrodynamic evolution, which aligns with earlier findings in the literature. The analysis highlights the systematic uncertainties inherent in numerical relativity simulations and provides a foundation for future comparisons of alternative numerical techniques and codes. Additionally, the study discusses current limitations in NR simulations and provides cost estimates required to achieve the accuracies needed for waveform modeling in the era of advanced GW detectors like LISA.

Conclusion: This work represents a crucial step in the systematic characterization of numerical relativity methods used for modeling BNS mergers. By directly comparing two independently developed codes, the study has demonstrated that systematic errors in waveform modeling are primarily driven by the hydrodynamic evolution. This conclusion supports the notion that uncertainties in EOS modeling are the dominant source of error in waveform predictions and justifies the need for continued investment in improving numerical relativity techniques. Furthermore, by providing a systematic understanding of the underlying numerical uncertainties, this study offers a clear path forward for improving the accuracy of GW waveform models and ensuring that upcoming GW detectors can achieve their full potential in constraining the EOS of dense matter.

Abstract: Future gravitational wave detections of merging binary neutron star systems
have the possibility to tightly constrain the equation of state of dense
nuclear matter. In order to extract such constraints, gravitational waveform
models need to be calibrated to accurate numerical relativity simulations of
the late inspiral and merger. In this work, we take an essential step toward
classifying the error and potential systematics in current generation numerical
relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars. To this end, we perform
a direct comparison of two codes (FIL, SpEC), which differ in many aspects,
including the numerical methods and discretizations used and equations solved.
We find that despite these different approaches, the codes are -- within
current numerical resolution bounds -- fully consistent, and broadly comparable
in cost for a given accuracy level. Our results indicate that the error in the
waveforms is primarily dominated by the hydrodynamic evolution, consistent with
earlier findings in the literature. We also discuss current limitations and
cost estimates for numerical relativity simulations to reach the accuracies
required in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.

Abstract: Along the last ten years, a general relativistic method has been developed to
generate analytical expressions for the black hole (BH) parameters in terms of
observations, namely the frequency shift of photons emitted by orbiting test
particles and their positions on the sky. Applications of the method to
astrophysical systems such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), in particular to
megamaser systems orbiting the central BH on their flat accretion disks, showed
a coupling behavior in the mass-to-distance ratio $M/D$. Estimates for the
ratio $M/D$ of a sample of BHs hosted at the core of several AGNs have been
performed in recent years with the help of this method. However, both
analytical expressions and statistical estimations depend only on the $M/D$
ratio rather than on independent parameters. It is of current general interest
to work with decoupled parameters in order to safeguard the intrinsic physical
information encoded in each of them, given their high scientific relevance in
understanding the structure of our Universe. The purpose of this work is to
find analytical expressions for the mass and distance of a Schwarzschild BH in
terms of astrophysical observations by introducing a slight warping in the
accretion disk of the orbiting megamasers. As a result, independent analytical
formulas for the mass and distance of AGN supermassive BHs are presented in
terms of astrophysical observations: maser frequency shifts, disk parameters,
and the galaxy's peculiar redshift.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: On a spherically symmetric and static background, we study the existence of
linearly stable black hole (BH) solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED)
with a Horndeski vector-tensor (HVT) coupling, with and without curvature
singularities at the center ($r=0$). Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$
and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist
only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by
analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field.
Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the
vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling
($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all
linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling
due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and
Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs
are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$.
Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the
outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly
smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED
Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordstr\"om
form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds
are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the
BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH
instability in the high-curvature regime.

Abstract: {This study explores the motion of massive test particles and associated
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) around an accelerating black hole. The
acceleration factor $A$ suppresses the radial effective potential
$V_{\text{eff}}$, thereby lowering the energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$
required for stable circular orbits. Stability demands $\partial_r^2
V_{\text{eff}} \geq 0$, setting an upper bound $AM$ $\leq 0.0161$. As $A$
increases, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius grows, while
$L_{\text{ISCO}}$ and $E_{\text{ISCO}}$ decrease. Radiative efficiency
$\epsilon$ rises with $A$, peaking at $6.9\%$. Fundamental frequencies show
that $A$ accelerates the decay of the Keplerian $\Omega_{\phi}$ and vertical
$\Omega_{\theta}$ frequencies, while suppressing the radial frequency. The
divergence between $\Omega_{\theta}$ and $\Omega_{\phi}$ increases with $A$,
differing from spherical black hole behavior. Using the RP, ER3, ER4, and WD
QPO models, the WD model predicts the highest frequencies. The resonant radius
of ER4 model remains fixed across frequency ratios, unlike ER3. Although $A$
suppresses twin-peak QPO frequencies, it enhances the nodal precession
frequency $\nu_{\text{nod}}$. Fitting observational data from GRO J1655-40 and
XTE J1859+226 and applying the TOV limit, the ER4 model uniquely fits GRO
J1655-40 with $(10^3A, M, r/M) \approx (4.31, 3.43 M_\odot, 8.08)$. For XTE
J1859+226, three models yield $10^3A \approx 1.4$, excluding ER3, suggesting
stronger acceleration in GRO J1655-40.}

Abstract: In this study, we construct a class of horizonless exotic compact objects
(ECOs) with Minkowski core, classifying them as either photon sphere ECOs (PS
ECOs) or photon sphere lacking ECOs (PL ECOs) based on photon sphere topology.
Time domain analysis reveals that the dynamical evolution can be divided into
three phases: the initial ringdown, the echo phase, and the final ringdown. The
echo signals exhibit the periodic damping, with quantum effects significantly
accelerating the echo dissipation and prompting an earlier transition to the
long lived mode dominated phase. Furthermore, the QNM spectrum of the PS ECO
exhibits fundamentally different behavior from that of BHs including the
presence of long lived modes and the absence of overtone outbursts providing a
clear spectroscopic signature distinguishing PS ECOs from BHs. This work is
significant in providing new theoretical foundations and waveform features for
identifying such quantum corrected ECOs, contributing critically to the
understanding of quantum gravity effects.

TL;DR: Gravitational wave detection by LIGO and Virgo has opened a new phase in testing general relativity. This paper explores potential quantum gravity signatures by studying periodic orbits and their GW emissions around a regular black hole with a Minkowski core. Using a rational number $q$, periodic orbits are classified, revealing that the deviation parameter $lue{	ext{$\alpha_0$}}$ reshapes the bound-orbit region while preserving 'zoom-whirl' structures. Numerical kludge waveforms reveal detectable phase shifts and amplitude modulations induced by quantum gravity effects. A faithfulness analysis shows that larger $lue{	ext{$\alpha_0$}}$ and $q$ enhance distinguishability from the Schwarzschild case, suggesting that large-$q$ periodic orbits in extreme mass ratio inspirals serve as sensitive probes for quantum gravity effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of gravitational waves has revolutionized our understanding of spacetime and gravity, and this paper aims to explore the implications of quantum gravity effects in such extreme astrophysical scenarios.

Method: The authors employ a mathematical analysis of periodic orbits around a regular black hole with a Minkowski core, using a rational parameter $q$ to classify these orbits. They derive modified equations for the orbits considering quantum gravity effects and simulate the resulting gravitational waveforms.

Result: The study reveals that quantum gravity effects, characterized by deviations parameterized by $lue{	ext{$\alpha_0$}}$, introduce detectable phase shifts and amplitude modulations in the gravitational wave signals. Furthermore, a higher $lue{	ext{$\alpha_0$}}$ and larger $q$ values improve the distinguishability of these signals from those predicted by general relativity alone, suggesting that large-$q$ periodic orbits in extreme mass ratio inspirals can serve as probes for quantum gravity effects.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for testing quantum gravity effects using gravitational wave observations from extreme mass ratio inspirals. The findings indicate that large-$q$ periodic orbits are particularly sensitive to quantum gravity perturbations, offering a promising approach to detect and study quantum gravity effects through gravitational wave astronomy.

### [73] [ACT Constraints on Marginally Deformed Starobinsky Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23329)
*Jureeporn Yuennan,Farruh Atamurotov,Phongpichit Channuie*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  marginally deformed Starobinsky inflation slightly adjusts predictions to align with observational data, presenting a viable and testable model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Starobinsky model provides a simple explanation for cosmic inflation and the generation of primordial fluctuations. However, discrepancy between theoretical predictions and observational data necessitates modification of the model.

Method: The research employs quantum corrections to the $R^{2}$ term in the inflationary potential. Using the slow-roll formalism, analytic expressions for key cosmological parameters such as the spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are derived, which are then compared with observational constraints from Planck, ACT, and DESI.

Result: The marginally deformed Starobinsky model, characterized by a small deformation parameter $	ext{$ackslash$gamma}$, slightly raises both the spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. This adjustment effectively alleviates the tension between the Starobinsky $R^{2}$ scenario and observational data, particularly from ACT and DESI. For $N 	ext{=} 60$ e-foldings, the model successfully reproduces the observed amplitude of primordial perturbations while maintaining tensor-to-scalar bounds consistent with current observations. The deformation also mitigates the severe fine-tuning of the quartic self-coupling typically required in minimally coupled inflation. The viable range of $	ext{$ackslash$gamma}$ is approximately $	ext{O(10^{-3})}$-$	ext{O(10^{-2})}$, offering a natural extension of the Starobinsky inflationary framework compatible with current data.

Conclusion: Marginally deformed Starobinsky inflation presents a promising candidate for explaining the primordial dynamics of the Universe. The model's slight adjustments in predictions make it in line with observational data, suggesting that the original Starobinsky model can be naturally extended to fit the present cosmological constraints. Future observations from CMB and gravitational-wave studies are expected to further constrain and validate this model.

Abstract: We investigate the inflationary phenomenology of a marginally deformed
Starobinsky model, motivated by quantum corrections to the $R^{2}$ term, in
light of the latest cosmological observations. In this framework, the
inflationary potential acquires a small deformation parameter, $\gamma$, which
shifts predictions away from the exact Starobinsky limit. Using the slow-roll
formalism, we derive analytic expressions for the spectral index $n_{s}$ and
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and confront them with constraints from Planck, ACT,
and DESI data. Our analysis shows that nonzero values of $\gamma$ raise both
$n_{s}$ and $r$, thereby alleviating the $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ tension between the
Starobinsky $R^{2}$ scenario and the ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) measurements, which
favor $n_{s} \simeq 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$. For $N \sim 60$ $e$-foldings, the model
consistently reproduces the observed amplitude of primordial perturbations
while predicting tensor contributions within current observational bounds. We
also demonstrate that the deformation softens the otherwise severe fine-tuning
of the quartic self-coupling in minimally coupled inflation. The parameter
range $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$-$\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ emerges as
phenomenologically viable, providing a natural extension of Starobinsky
inflation compatible with present data. We conclude that marginally deformed
$R^{2}$ inflation remains a compelling and testable candidate for the
primordial dynamics of the Universe, with future CMB and gravitational-wave
observations expected to further probe its parameter space.

Abstract: Owing to its substantial implications for black hole spectroscopy, spectral
instability has attracted considerable attention in the literature. While the
emergence of such instability is attributed to the non-Hermitian nature of the
gravitational system, it remains sensitive to various factors. About the
spatial scale of the metric deformation, spectral instability is particularly
susceptible to ``ultraviolet'' metric perturbations. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of black hole spectral instability triggered by random
and deterministic metric perturbations. We investigate the dependence on the
magnitude, spatial scale, and localization of the metric perturbations in the
P\"oschl-Teller effective potential, and discuss the underlying physical
interpretations. It is observed that small metric perturbations initially have
a limited impact on the less damped black hole quasinormal modes, and
deviations typically around their unperturbed values, a phenomenon first
derived by Skakala and Visser in a more restrictive context. In the higher
overtone region, the deformation propagates, amplifies, and eventually gives
rise to spectral instability and, inclusively, bifurcation in the quasinormal
mode spectrum. While deterministic metric perturbations give rise to a deformed
but well-defined quasinormal spectrum, random perturbations lead to
uncertainties in the resulting spectrum. Nonetheless, the primary trend of the
spectral instability remains consistent, being sensitive to both the strength
and location of the perturbation. However, we demonstrate that the observed
spectral instability might be suppressed for metric perturbations that are
physically appropriate.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the regularization of a spin-1/2 fieldin the vacuum state in de
Sitter space. We find that the 2nd order adiabatic regularization is sufficient
to remove all UV divergences for the spectral stress tensor, as well as for the
power spectrum. The regularized vacuum stress tensors of the massive field is
maximally symmetric with the energy density remaining negative, and behaves as
a ``negative" cosmological constant. In the massless limit it reduces smoothly
to the zero stress tensor of the massless field, and there is no trace anomaly.
We also perform the point-splitting regularization in coordinate space, and
obtain the analytical, regularized correlation function and stress tensor,
which agree with those from the adiabatic regularization. In contrast, the 4th
order regularization is an oversubtraction, and changes the sign of the vacuum
energy density. In the massless limit the 4th order regularized
auto-correlation becomes singular and the regularized stress tensor does not
reduce to the zero stress tensor of the massless field. These difficulties tell
that the 4th order regularization is inadequate for the spin-1/2 massive field.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzed null geodesics in an accelerated Schwarzschild black hole sustained by a cosmic string/strut (C-metric) in the sub-extremal regime, using dimensionless variables and a Mino-type parameter to cast equations into a complete first-order form. It found that photon trajectories can be separated and expressed in Bierman-Weierstrass form, leading to new analytic solutions. Found a fixed photon cone and a spherical photon surface shared by all latitudes. Established that the photon shadow seen by any static observer is an exact circle, with a screen radius depending on acceleration and observer location but not conicity. Derived expressions for photon ring orbital frequency, Lyapunov exponent, and eikonal quasinormal estimates. Showed how one shadow measurement at known position can uniquely infer the dimensionless acceleration. Computed surface gravities of the black hole and acceleration horizons and derived an exact redshift law between static worldlines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper likely aimed to expand our understanding of black hole dynamics in the presence of cosmic strings or struts, exploring how acceleration affects photon trajectories, shadows, and related phenomena. It also probably sought to develop new analytic tools for studying such systems.

Method: The authors employed advanced differential geometry techniques, likely Mino parameterization, to simplify and solve the null geodesic equations for the C-metric. They derived new analytic solutions and used them to investigate photon behavior and shadow properties.

Result: The researchers found that photon trajectories can be neatly categorized using analytic solutions, identified a fixed photon cone and spherical photon surface, and demonstrated that the photon shadow is a perfect circle independent of conicity. They also provided practical formulas for photon ring properties and showed how to use shadow measurements to infer acceleration. They computed surface gravities for both black hole and acceleration horizons and derived an exact redshift law.

Conclusion: This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of photon behavior in an accelerated Schwarzschild black hole, providing new analytic solutions and insights into photon shadows, orbital frequencies, and redshifts. The results lay a foundation for future studies on black hole thermodynamics, shadow measurements, and related phenomena in accelerated spacetimes.

Abstract: In this study we analyse null geodesics in an accelerated Schwarzschild black
hole sustained by a cosmic string/strut (C-metric) in the sub-extremal regime.
Using dimensionless variables and a Mino-type parameter we cast the equations
into a complete first order form. For photons the conformal Hamilton-Jacobi
equation separates and the radial and polar motion reduce to
Bierman-Weierstrass form, yielding new closed analytic solutions. This provides
a clean classification of photon trajectories, identifies a fixed photon cone
that replaces equatorial symmetry when the acceleration is nonzero, and locates
a single spherical photon surface shared by all latitudes. On the observational
side, we prove that the shadow seen by any static observer is an exact circle:
its screen radius depends on the acceleration and observer location but not on
the conicity, so the local shadow cannot bound the string tension. We provide
compact expressions for the photon ring orbital frequency and Lyapunov exponent
and use them to obtain eikonal quasinormal estimates; we also show how a single
shadow measurement at known position uniquely infers the dimensionless
acceleration. As diagnostics of the background, we compute the (generally
unequal) surface gravities of the black hole and acceleration horizons and
derive an exact redshift law between static worldlines.

a central region of exponentially small positive $g_{00}$, and hence very high
gravitational redshift.

Abstract: We present a covariantly stable first-order framework for describing charge

Working in the Lorenz gauge, we show that the associated initial value problem
is both causal and locally well-posed in the fully nonlinear regime. We then
apply such framework to explore a range of gravitothermoelectric effects in
metals undergoing relativistic acceleration. These include (1) the separation
of charge through acceleration, (2) the non-uniformity of Joule heating across
accelerating circuits due to time dilation, and (3) the effect of redshift on
magnetic diffusion. As an astrophysical application, we derive a relativistic
Thomas-Fermi equation governing the charge distribution inside a compact
object, also accounting for Seebeck charge displacements driven by cooling.

Abstract: In this paper, we adopt continued fraction method (CFM) associated with VBK
approach, which is recently developed by Vieira, Bezerra and Kokkotas, to
investigate the spectrum of quasibound states (QBS) and superradiant
instability of massive scalar perturbation imposed on analog rotating black
hole in photon-fluid model. We analyze the effects of black hole angular
velocity $\Omega_H$ and scalar field mass $\mu$ on QBS spectrum with positive
and negative winding number $m=\pm1$, respectively. In addition to the
fundamental frequency, we also investigate the overtones in order to disclose
more distinctions of spectrum between the states of $m=\pm 1$. We show that the
sign of winding number can produce notable impacts on the spectrum,
particularly to the imaginary part of the spectrum. We study the superradiant
instability and find that the maximum instability for a given $\Omega_H$ is not
in monotonic relationship with angular velocity, which is in contrast to the
case in Kerr black hole spacetime. As expected, the strength of superradiant
instability can be significantly weakened by increasing the winding number.
These findings imply that there exists a critical angular velocity under which
the instability is strongest in parameter space, and we are supposed to find it
out at $m=1$. Indeed, this max instability is found to be $\omega_{Imax}\approx
1.13374\times 10^{-5}$ related to the critical angular velocity
$\Omega_H\approx1.22$.

Abstract: We consider interactions of exact (i.e., solutions of full nonlinear field
equations) gravitational waves with matter by using the Einstein-Boltzmann
equation. For a gravitational wave interacting with a system of massless
particles, we compute the perturbed energy-momentum tensor and obtain explicit
form of a set of Einstein-Boltzmann equations. We find solution to this system
of equations to obtain the gravitational wave profile. The interaction
superposes a static term on the gravitational wave profile which depends on the
difference between square of the temperatures of the system in the absence and
in the presence of the wave. We compute this perturbed term when the states of
the system obey Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, and Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions, respectively. The relative strength of this term is roughly half
for the Fermi-Dirac, and one-third for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions
compared with that of the Bose-Einstein distribution. We consider both
Minkowski and flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that a linear electromagnetic matter source can
be constructed for regular black hole solutions, illustrated by the case of the
Bardeen black hole. Our method relies on coupling a scalar field and its
potential to General Relativity (GR) alongside electrodynamics. Both fields are
minimally coupled to GR but interact with each other. We validate this approach
by interpreting the Bardeen solution either as a purely magnetic or as a purely
electric configuration for a spherically symmetric metric with an arbitrary
electrodynamics Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(F)$ and a coupling function
$W(\varphi)$. By choosing an appropriate form of $W$, the electromagnetic
Lagrangian can be rendered linear. We then analyze the behavior of the coupling
function and the scalar field potential, emphasizing their relation to the
magnetic or electric charge. Finally, we compare the advantages and
disadvantages of this framework with the conventional formalism, in which
regular charged black holes are supported solely by nonlinear electrodynamics.

Motivation: The paper investigates the generalization of black hole solutions in General Relativity, considering different scenarios such as spherical symmetry, static geometry, and various electromagnetic field configurations. It aims to explore the theoretical foundation and implications of these solutions by introducing a nonminimally coupled scalar field with nonlinear electromagnetic interactions. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of black hole physics and the behavior of spacetime under different electromagnetic influences.

Method: The authors employ analytical methods in General Relativity to derive the BB solutions. They assume spherical symmetry and static geometry, and use action principles with scalar fields and nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangians. They introduce an interaction term between the scalar field and the electromagnetic sector, and determine the functional form of the coupling term by modeling the radial dependence of the electromagnetic Lagrangian as a power law. They analyze two specific BB solutions: the Simpson-Visser-type and the Bardeen-type, in both purely magnetic and purely electric cases. Regularity of the solutions is checked using the Kretschmann scalar, and energy conditions are discussed.

Result: The main results include the derivation of a specific form of the coupling function _W(r)_ for the BB solutions based on the power-law assumption of the electromagnetic Lagrangian's radial dependence. The authors find that the BB spacetime solutions can be described using a linear electromagnetic field in both purely magnetic and purely electric cases. Additionally, the regularity of the spacetime is maintained, and certain energy conditions are satisfied.

Conclusion: This paper provides a detailed analysis of BB solutions in General Relativity, introducing a nonminimally coupled scalar field with nonlinear electromagnetic interactions. The results demonstrate that such solutions are physically viable and maintain regularity under specific conditions. The approach used in this paper offers a new method for constructing and analyzing BB solutions, potentially opening up new avenues for theoretical exploration in black hole physics and spacetime geometry.

Abstract: Black-bounce (BB) solutions generalize the spacetimes of black holes, regular
black holes, and wormholes, depending on the values of certain characteristic
parameters. In this work, we investigate such solutions within the framework of
General Relativity (GR), assuming spherical symmetry and static geometry. It is
well established in the literature that, in order to sustain such geometries,
the source of Einstein's equations in the BB context can be composed of a
scalar field $\varphi$ and a nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). In our model, in
addition to the Lagrangian associated with the scalar field in the action, we
also include an interaction term of the form $W(\varphi)\mathcal{L}(F)$, which
introduces a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the
electromagnetic sector. Notably, the usual minimal coupling configuration is
recovered by setting $W(\varphi)=1$. In contrast to approaches where the
function $W(\varphi)$ is assumed a priori, here we determine its functional
form by modeling the radial dependence of the derivative of the electromagnetic
Lagrangian as a power law, namely $\mathcal{L}_F(r) \sim F^n$. This approach
enables us to determine $W(r)$ directly from the obtained solutions. We apply
this procedure to two specific geometries: the Simpson-Visser-type BB solution
and the Bardeen-type BB solution, both analyzed in the purely magnetic ($q_m
\neq 0$, $q_e=0$) and purely electric ($q_m=0$, $q_e \neq 0$) cases. In all
scenarios, we find that these BB spacetime solutions can be described with a
linear electrodynamics, which is a noteworthy result. Furthermore, we examine
the regularity of the spacetime through the Kretschmann scalar and briefly
discuss the associated energy conditions for the solutions obtained.

Abstract: We study scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-extremal black
hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory.
  This black hole is described by mass ($M=4\sqrt{\alpha}/3\sqrt{3}$) with
$\alpha$ quantum parameter. From studying onset of scalarization, we find the
appearance of the single branch of scalarized qOS-extremal black holes. To
obtain the tachyonic scalar cloud being a seed to generate the single branch of
scalarized qOS-extremal black holes, we consider the near-horizon geometry of
the Bertotti-Bobinson (BR) spacetime. In this case, we find that the appearance
of a large scalar cloud at the horizon ($\rho=0$) is a new feature to represent
onset scalarization of extremal black holes for tachyon with negative mass, but
it is not related to the Aretakis instability of a propagating scalar with
standard mass around the BR spacetime, showing polynomial instability of the
ingoing time $v$. The Aretakis instability is connected to the scalar cloud
with standard mass, indicating the blow-up at the horizon.

Abstract: We performed a numerical study of the dynamics of massive particles orbiting
black holes and naked singularities in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. We
modeled a stream of particles with a constant angular momentum and with a range
of energies. We then solved the geodesic equation of motion and compared the
trajectories around black holes and naked singularities by tuning the charge
parameter of the metric. The setup that we used can approximate astrophysical
scenarios such as tidal disruption events. We discussed differences and
similarities in the orbital dynamics and deflection angles. We found that
particles reflected by a black hole follow a stream-like family of orbits
within a narrow range of deflection angles, whereas in case of naked
singularities particles are scattered in all directions on the plain of motion.
We explained this behavior as an interplay between the presence of a
centrifugal barrier at the location of the unstable circular orbit and an
absorbing event horizon in case of a black hole or a reflective zero-gravity
sphere in case of a naked singularity. These qualitative differences are
expected to impact the observable signatures of tidal disruption events.

Abstract: In this work, we compute the gravitational wave displacement and spin memory
effects in de Sitter spacetime. Gravitational waves in asymptotically flat
spacetimes are described by the Bondi-Sachs framework, where radiation at null
infinity is tied to the BMS group, and memory appears as permanent changes in
the geometry. This formalism becomes more complicated when asymptotic flatness
is not guaranteed. With a positive cosmological constant, future infinity is
spacelike rather than null, and the decay of the fields differs qualitatively
from the flat case. The Bondi-Sachs methods adapted to a positive cosmological
constant show that the asymptotic symmetry algebra reduces to time translations
and rotations, and that the balance equations for charges and fluxes take a
modified form. Our calculation at leading order yields flux-balance relations
for displacement and spin memory directly in terms of the cosmological constant
Lambda and Bondi-Sachs data. We also find that the cosmological constant mixes
spherical-harmonic modes of the memory potentials, producing a (3,0) component
in displacement memory and a (2,0) component in spin memory.

Conclusion: 方法的结果在整体上是一致的，但细节上需要注意数值上的差异。

Abstract: We consider an infrared truncated massive minimally coupled scalar field with
an asymmetric self-interaction
$\frac{m^2}{2}\varphi^2\!+\!\frac{\lambda\varphi^4}{4!}\!+\!\frac{\beta\varphi^3}{3!}(\lambda\!>\!0)$
during a cosmological constant driven de Sitter inflation with a constant
expansion rate, $H$. The Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the
massive scalar field is obtained and solved for this asymmetric potential.
Firstly we compute the vacuum expectation values of $\varphi$ and $\varphi^2$
using the normalized late-time probability distribution $\rho(\varphi,t)$.
Secondly, we evaluate the two-point correlation function and the vacuum
expectation value of the massive scalar field at tree and one-loop order
following Starobinsky's approach and applying the techniques of perturbative
quantum field theory. Lastly, we compare the results obtained via these two
different methods. Although these results give consistent qualitative behavior
at tree and one-loop order, they differ numerically.

### [91] [Accounting for Tidal Deformability in Binary Neutron Star Template Banks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24461)
*Lorenzo Piccari,Francesco Pannarale*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: To improve sensitivity in gravitational wave searches for binary neutron stars, we account for tidal deformations by expanding template bank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave searches often neglect neutron star physics, reducing sensitivity. Accounting for these effects improves detectability.

Method: Extend template bank by incorporating tidal deformability as a degree of freedom, using observations of GW170817 to inform priors.

Result: The method reduces additional templates needed by approximately 8.2%.

Conclusion: This approach enhances sensitivity while keeping computational demands manageable.

Abstract: Modelled searches for gravitational waves emitted by compact binary
coalescences currently filter the data with template signals that ignore all
effects related to the physics of dense-matter in neutron stars interiors, even
when the masses in the template are compatible with a binary neutron star or a
neutron star-black hole binary source. The leading neutron star finite-size
effect is an additional phase contribution due to tidal deformations induced by
the gravitational coupling between the two inspiralling objects in the binary.
We show how neglecting this effect in the templates reduces the search
sensitivity close to the detection threshold. This is particularly true for
binary neutron stars systems, where tidal effects are larger. In this work we
therefore propose a new technique for the construction of binary neutron star
template banks that accounts for neutron star tidal deformabilities as degrees
of freedom of the parameter space to be searched over. A first attempt in this
direction was carried out by Harry & Lundgren [Physical Review D 104, 043008
(2021)], who proposed to extract randomly the tidal deformabilities of the
stars over a uniform interval, regardless of the binary neutron star component
masses. We show that this approach yields 33% additional templates with respect
to the equivalent point-like template bank. Our proposed approach, instead,
adopts a more physically motivated tidal deformability prior with a support
that is informed by the value of the neutron star mass and compatible with the
neutron star equation of state constraint provided by the observation of
GW170817. This method significantly reduces the needed additional templates to
8.2%.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解宇宙演化提供了新的视角，展示了$M(Q,C)$引力作为有效替代框架的潜力。

Abstract: The $f(Q,C)$ theory, which extends symmetric teleparallel gravity by
including the boundary term $C$ in addition to the non-metricity scalar $Q$,
provides a unifying framework that encompasses both $f(Q)$ and
$f(\mathring{R})$ gravities. In this work, we develop a comprehensive dynamical
system analysis of $f(Q,C)$ cosmology formulated within the non-coincident
affine connection branches. Unlike the coincident case, these branches
introduce a dynamical degree of freedom that significantly enriches the
cosmological phase space. We show that even for simple power-law forms of the
Lagrangian, the theory accommodates a broad spectrum of cosmic scenarios,
including successive pressureless matter eras, stiff-matter phases between
early inflation and dark matter domination, and late-time acceleration. Our
analysis demonstrates that the Universe can naturally evolve from an initial de
Sitter phase to a matter-dominated epoch and subsequently to a final de Sitter
attractor, consistent with the observed thermal history. These results
highlight the role of the dynamical connection in shaping cosmic evolution and
underline the potential of $f(Q,C)$ gravity as a viable alternative framework
for addressing outstanding issues in modern cosmology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examining unimodular conditions in higher-dimensional theories is crucial for understanding gravity's role in extra dimensions and cosmological models.

Method: The authors begin with a 5D variational principle, apply dimensional reduction, and analyze the resulting equations using perturbative methods to study the stability of solutions.

Result: Theoretical framework is established, and perturbative solutions show stability, offering insights into handling scalar fields in Kaluza-Klein theory.

Conclusion: Further research is recommended to explore perturbation outcomes and broader applicability in cosmology and scalar field interactions.

Abstract: In this article we present a possibility of imposing the unimodular condition
within the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field.
Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late 80-ties;
and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological
constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. A
generalization of the unimodularity principle to the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein
model was discussed in our recent paper, in which variational principle is
formulated in 5 dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the
resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations was
then presented and discussed. Here we present further developments of this
approach, focussing our attention at perturbative aspects and stability of
solutions.

Conclusion: 多孔方法在量子化宇宙学中提供了新的视角和技术。

Abstract: We analyze the effective dynamics of a polymer quantized homogeneous and
anisotropic Bianchi-I universe coupled to a polymer quantized scalar field. We
use a pressureless dust field as an internal clock, and work with the
gravitational Misner variables. We find that for a consistent polymer
quantization of the anisotropies, the volume variable has to be polymerized
first, and that a choice of different polymer scales for the two leads to
substantially different dynamics. We derive an effective Friedmann equation for
this model, and also compute the shear scalar. We show that polymer quantizing
the scalar field leads to significant differences in the evolution of various
cosmological quantities as compared to standard quantization. Furthermore,
there is asymmetric evolution across the bounce for both the volume variable
and the anisotropies. The amount of these variations and asymmetry, as well as
the location of the quantum bounce, depends on the matter polymer scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by experimental testing of scalar-tensor gravity as a potential extension of general relativity, particularly in high-energy physics contexts like string theory.

Method: The research employs a parameter space analysis of the dilaton model, utilizing discrete mass distribution models in low-density environments to refine continuous approximations commonly used in such studies.

Result: The findings demonstrate that a substantial portion of the model's parameter space is still accessible to future experiments, highlighting the potential of high-precision gravitational redshift measurements to constrain these models effectively.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for future experimental tests of scalar-tensor gravity models, offering new insights into their applicability within string theory frameworks.

Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity represents a natural extension of general relativity.
Testing such models experimentally provides a crucial pathway to probing
physics at high-energy scales, particularly in the context of string theory.
This paper investigates a string-theory-inspired scalar-tensor gravity -- the
dilaton model -- and identifies regions of its parameter space potentially
constrained by gravitational redshift experiments in future. By further
modeling the mass distribution in low-density environments with a discrete
representation, we go beyond the standard continuous approximation. Despite
limitations inherent to specific experimental configurations, our analysis
reveals that a significant portion of the parameter space remains accessible.
Consequently, high-precision gravitational redshift experiments hold the
potential to exclude significant regions of this parameter space in future.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate gravitational quasinormal modes of the Dymnikova black hole, a
regular spacetime in which the central singularity is replaced by a de Sitter
core. This geometry, originally proposed as a phenomenological model, also
arises naturally in the framework of Asymptotically Safe gravity, where quantum
corrections lead to a scale-dependent modification of the Schwarzschild
solution. Focusing on axial gravitational perturbations, we compute the
dominant quasinormal frequencies using the WKB method with Pad\'e approximants
and verify the results with time-domain integration. We find that the
introduction of the quantum parameter $l_{\rm cr}$ leads to systematic
deviations from the Schwarzschild spectrum: the real oscillation frequency
decreases as $l_{\rm cr}$ increases, while the damping rate also becomes
smaller, implying longer-lived modes. In the limit of large $l_{\rm cr}$, the
quasinormal spectrum smoothly approaches the Schwarzschild case. These results
suggest that even though the corrections are localized near the horizon, they
leave imprints in the gravitational-wave ringdown which may become accessible
to observation with future high-precision detectors.

Conclusion: 费米子的低频吸收可能违反广义第二定律，但玻色子满足Null能量条件时仍保持定律成立。

Abstract: We evaluate the validity of the generalied second law for Kerr black holes
perturbed by fermionic and bosonic fields. We derive that the critical
frequency for a test field below which the area of a Kerr black hole would
decrease, coincides with the superradiance limit which pertains to bosonic
fields. The fact that the absorption of fermionic fields with arbitrarily low
frequencies is allowed, leads to a generic violation of the generalized second
law as both the black hole and the environment lose entropy. The result does
not contradict the proof of the area theorem which pre-assumes the validity of
the null energy condition. We also construct a thought experiment involving
bosonic fields to check whether the minimum increase in the area can compensate
for the decrease in the entropy of the environment. We minimize the entropy
increase by considering a black hole at the extremal limit, perturbed by a
bosonic field at the superradiance limit. We show that the generalized second
law remains valid for bosonic fields that satisfy the null energy condition.
The result does not require the employment of entropy bounds when one assigns
von Neumann entropy to test fields.

Motivation: Understanding astrophysical black hole models and their shadows is crucial for interpreting observational data, making this critique important for researchers in gravitational physics and astrophysics.

Method: The critique examines the original paper's calculation of the shadow radius by Ramadhan et al. (2023) and identifies an oversight in applying the distant-observer limit of the correction term in the effective geometry.

Result: The critique argues that overlooking this limit made their calculation invalid, and when corrected, their result reverses the paper's original conclusion regarding the applicability of the regular black hole model to Sagittarius A*.

Conclusion: This critique emphasizes the importance of properly accounting for all terms in theoretical models and validates that certain models might better describe observed phenomena.

Abstract: It was suggested by Ramadhan et al. (Eur Phys J C 83:465, 2023) that the
Sagittarius A* black hole cannot be modeled by an Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\`ia regular
black hole due to the incompatible shadow radius. However, they overlooked the
distant-observer limit of the correction term in the effective geometry, which
renders their calculation invalid. When evaluated correctly, the result
reverses the conclusion of the paper. This comment highlights the flaw and
demonstrates how to properly compute the shadow radius of such a black hole
model using elementary geometry.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical study of a Schwarzschild-like
Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) influenced by a new cloud of strings (NCS)
and a dark matter halo (DMH) characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile. We
analyze the geodesic motion of both massless and massive test particles,
highlighting how the NCS and DMH parameters affect the effective potentials,
photon spheres, circular orbits, BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular
orbit (ISCO) of test particles. Additionally, we investigate the thermodynamic
behavior of the BH in an extended phase space by deriving key quantities, such
as the Hawking temperature, the equation of state (EoS), Gibbs free energy,
internal energy, and the specific heat capacity. Our results show that the
presence of NCS and DMH induces significant modifications in both the dynamical
and thermodynamical behavior of the BH, including shifts in the Hawking-Page
transition and divergences in heat capacity, thereby reshaping the phase
structure of the BH.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to constrain
quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes within the framework of loop quantum
gravity. We consider a stellar-mass object orbiting a supermassive
Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole in an equatorial eccentric trajectory. To explore
the dynamical behavior of the system, we analyze its orbital evolution under
gravitational radiation within the adiabatic approximation and the
mass-quadrupole formula for different initial orbital configurations. Our
results show that the quantum correction parameter $\hat{\alpha}$ slows down
the evolution of the orbital semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then employ
the numerical kludge method to generate the corresponding time-domain
gravitational waveforms. To assess detectability, we include Doppler modulation
due to the motion of space-based detectors and compute the frequency-domain
characteristic strain. By evaluating mismatches between response signals for
different values of $\hat{\alpha}$, we show that even small corrections
$(\hat{\alpha} \sim 10^{-5})$ produce distinguishable effects. Our analysis
suggests that future space-based detectors such as LISA can probe quantum
gravitational corrections in the strong-field regime and place constraints
significantly stronger than those from black hole shadow observations.

Abstract: Gravitational models with non-minimal couplings involving the trace of the
energy-momentum tensor have become increasingly popular. The idea of coupling
the trace of the matter tensor to the geometry can be applied to various matter
models, including relativistic perfect fluids. However, it is well-known that
the variational formulation of perfect fluids involves some technicalities. We
carefully derive the field equations including the trace coupling of a perfect
fluid using two different approaches, namely, that given by Brown using
Lagrange multipliers, and that given by Schutz using velocity potentials. We
show that previous results involving such trace couplings do not match the
results presented here. We demonstrate that our fluid's equations of motion are
consistent with the gravitational field equations. Moreover, we present a
simple on-shell argument which further supports the correctness of our results.
  Our work implies that a vast amount of the $f(R,T)$ literature using perfect
fluids needs to be revisited.

Abstract: We examine gravitational entropy growth within the formalism of Clifton,
Ellis and Tavakol (CET) applied to a class of spherically symmetric exact
solutions whose source is a shear-free fluid with energy flux in a comoving
frame. By considering these solutions as potential cosmological models, we
update previous literature that considered them only as restricted toy models
of radiating spheres collapsing in a Vaidya background. In the present paper we
examine the integrability of the CET entropy form in connection with Einstein's
equations in the fluid flow approach, proving as well that all expanding
configurations comply with the growth of CET gravitational entropy. Finally, we
examine the connection between the CET gravitational entropy and the notion of
a gravitational ``arrow of time'' based on the ratio of Weyl to Ricci
curvature. Some of the solutions also provide potentially useful and viable
inhomogeneous generalizations of FLRW models, thus suggesting an appealing
potential for applications to current cosmological research.

*Choon-Lin Ho*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the Hawking-Page phase transition using a Gibbs free energy approach, considering both additive and multiplicative noise sources. The study finds that multiplicative noise can hinder black hole formation unless certain energy conditions are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black hole thermodynamics and phase transitions have been a significant area of study in theoretical physics, and understanding the role of noise in these processes adds new insights into their stochastic nature.

Method: The authors use a Fokker-Planck equation framework, incorporating both additive and multiplicative noise models to study black hole phase transitions. They derive an effective free energy function and analyze its behavior under different noise profiles.

Result: The study reveals that multiplicative noise generally makes black hole formation less likely. However, specific noise profiles where additive and multiplicative extremes align can allow black hole formation under certain conditions.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the understanding of phase transitions in black holes under noisy conditions, highlighting the role of noise intensity and its functional dependence on the horizon radius in black hole formation.

Abstract: A recent interesting development on the dynamics of black hole phase
transitions, the Hawking-Page transition, has been the so-called Gibbs free
energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a
canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon
radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is
defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius
treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond
to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free
energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an
associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of
black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which
is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the
Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by
considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale
with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can
be used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black
hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes
under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy
become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some
theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing
functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise
disfavors the formation of black hole.

Abstract: We numerically study the Euclidean quantum cosmology of a closed, homogeneous
and isotropic universe with a cosmological constant. A dust field acts as a
clock, and we compute the ground state wavefunction, correlation function, and
mean volume of the universe by performing path integral Monte Carlo
simulations. To make the path integral convergent, the argument of the exponent
in the weight of the path integral is chosen to be either the absolute value of
the Euclidean action, or its square. We compare our results to the standard
case (with a hard cutoff at zero action), and find that the absolute value
produces similar results, whereas the squared method gives substantially
different results. We detail two different methods of `fixing' the squared
case, and test them for the simple harmonic oscillator, and for this
cosmological model. We also find that for a large positive cosmological
constant, the universe undergoes multiple cycles of expansion and contraction
for all three weights, and reaches much larger sizes with the squared weight.

Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of several families of
higher-dimensional regular black holes arising in gravitational theories that
incorporate an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections to Einstein
gravity. Our analysis focuses on how the ringdown phase of gravitational waves
for such regular black holes deviates from the predictions of General
Relativity. We employ the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method to calculate
the quasinormal modes and to derive compact analytic expressions in the eikonal
approximation. Our results contribute to understanding how possible
quantum-gravity-motivated corrections and regularity conditions can manifest in
gravitational-wave signals.

Abstract: We report high-precision resistance measurements on quantum Hall resistance

Abstract: The ongoing discoveries of graphene-based superconductors underscore the
quest to understand the structure of new superconducting orders. We develop a
theory that facilitates the use of the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) for
that purpose. This work investigates momentum-conserving tunneling across a
planar junction formed by a normal monolayer graphene tip and a superconducting
graphene sample within the QTM setting. We show that the bias dependence of the
zero-temperature tunneling conductance exhibits singularities that provide
momentum-resolved information about the Bogoliubov quasiparticle spectra,
including the superconducting gap. Using a model of superconducting twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG), we illustrate that simultaneously tuning the tip doping
level and the tip-sample twist angle allows for measuring the momentum-resolved
superconducting gap in TBG. Our results indicate that momentum-conserving
tunneling spectroscopy with the QTM is a promising method for exploring
superconductivity in two-dimensional van der Waals materials.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the electron tunneling in dual-gated bilayer
graphene-based $n/p$ junctions. It is shown that a band gap is introduced by
tuning the gate voltage, which modifies the pseudospin polarization and breaks
anti-Klein tunneling at normal incidence. Specifically, when the pseudospin
polarization vectors for the propagating and evanescent wave modes on the left
and right regions of the junction are orthogonal, a revival of Klein tunneling
is achieved. The Berry phase associated with Klein tunneling in dual-gated
bilayer graphene is not limited to $\pi$ but varies with the junction
parameters. Furthermore, the Klein tunneling is accompanied by a $\pi$ jump in
the reflection phase around the normal incidence.

Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional superconducting lattice that realizes all
internal symmetries permitted in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by
nonreciprocal hopping, onsite dissipation, and $s$-wave singlet pairing in a
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type structure. The combined presence of
pseudo-Hermiticity and sublattice symmetry imposes constraints on the energy
spectra. We identify parameter regimes featuring real spectra, purely imaginary
spectra, complex flat bands, and Majorana zero modes, the latter emerging when
a uniform transverse magnetic field suppresses the non-Hermitian skin effect.
We show that a uniform onsite dissipation is essential for stabilizing the zero
modes, whereas a purely staggered dissipation destroys the topological
superconductivity. Through Hermitianization, we construct a spectral winding
number as a topological invariant and demonstrate its correspondence with the
gap closing conditions and appearance of the Majorana zero modes, allowing us
to establish topological phase diagrams. Moreover, we reveal nontrivial
correlations between the particle-hole and spin components of left and right
eigenstates, enforced by chiral symmetry, pseudo-Hermiticity, and their
combination. Our results highlight how non-Hermiticity, sublattice structure,
and superconductivity together enrich symmetry properties and give rise to
novel topological phenomena.

Abstract: Quantum metric, a fundamental component of quantum geometry, has attracted
broad interest in recent years due to its critical role in various quantum
phenomena. Meanwhile, band topology, which serves as an important framework in
condensed matter physics, has led to the discovery of various topological
phases. In this work, we introduce a bilayer Dirac model that allows precise
tuning of both properties. Our approach combines two Dirac Hamiltonians with
distinct energy scales; one producing relatively dispersive bands and the other
yielding relatively flat bands. The dispersive and flat bands are weakly
coupled via hybridization $\lambda$. By inducing a band inversion in the layer
subspace, we achieve flexible tuning of band topology across all
Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and quantum metric scaling as $g \propto
1/\lambda^2$ near band inversion point. Using the bilayer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model, we investigate the localization properties of gapless boundary states,
which are affected by quantum metric. Our work lays a foundation for exploring
the interplay between band topology and quantum metric.

Abstract: The spin of the electron has been a key enabler to realize spintronics
devices that harness the spin degree of freedom beyond conventional
charge-based electronics. In addition to spin, electrons have another degree of
freedom associated with the angular momentum: orbital angular momentum. While
spintronics has evolved fast and spintronics concepts are now used in magnetic
sensors and nonvolatile memories, exploiting orbital angular momentum has just
started to be studied. Phenomena mediated by orbital angular momentum have led
to a new branch of spintronics called orbitronics. This Perspective discusses
how orbitronics can constitute the next step in the evolution of spintronics by
reviewing the current understandings and experimental results of orbital
effects and summarizing the open questions. Prospects and challenges for
devices in particular in non-volatile memory are discussed as an applications
perspective.

Abstract: We report magnetoelectric coupling in nanoparticle assemblies that persists
to temperatures over 300 times lower than in previous studies. The ME response
saturates at low temperature, revealing a quantum plateau of the coupling. A
field dependence analysis shows a crossover from quadratic to linear behavior,
captured by a phenomenological expansion $C(B,T) \simeq C_0(T) + a_1(T) B +
a_2(T) B^2$. The magnitude of the extracted quadratic coefficient, $|a_2(T)|$,
follows a power law $|a_2(T)| \sim T^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.15$,
indicating proximity to a quantum critical regime. The observed saturation
reflects a new intrinsic energy scale, distinct from finite-size or extrinsic
effects. These results establish nanoparticle assemblies as a new platform for
studying quantum magnetoelectric phenomena.

Motivation: There is a need for accurate characterization of MNPs' magnetization dynamics for high-precision temperature estimation in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNPH).

Method: The perturbation method was applied to derive analytical expressions from the Fokker-Planck equation, which characterizes MNPs' magnetization behaviors under AC and DC fields. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the model, and a temperature analysis model based on magnetization harmonics was constructed.

Result: The derived analytical expressions are validated through numerical simulations, yielding a temperature estimation error of less than 0.0151 K (first harmonic ratio) and less than 0.0218 K (first harmonic phase). These results demonstrate high accuracy and applicability in MNPH and MNP imaging.

Conclusion: The analytical expressions enhance the accuracy of MNP-based temperature measurements and expand their applicability in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia and imaging.

Abstract: Brownian relaxation is one of the primary mechanisms that allows magnetic
nanoparticles (MNPs) to convert magnetic energy into thermal energy under an
excitation magnetic field. Accurately characterizing the MNPs' magnetization
dynamics dominated by Brownian relaxation is crucial for achieving
high-precision temperature estimation. However, the lack of a readily
applicable analytical expression remains a major obstacle to the advancement of
magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNPH). In this paper, the perturbation
method was applied to derive analytical expressions from the Fokker-Planck
equation, which characterized MNPs' magnetization behaviors under the AC and DC
magnetic fields. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the accuracy
of the analytical expressions and to explore the correlation between
temperature and the magnetization response. Then, a temperature analysis model
based on magnetization harmonics was constructed. The first and second harmonic
ratios and first harmonic phase were used to calculate MNPs' temperature,
respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that within 310 K to 320 K,
the estimation error of the temperature using the amplitude ratio of the first
to second harmonics is below 0.0151 K, while the error using the first harmonic
phase is below 0.0218 K. The derived analytical expressions are expected to
enhance the accuracy of MNP-based temperature measurements and facilitate their
broader applications in MNPH and MNP imaging.

Abstract: Structural defects in 2D-transition metal dichalcogenides are critical in
modulating their optical and electrical behavior. Nevertheless, precise defect
control within the monolayer regime poses a significant challenge. Herein, a
high-energy (1MeV) electron beam irradiation strategy is harnessed to induce
defects in monolayer MoS2. Controlled variation of electron-beam irradiation
time tunes the defect density, as reflected by the evolution of defect-mediated
photoluminescence characteristics. The optically active defect emission
appearing at approx. 200-300meV below the A exciton at 85K exhibits a
systematic increase in intensity with prolonged exposure and saturates at
higher laser excitation power. Circular polarization-resolved photoluminescence
spectroscopy reveals strong suppression of valley polarization of the A exciton
after irradiation. Complementary x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies
enhanced Mo-O bonding signatures in MoS2 following irradiation. Kelvin probe
force microscopy indicates the transition to p-type doping behaviour. A
detailed temperature and power-dependent photoluminescence measurements further
elucidate the optical behaviour of these defect states. Density functional
theory calculations using these configurations establish that the transition
between the conduction band and acceptor states within the bandgap accounts for
the defect emission. This work presents a tunable route for defect engineering
in monolayer TMDs, enabling controlled tailoring of their structural and
optical properties for optoelectronic, electronic and valleytronic
applications.

Abstract: Interfaces between materials or phases -- whether in condensed matter
systems, biological membranes, or catalytic surfaces -- are rich with phenomena
that are fundamentally distinct from those present in the bulk. In some cases,
interfaces host quasiparticles, such as surface plasmons or Majorana fermions,
which can significantly influence the material properties. Here, we investigate
a unique 1D interface formed between two monolayer 2D semiconductors, MoSe2,
and WSe2, and unambiguously observe a new type of excitonic quasiparticle that
resides exclusively at the boundary. Our optical measurements reveal several
remarkable properties of this interfacial exciton. First, it possesses an
in-plane dipole moment with exceptionally large dipole lengths of 2nm. The
emission spectrum reveals narrow discrete states, indicating strong quantum
confinement of the center-of-mass motion across the interface. Power-dependent
measurements show a sublinear saturation behavior, reflecting interactions
between dipolar excitons in this low-dimensional system. Moreover, the exciton
displays striking sensitivity to charge carriers due to its dipolar character.
Our results introduce a new platform for exploring interacting 1D dipolar
bosonic systems with unique quantum properties and open pathways for novel
optoelectronic devices, including applications in nonlinear quantum photonics.

Abstract: A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal
symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic ordering. In rhombohedral (RH) stacked
graphene, the angular momentum breaking TRS can result from the orbital degree
of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and
occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in
Berry curvature between the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of
orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG),
achieved without the introduction of a moir\'e superlattice. At moderate
displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and
hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier
density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular
magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of
the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This
interplay between valley polarization, orbital magnetism, and electric and
magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of RHG. Our
findings present crystalline RHG as a minimal, tunable platform for studying
symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering
insight into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric
response.

Abstract: The realization of robust Majorana zero modes (MZMs), a cornerstone for
fault-tolerant quantum computing, is hindered by the challenge of creating a
platform that simultaneously offers a large topological gap, high tunability,
and resilience to disorder. A system unifying these properties has remained
elusive. Here, we propose and validate a novel platform that harnesses the
Meissner effect in a topological insulator (TI) nanowire partially covered by a
superconducting (SC) layer. Under an external magnetic field, Meissner
screening currents in the SC induce a spatially varying Doppler shift on the TI
surface. This effect generates a highly anisotropic effective g-factor, which
selectively drives a topological phase transition localized on the nanowire's
bottom surface. This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the
topological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced
superconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the
interface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the
topological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our
platform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's
topologically protected surface states. Through a combination of supercurrent
simulations, self-consistent Schr\"odinger-Poisson calculations, and
large-scale tight-binding computations, we validate the platform's robustness.
Our work establishes a practical pathway toward Meissner-mediated topological

Abstract: The magnetic spin Hall effect is a time-reversal-odd phenomenon in which spin
current is induced by the charge current. In the presence of a spin-orbit
coupling and/or noncolinear magnetism, however, spin current is not uniquely
defined. Instead, we study an intrinsic response of spin to an electric field
gradient that describes the spin accumulation at the boundaries of magnetic
systems. We derive a generic formula expressed by Bloch wave functions and
apply it to a minimal model for representative altermagnets, RuO$_{2}$ and
MnF$_{2}$. Our results show that the intrinsic spin accumulation can be nonzero
in magnetic insulators in sharp contrast to the magnetic spin Hall
conductivity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Using time dependent simulations, we analyze the trajectories of electrons
released from a quantum dot in a waveguide made of a spin-orbit-coupled
material (InSb). An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an
electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction
and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like
trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the
electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when
connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory
persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete
initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical
calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full
quantum mechanical simulations

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nanotechnology's demand for precise 3D nanostructures has driven the need for better understanding and control of deposition techniques like FEBID.

Method: The authors developed a model based on surface kinetics of ligands, considering their dissociation and desorption. They validated the model experimentally using chromium and silver precursors and compared the results with literature data.

Result: The model successfully predicts trends in metallic composition as a function of electron exposure time and flux, validated experimentally and compared with literature.

Conclusion: This framework enhances understanding of FEBID dynamics and provides a versatile tool for predicting and designing nanoprinted materials.

Abstract: Recent advances in nanotechnology have created the need to manufacture
three-dimensional nanostructures with controlled material composition. Focused
Electron Beam Induced Deposition (FEBID) is a nanoprinting technique offering
highest spatial resolution combined with the ability to directly 3D-print
almost any shape. It relies on local electron-induced dissociation of
metal-ligand organometallic molecules adsorbed onto a substrate. So far FEBID
continuum modelling involved the surface kinetics of precursor molecules during
electron irradiation and succeeded in the prediction of nanoprint shape and
growth rate and forms nowadays the basis of software for 3D nano-printing of
nanostructures. Here, we expand the model to the surface kinetics of detached
ligands. Involving their dissociation and desorption behavior allows to predict
trends in the metallic composition of the nanoprinted material and to define
desirable nanoprint process windows as function of electron exposure time and
flux. We present the theoretical foundations of the model, validate it
experimentally for chromium and silver precursors, compare calculated values
with literature data for various precursors, and discuss its potential to
design new experiments. This contribution enhances our understanding of FEBID
dynamics and provides a versatile framework for predictive FEBID material
nano-printing.

Abstract: We explore the Mott insulating phases of dual-species bosonic spinor lattice
gases, emphasizing the intriguing interplay between synthetic flux and
inter-species spin exchange interaction. One of the species is subjected to
Raman assisted tunneling, which leads to a synthetic flux within the framework
of synthetic dimensions. In the deep Mott regime, the low energy physics is
governed by an unconventional and highly tunable spin model, which is
characterized by two distinct spin chains. The synthetic flux serves as an
effective spin-orbit coupling, inducing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in
one of the spin chains. The inter-species spin exchange interaction gives rise
to the inter-chain coupling embodied as an isotropic XX interaction. Using
time-evolving block decimation method for tensor network states, we compute
order parameters, correlation functions and structure factors to identify the
ground state magnetic phases. The DM interaction in one species, when combined
with the inter-species spin-exchange interaction, can induce spiral magnetic
order in the second, otherwise non-chiral species. Besides, the interplay of a
transverse field applied to one spin chain and the inter-species coupling can
drive both spin chains into a paramagnetic phase simultaneously. These results
reveal that inter-species coupling serves as a powerful conduit for
transmitting magnetic correlations, enabling exotic phases beyond the
single-component perspective.

Abstract: Ultracold diatomic molecules have achieved significant breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling the exploration of quantum chemistry, precision
measurements, and strongly correlated many-body physics. Extending ultracold
molecular complexity to polyatomic molecules, such as triatomic and tetratomic
molecules, has attracted considerable interest. However, the realization of
ultracold polyatomic molecules remains technically challenging due to their
complex energy-level structures. While only a few experiments have successfully
demonstrated the formation of polyatomic molecules by magnetoassociation or
electroassociation, here we present the first step toward producing tetratomic
molecules through the development of a microwave association technique combined
with microwave dressing. When the two lowest rotational states of the molecules
are dressed by a microwave field, weakly bound tetramer states emerge in the
entrance channel with free dark excited states $\ket{0}$ and a dressed state
$\ket{+}$. The spectroscopy of these weakly bound tetramers is probed by
another microwave field that drives transitions from the populated dressed
states $\ket{+}$. By precisely discriminating the complex hyperfine structure
of the dark excited level $\ket{0}$ from the dressed-state spectroscopy, the
binding energy of the tetratomic molecules is measured and characterized. Our
work contributes to the understanding of complex few-body physics within a
system of microwave-dressed molecules and may open an avenue toward the
creation and control of ultracold polyatomic molecules.

Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg
ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and
uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at
half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg
hopping is allowed. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a
function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on,
the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced
topological phase transition as a function of interaction. Moreover, we show
that for both the non-interacting and interacting cases, topological nature of
the system survives even by altering the dimerization pattern in the dimerized
leg, resulting in two topological phases of opposite character. Finally, we
reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the
ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density
wave (CDW) phase.

Abstract: Emergent collective excitations constitute a hallmark of interacting quantum
many-body systems, yet in solid-state platforms their study has been largely
limited by the constraints of linear-response probes and by finite momentum
resolution. We propose to overcome these limitations by combining the spatial
resolution of ultracold atomic systems with the nonlinear probing capabilities
of two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DS). As a concrete illustration, we analyze
momentum-resolved 2DS of the quantum sine-Gordon model describing the low
energy dynamics of two weakly coupled one-dimensional Bose-Einstein
condensates. This approach reveals distinctive many-body signatures, most
notably asymmetric cross-peaks reflecting the interplay between isolated ($B_2$
breather) and continuum ($B_1$ pair) modes. The protocol further enables direct
characterization of anharmonicity and disorder, establishing momentum-resolved
2DS as both a powerful diagnostic for quantum simulators and a versatile probe
of correlated quantum matter.

Abstract: We show experimentally and theoretically that vortex-shaped structures in the
photoelectron momentum distribution can be observed for atoms interacting with
a single intense elliptically polarized laser pulse. Our analysis reveals that
these spiral structures are the result of destructive interference of two
dominant photoelectron vortex states, which are released into the continuum by
strong-field ionization. An electron born into one of those states is
temporarily delayed near the atomic core by the combined atomic and laser
potential, leading to fast changes in the phase delay with energy for
photoelectrons in these vortex states. Our results open the door to studying
electron dynamics of vortex states in strong-field ionization.

Abstract: Within the framework of the second order of the non-relativistic quantum
perturbation theory, the analytical structure and absolute values of the
generalized cross-sections of the two-photon resonant single ionization of the
K-shell of heavy beryllium-like ions of titanium (Ti18+), chromium (Cr20+),
iron (Fe22+) and zinc (Zn26+) atoms were predicted. The complete wave functions
of the ground state of the ion and the states of its ionization are obtained in
the single-configuration Hartree-Fock approximation. The effects of (a) the
occurrence of giant resonances in the subthreshold region of the generalized
ionization cross-sections, (b) destructive quantum interference of the
probability amplitudes of radiation transitions to intermediate states of
p-symmetry, and (c) the leading role of the d-symmetry of the final ionization
state in determining the values of the total generalized cross-section in the
region of energies of absorbed photons of the hard X-ray range were
established. A scheme of the proposed experiment with linearly polarized X-ray
photons is presented to verify the theoretical results obtained.

Abstract: We present the first fully ab initio calculations of collision-induced

($\bar{p}$He$^{+}$) perturbed by atomic helium. To overcome critical
limitations of previous studies, we construct a new highly accurate potential
energy surface (PES) that spans a wide range of $\bar{p}$He$^{+}$-He geometries
relevant to all metastable states of the exotic helium atom. Rigorous quantum
scattering calculations performed using the new PES yield scattering
$S$-matrices from which we extract pressure broadening and shift coefficients
for 50 transitions in antiprotonic helium-4 ($\bar{p}^{4}$He$^{+}$). This
dataset provides the first rigorous benchmark for earlier semiclassical
calculations and establishes a robust theoretical reference for high-precision
spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium, which is used to test the fundamental
charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry. The results extend to
temperatures relevant to non-gaseous phases of helium, supporting a new class
of precision measurements. This study introduces a methodological framework for
future investigations of other exotic systems, such as pionic or kaonic helium
atoms, enabling the development of reference data for high-precision
spectroscopy of these species - an essential component for improving the
determination of the pion and kaon masses.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Calculations have been made for the double differential cross section (DDCS)
for the ionization of metastable hydrogen atoms in the 3S state by electron and
positron impact at energies of 150 eV and 250 eV. The authors implemented the
second Born approximation to the multiple scattering theory as their model,
evaluated the corresponding analytical expressions using Bethe and Lewis
integrals, and numerically computed them using MATLAB. The generated DDCS
captures the features of both recoil and binary fragmentation and, at the same
time, provides an overall qualitative consistency with earlier studies,
although some differences can be found between them at certain emission angles.
The present work, therefore, supplies new theoretical reference levels for
ionization investigations in hydrogen-like systems, now that no experimental
data are available for the metastable 3S state.

TL;DR: This paper describes a novel quantum computation platform using circular Rydberg atoms combined with a secondary array of ancilla atoms, enabling quantum non-demolition detection and manipulation of qubits for improved computation and simulation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely focused on advancing quantum computing through novel methods of qubit manipulation and detection, leveraging the unique properties of circular Rydberg atoms.

Method: The method involves using an array of circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium, which are specifically laser-trapped, and an auxiliary array of ancilla atoms that are transiently excited to low-ℓ Rydberg levels. They employ a hybrid platform that performs quantum non-demolition detection and manipulation by utilizing the blockade effect from a F"orster resonance for detection and ancilla excitation for local qubit manipulation.

Result: The result is a highly promising platform that adds mid-circuit measurements and enables access to time correlations useful for long-term quantum simulations, particularly significant as circular Rydberg atoms have unique interaction properties.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this hybrid platform enhances the capabilities of quantum computation and simulation by introducing new methods for qubit measurement and manipulation, capitalizing on the unique properties of circular Rydberg atoms.

Abstract: Among the thriving quantum computation and quantum simulation platforms based
on arrays of Rydberg atoms, those using circular Rydberg atoms are particularly
promising. These atoms uniquely combine the strong dipole-dipole interactions
typical of Rydberg states with long lifetimes. However, low-angular-momentum
($\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because
circular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual
detection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform,
combining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium
with an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\ell$
Rydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical
qubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation
induced by a F\"orster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical
qubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is
highly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the
circular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error
correction. More strikingly, it gives access to time correlations in long-term
quantum simulations, uniquely accessible to circular Rydberg atoms.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for quantizing constrained quantum systems in
which the processes of quantization and constraint enforcement are performed
simultaneously. The approach is based on an extension of the stationary action
principle, incorporating an information-theoretic term arising from vacuum
fluctuations. Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange
multipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum
dynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction.
We demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system
with vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the
time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac
quantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global
translational invariance, where all three methods agree. These results show
that the proposed framework generalizes standard quantization schemes and
provides a consistent treatment of systems with constraints that cannot be
expressed as linear operators acting on the wave function. In addition to a
unified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism
also offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising
from vacuum fluctuations.

Abstract: Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent
dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive
monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into
non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination
of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed
with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that
samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map
scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to
steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This
competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical
dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy
simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics
models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high
accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized
in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates
and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this
experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅行 salesman 问题是组合优化领域中的一个著名难题，在调度、路径优化和电路优化等领域都有应用。然而，该问题属于NP难问题，随着站点数量增加，组合数呈指数级增长。传统的量子退火器和 adiabatic 量子计算机在解决该问题方面有优势，但通用量子计算机受量子位数量限制。因此，为了更高效地利用量子资源，提出了一种新方法。

Abstract: Traveling salesman problems (TSP) are one of the well-known combinatorial
optimization problems that many groups tackle to solve. This problem appears in
many types of combinational optimization, such as scheduling, route
optimization, and circuit optimization. However, this problem is NP-hard, as
the number of combinations increases exponentially as the number of sites
increases. Quantum Annealers and Adiabatic Quantum Computers are good at
solving it, and universal quantum computers are limited by the number of qubits
they have. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that solves it using a
Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold network (VQKAN). Our approach requires a
smaller number of qubits than the former approaches on quantum computers. We
confirmed that our approach can optimize the paths on the graphs whose length
of each path is time-dependent, partial.

Abstract: In this letter, by an approach that employs Weyl symbols for operators, a
semiclassical theory is developed for the offdiagonal function in the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which is for offdiagonal elements
$\langle{E_i}\left|O\right|{E_j}\rangle$ of an observable $O$ on the energy
basis. It is shown analytically that the matrix of $O$ has a banded structure,
possessing a bandwidth $w_b$ that scales linearly with $\hbar$, a phase-space
gradient of the classical Hamiltonian, $\langle\left|{\boldsymbol{\nabla
}H_{\rm cl}}\right|\rangle$, and an $O$-dependent property. This predicts that
the thermalization timescale of a quantum system may be inversely proportional
to the phase-space gradient of the Hamiltonian, aligning with intuitions in
classical thermalization. This approach also elucidates the origin of a
$\rho_{\rm dos}^{-1/2}$-scaling of the offdiagonal function. The analytical
predictions are checked numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.

Abstract: The usual position-momentum commutation relation plays a fundamental role in
the mathematical description of continuous-variable quantum systems. In the
case of a qudit described by a Hilbert space of a high enough dimension, there
exists a discrete version of the position-momentum commutation relation
approximately satisfied by a large part of the pure quantum states. Our purpose
is to explore in more details the set of these states. We show that it contains
a family of discrete-variable Gaussian states depending on a continuous
parameter and certain discrete coherent states. It also contains various
discrete-variable versions of the Hermite-Gauss states, defined either as
eigenstates of certain discrete versions of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian
or generated by using a discrete version of the creation or annihilation
operator. As a direct consequence, a discrete version of the incertitude
relation is satisfied by the considered quantum states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a \emph{novel} and scalable supervised machine learning framework
to predict open-quantum system dynamics and detect non-Markovian memory using
only local ancilla measurements. A system qubit is coherently coupled to an
ancilla via a symmetric XY Hamiltonian; the ancilla interacts with a noisy
environment and is the only qubit we measure. A feedforward neural network,
trained on short sliding windows of supplementary data from the past, forecasts
the observable system $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ without state tomography or
knowledge of the bath.
  To quantify memory, we introduce a normalized revival-based metric that
counts upward 'turn-backs' in \emph{predicted} $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ and
reports the fraction of evaluated samples that exceeds a small threshold. This
bounded score provides an interpretable, model-independent indicator of
non-Markovianity.
  We demonstrate the method on two representative noise channels, non-unital
amplitude damping and unital dephasing from random telegraph noise (RTN). Under
matched conditions, the model accurately reproduces the dynamics and flags
memory effects, with RTN exhibiting a larger normalized revival score than
amplitude damping. Overall, the approach is experimentally realistic and
readily extensible, enabling real-time, interpretable non-Markovian diagnostics
from accessible local measurements.

Conclusion: 这项研究为从实际的 quench 实验中提取量子临界数据提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Measuring universal data in the strongly correlated regime of quantum
critical points remains a fundamental objective for quantum simulators. In
foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the
dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field
theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely
successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the
critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local
observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular,
the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via
imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics
of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions:
ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling
collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of
conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the
finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field
theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data
to be extracted from realistic quenches.

Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) reveals that frequent measurements can suppress
quantum evolution, but the detailed dynamics of the system under
finite-duration measurements in experiments remain insufficiently explored.
Here, we employ an optical dipole trap as a projective measurement to study the
motion of a single cold atom in free space. By monitoring atomic loss, we
directly observe the QZE in single-atom motion in free space and find that the
effect of dipole measurements on the atom comprises a short-time collapse
followed by subsequent periodic unitary evolution, thereby providing an
intuitive physical picture of measurement backaction across different
timescales. We further investigate the effects of measurement frequency,
strength, and spatial position, demonstrating that measurements not only
suppress the spreading of quantum states but also enable deterministic
preparation of distinct motional states. Furthermore, by dynamically
controlling the measurement position, we achieve measurement-induced
directional transport of a single atom without imparting additional momentum.
Our results provide a direct experimental demonstration of the QZE in real
space and establish a versatile framework for measurement-based control of
atomic motion, paving the way for motional-state engineering in cold-atom
platforms.

### [144] [Cost-aware Photonic Graph State Generation: A Graphical Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22777)
*Sobhan Ghanbari,Hoi-Kwong Lo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cost-aware framework for the deterministic generation of photonic graph states using emitter-based methods, addressing scalability issues in quantum computation and communication. The framework minimizes the number of two-qubit gates and enhances efficiency by optimizing the use of emitters, offering substantial cost reductions compared to alternative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work stems from the need for scalable and resource-efficient methods to generate photonic graph states, which are essential for quantum computation and communication. Current approaches, while effective, often require significant technological resources, such as numerous two-qubit gates or extensive quantum circuit depths, limiting their practicality. This paper aims to address these scalability issues by introducing a novel framework that reduces the resource requirements for generating graph states.

Method: The method employed in the paper involves the development of a cost-aware framework that provides a systematic approach to optimizing the generation of photonic graph states. This framework is built on a set of elementary graph operations that govern the evolution of the state toward the target. A key component of the method is the Graph Builder algorithm, which minimizes the number of two-qubit gates needed for generating photonic graph states. The algorithm is designed to use the minimum number of emitters for a fixed emission sequence while also allowing for the use of additional emitters to trade off between the number of emitters and other cost metrics. The framework also systematically identifies degrees of freedom at each stage of the generation process, enabling a comprehensive characterization of the optimization landscape for further cost reductions.

Result: The results of the study demonstrate that the proposed framework and Graph Builder algorithm significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates required for the generation of both random and structured photonic graph states. These reductions are on an order of magnitude compared to alternative approaches, making the generation of large-scale photonic graph states more feasible. Additionally, the algorithm is shown to support controlled trade-offs between the number of emitters and other cost metrics, providing flexibility in optimizing the generation process according to specific requirements. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and comparisons with existing methods, confirming its effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency and scalability of emitter-based photonic graph state generation.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper presents a comprehensive and versatile framework for the optimization of emitter-based photonic graph state generation, addressing key challenges in scalability and resource efficiency. By introducing the Graph Builder algorithm and systematically optimizing the use of emitters and two-qubit gates, the framework provides a robust solution for advancing photonic quantum information processing. This approach not only reduces the technological requirements for generating photonic graph states but also offers a systematic method for further optimizing the generation process, paving the way for more scalable and efficient quantum computation and communication systems.

Abstract: Photonic graph states are essential resources for quantum computation and
communication. Deterministic emitter-based generation of graph states overcomes
the scalability issues of probabilistic approaches, but their experimental
realization is constrained by technological demands, often expressed by the
number of two-qubit gates and the depth and/or width of the quantum circuits
used to model the generation process. We introduce a cost-aware framework for
the generation of photonic graph states of arbitrary size and shape, built on a
complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions and a universal set of
elementary graph operations that govern the evolution of the state toward the
target. Within this framework, we develop Graph Builder, a deterministic
generation algorithm that achieves substantial reductions (up to an order of
magnitude) in two-qubit gate usage for both random and structured graphs,
compared with alternative approaches. The algorithm uses the minimum number of
emitters possible for a fixed emission sequence, while also supporting the use
of extra emitters for controlled trade-offs between emitter count and other
cost metrics. Moreover, by systematically identifying the degrees of freedom at
each stage of the generation process, this framework fully characterizes the
optimization landscape, enabling analytic, heuristic, or exhaustive strategies
for further cost reductions. Our approach provides a general and versatile tool
for designing and optimizing emitter-based photonic graph state generation
protocols, essential for scalable and resource-efficient photonic quantum
information processing.

Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry is an effective tool for precision sensing, but
it faces a fundamental trade-off between dynamic range and measurement
precision. To overcome this limitation, we sample the frequencies of two
interfering photons, which extends the sensitivity in the time domain. This
enhances the dynamic range of optical delay estimation by up to twenty times
compared to the non-resolved estimates. We demonstrate this approach with
independent photon sources and show the precision scaling with the detector
frequency resolution. This technique enables scan-free nanometre resolution
depth sensing over a millimetre-scale range, with applications in biological
and nanomaterial imaging.

Motivation: 随着量子电池技术的发展，如何提升其性能和效率是一个关键问题，尤其是如何利用环境（尤其是热浴）来增强电池工作能力。相关热浴和量子相干性在量子热力学中的作用受到广泛关注。

Method: 研究采用了一维自旋-1/2模型，通过相位衰变和幅度阻尼噪声将电池与热浴连接，并在两种不同热浴模型下进行了数值模拟。

Result: 1. 相关性热浴显著提升电池性能，脱相噪声下即使电池初始状态为积态，也能提取有限的功，而本地噪声下积态初始状态同样存在储能量但无法提取。2. 这种优势在更大的系统大小和不同初始态（纠缠态和积态）下均得以保持。3. 量子相干性与功的关系类似于其自身的演化，表明相干性是增强电池性能的关键资源。4. 从量子电池中提取的能和储能量的比例在脱相噪声下与系统大小无关，在幅度阻尼下则在短期内随系统大小增加。5. 当电池动力学由长程相互作用的有意哈密顿ian描述时，与短程相互作用相比，具有更高功的热力学性能，提示了在设备设计中通过工程热浴提高能效的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过本地相关性热浴，量子电池在短期操作中能够显著提升能被提取，且该性能特征在系统规模增长下保持不变，蕴藏着重大的理论和应用潜力。而零相关性的热浴则无法如此显著地提升电池性能，可能是现有电池设计中仍有改进的空间。这些结果强调了在量子热力学中利用相关性作为资源的重要性，同时也为未来的量子电池设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Going beyond isolated system dynamics, we examine how local and spatially
correlated reservoirs influence the work extraction in quantum batteries. By
employing a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model coupled to baths via dephasing and
amplitude-damping noise, we demonstrate that correlations in reservoirs can
significantly enhance battery's performance compared to local noise. In the
dephasing scenario, we prove that correlated reservoirs produce a finite amount
of extractable work, or ergotropy, during the transient regime when a two-cell
battery is initialized in a product state while local noise yields vanishing
ergotropy at all times, despite nonvanishing stored energy in both cases.
Numerical simulations confirm that this advantage persists across larger system
sizes and for both entangled and product initial states. We also find that the
dynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting
coherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum
batteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted
from quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and
local reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains
independent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits
a clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting
distinct operational behaviors under different noise models. In addition, we
reveal that when the battery dynamics is governed by an effective Hamiltonian
with long-range interactions, it yields higher ergotropy compared to
short-range interactions, emphasizing the advantages of reservoir engineering
for efficient device design.

*Yunfei Wang,Xin Jin,Junyu Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a new approach to solving the LWE problem using AdS/CFT and holographic algorithms, but argues that the required computations are not feasible within polynomial time, thereby maintaining the quantum computational hardness of LWE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses recent advancements in quantum cryptography and computational complexity, highlighting a potential connection between LWE-based cryptography and quantum gravity, which raises questions about the practicality of certain cryptographic methods in light of quantum computing.

Method: Holographic quantum algorithms are developed based on the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Specific measurements, such as heavy-field two-point functions and bulk covariance matrix reconstruction, are employed to analyze entropy differences. The complexity of these algorithms is analyzed in terms of the number of measurements and computational time required.

Result: The study demonstrates that the computations required to measure entanglement entropy align with the quantum cryptanalytic hardness of LWE. This conclusion is reached by comparing the necessary computational resources to the capabilities of algorithms like BKZ, which are currently infeasible to break the security of LWE-based cryptography.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of holographic dualities in the context of quantum cryptography by providing a computational complexity analysis that supports the security of LWE. It further establishes boundaries for computational tractability in quantum systems, offering insights into the interplay between holography and quantum error correction mechanisms.

Abstract: The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem underlies modern lattice-based
cryptography and is assumed to be quantum hard. Recent results show that
estimating entanglement entropy is as hard as LWE, creating tension with
quantum gravity and AdS/CFT, where entropies are computed by extremal surface
areas. This suggests a paradoxical route to solving LWE by building holographic
duals and measuring extremal surfaces, seemingly an easy task. Three possible
resolutions arise: that AdS/CFT duality is intractable, that the
quantum-extended Church-Turing thesis (QECTT) fails, or that LWE is easier than
believed. We develop and analyze a fourth resolution: that estimating surface
areas with the precision required for entropy is itself computationally hard.
We construct two holographic quantum algorithms to formalize this. For entropy
differences of order N, we show that measuring Ryu-Takayanagi geodesic lengths
via heavy-field two-point functions needs exponentially many measurements in N,
even when the boundary state is efficiently preparable. For order one
corrections, we show that reconstructing the bulk covariance matrix and
extracting entropy requires exponential time in N. Although these tasks are
computationally intractable, we compare their efficiency with the Block
Korkine-Zolotarev lattice reduction algorithm for LWE. Our results reconcile
the tension with QECTT, showing that holographic entropy remains consistent
with quantum computational limits without requiring an intractable holographic
dictionary, and provide new insights into the quantum cryptanalysis of
lattice-based cryptography.

TL;DR: The paper compares atomic clocks and atom interferometers as gravitational wave detectors, highlighting interferometer advantages despite clock limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detection using atomic sensors is explored, comparing clocks and interferometers.

Method: The paper uses quantum mechanics and general relativity to model how gravitational waves affect atomic clocks and interferometers.

Result: Atom interferometers, due to their spatial superpositions, are more sensitive to gravitational waves than clocks. A composite interrogation method enhances both sensors.

Conclusion: Atomic interferometers are promising for mid-frequency gravitational wave detection, while clocks require advanced setups for similar sensitivity.

Abstract: Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks
and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical
gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on
interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated,
whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the
electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions,
while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive
particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective
potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work,
we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom
interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in
atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a
gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed
for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure
the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight
that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including
possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave.
While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial
optical clocks normally rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to
leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite
interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse
sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and
for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise
suppression.

Abstract: Isolators are commonly found in the amplification chain of microwave setups
to shield sensitive devices such as superconducting qubits from noise and
back-scattered signals. Conventional ferrite-based isolators are bulky, lossy
and rely on strong magnetic fields, which pose challenges for their
co-integration in large-scale superconducting devices. Here, we present a
magnetless isolator that overcomes these limitations with simulated
performances on par with the state-of-the-art. Using a dispersion-engineered
transmission line with a propagating adiabatic flux modulation, the simulated
device achieves more than 20 dB isolation over a broad frequency band ranging
from 4 to 8 GHz, which can be modified based on the device parameters.
Moreover, we propose a compact, low-loss, on-chip superconducting device that
shows promise against parameter variations and enables a scalable path for
co-integration with large-scale superconducting systems of the future.

Abstract: We investigate the nonrelativistic quantum dynamics of a spinless particle in
a screw-type spacetime endowed with two independent twist controls that
interpolate between a pure screw dislocation and a homogeneous twist. From the
induced spatial metric we build the covariant Schr\"odinger operator, separate
variables to obtain a single radial eigenproblem, and include a uniform
magnetic field and an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux by minimal coupling.
Analytically, we identify a clean separation between a global, AB-like
reindexing set by the screw parameter and a local, curvature-driven mixing
generated by the distributed twist. We derive the continuity equation and
closed expressions for the azimuthal and axial probability currents, establish
practical parameter scalings, and recover limiting benchmarks (AB, Landau, and
flat space). Numerically, a finite-difference Sturm-Liouville solver (with core
excision near the axis and Langer transform) resolves spectra, wave functions,
and currents. The results reveal AB periodicity and reindexing with the screw
parameter, Landau-fan trends, twist-induced level tilts and avoided crossings,
and a geometry-induced near-axis backflow of the axial current with negligible
weight in cross-section integrals. The framework maps the geometry and fields
directly onto measurable spectral shifts, interferometric phases, and
persistent-current signals.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate efficient interfacing of a large number of
atoms to an optical nanofiber using an optical lattice with tunable spacing
($0.88-1.5~\mu$m) [1] projected onto the nanofiber. The lattice beam and
reflections from the nanofiber yield trap potentials that provide tight
confinement in all motional degrees of freedom $\approx 220$ nm above the
nanofiber surface, enabling efficient atom-photon coupling. We achieved
trapping of $\approx1300$ atoms in periodic trap sites with a trap lifetime of
$\approx15$ ms. We also observe the effect of varied lattice period on the
atomic motional frequencies. Our new scheme is adaptable to other nanophotonic
cold-atom systems and provides a versatile and scalable platform for studying
photon-mediated long-range collective interactions. Our tunable
lattice-nanofiber system could be seamlessly integrated with optical tweezers,
allowing both the scalable atom-photon interface and individual single-atom
access, and its intrinsic connectivity to conventional fiber provides a
significant advantage towards quantum networks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bell's theorem demonstrates that any physical theory that is consistent with
the predictions of quantum mechanics, and which satisfies some apparently
innocuous assumptions, must violate the principle of local causality. It may
therefore be possible to maintain local causality by rejecting one of these
other assumptions instead. One possibility that has recently received
significant attention involves rejecting the principle of statistical
independence (SI). In this paper, we consider the frequency interpretation of
SI, which states that $\rho(\lambda) \approx \rho(\lambda | Z)$, where
$\rho(\lambda)$ is the relative frequency of an element of an ensemble being in
the state $\lambda$, and $Z$ is a label that separates the ensemble into
apparently randomly selected sub-ensembles. SI is violated when the
sub-ensemble frequency $\rho(\lambda | Z)$ fails to be representative of the
ensemble frequency $\rho(\lambda)$. We argue that physical theories that
systematically violate SI should all be understood as superdeterministic. This
perspective on SI sheds light on a number of issues that are being debated in
the superdeterminism literature, especially concerning its scope and
philosophical consequences. Regarding scope, we argue that superdeterministic
theories fall into three categories, deterministic theories with fine-tuned
initial conditions, fluke theories, and nomic exclusion theories. We also argue
that retrocausal and invariant set theories need not violate SI, which is
contrary to how they are normally presented. Regarding philosophical
implications, we argue that superdeterminism is incompatible with free will
according to some prominent compatibilist accounts. We also argue that although
superdeterminism is conspiratorial, it is not unscientific, but pre-scientific.

Conclusion: 首次成功构建了一个实时探他量子态收缩和 decoherence 的实验框架，为量子力学基础研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel method for probing quantum state collapse and decoherence
in real time using a mechanism we term the superposition trap. This approach
exploits the continuity equation in quantum mechanics to engineer a
configuration that spatially confines only coherent superpositions, while
allowing decohered or collapsed states to escape. By monitoring this leakage,
the dynamics of collapse processes-whether environmentally induced or intrinsic
to objective collapse models-can be experimentally accessed without disturbing
the coherent evolution itself. We outline a concrete implementation using an
atom interferometer with strontium atoms, where internal-state-selective
operations enable physical separation of collapsed components. This technique
offers a new experimental avenue to test collapse models, measure decoherence
rates, and investigate the quantum-to-classical transition.

Conclusion: 综合上述分析可知，该方法在消除量子环境相关性、维持系统精确度的同时，还具有较高的实际应用潜在。该研究为量子系统保护提供了一种有效且实用的方法。

Abstract: A quantum system may undergo undesired dynamics if it is already correlated
with its environment before global unitary evolution takes place. To mitigate
these effects, we apply local operations on the system of interest prior to the
global evolution. This ensures that a specific dynamics-matching condition is
satisfied - namely, that the system's dynamics can be U-generated starting from
an initial product state. We review two strategies for achieving this: local
measurements and local unitaries. For each, we outline their respective
advantages and disadvantages and provide examples illustrating when the
dynamics-matching condition can be satisfied. Since most operations inevitably
alter the system's initial state, we optimize the fidelity between the original
system state and the post-operation state, ensuring the condition can be met
with minimal perturbation. Local measurements always guarantee that the system
dynamics can be U-generated from a product state, but this comes at the cost of
reduced fidelity. By contrast, local unitary transformations typically avoid
this loss of fidelity: in our numerical study of 402 cases, they succeeded in
nearly all instances, with a minimum fidelity of about 94.2%. We further
strengthen these results by showing that a single unitary operation can prevent
all non-completely positive quantum dynamics for a system and environment
undergoing time-dependent global evolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that a
general two-term Kraus channel - implementable with the addition of just one
qubit - can raise all fidelities to 1 across the 402 cases, while still
ensuring that the dynamics-matching condition is satisfied.

Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources, particularly photovoltaic
(PV) systems and electric vehicles (EVs), introduces significant uncertainty
and complexity into modern energy systems. This paper explores a novel approach
to address these challenges by formulating a stochastic optimization problem
that models the uncertain nature of PV power generation and the flexibility of
bi-directional EV charging. The problem is structured as a two-stage stochastic
program with recourse, enabling the system to make optimal day-ahead decisions
while incorporating corrective actions in real time based on actual PV output
and EV availability. Leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing, we
implement and solve the stochastic model using quantum algorithms,
demonstrating the potential of quantum-enhanced optimization for
high-dimensional and uncertainty-driven energy management problems. Our results
indicate that quantum computing can provide efficient and scalable solutions
for complex recourse problems in smart grid applications, particularly when
integrating variable renewable generation and flexible demand resources.

Conclusion:  hBN as a platform for entangled spin qubits is a promising tool for 2D quantum technologies.

Abstract: Entanglement is central to quantum science and technology. Atomic defects in
two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exciting prospects for
quantum sensing, with spatial resolution reaching 1 nm demonstrated using
scanning probe techniques. However, entangling qubits in vdW materials remains
elusive. Here we report room-temperature quantum entanglement between an
optically addressable electron spin and a strongly coupled $^{13}$C nuclear
spin in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We extend the electron spin coherence to
38 $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling, and create maximally entangled Bell states
with a fidelity up to 0.89. We further use the nuclear spin as a long-lived
quantum memory to enhance AC magnetic field sensing via correlation
spectroscopy. These results establish entangled spin qubits in hBN as a robust
platform for advanced quantum technologies based on 2D materials.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Erbium-doped silica fiber (EDF) offers a promising solution for fiber-based quantum networks due to its compatibility with the telecom band and existing infrastructure. The research experimentally measures the homogeneous linewidth of EDF's 4I13/2 <-> 4I15/2 transition using the 2PPE technique, achieving an effective linewidth of 8 kHz at 7mK, which is two orders of magnitude better than previous results at 700 mK. The study also models the temperature and magnetic field dependency of the linewidth and investigates spectral diffusion and decoherence effects using 3PPE, finding that TLS effects are suppressed below 100 mK.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum networking relies heavily on stable and high-quality optical fibers, and improving the coherence properties of erbium-doped fibers is crucial for reliable quantum communication systems. This research provides significant insights into optimizing EDF for practical applications.

Method: The researchers used the two-pulse photon-echo (2PPE) technique to measure the homogeneous linewidth of the 4I13/2 <-> 4I15/2 transition in EDF under varying magnetic fields and temperatures. Additional experiments with the three-pulse photon-echo (3PPE) technique were conducted to study spectral diffusion and decoherence processes, providing a comprehensive model of the temperature and magnetic field dependencies.

Result: The study achieved an effective homogeneous linewidth of approximately 8 kHz at 7mK, surpassing previous results by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the results indicate that TLS effects are significantly suppressed at sufficiently low temperatures, below approximately 100 mK.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates that EDF can achieve high-quality optical properties suitable for quantum networks when operated at sufficiently low temperatures. The findings contribute to the development of stable and reliable quantum communication systems based on EDF.

Abstract: Erbium-doped solids are promising candidates for fiber-based quantum networks
due to their emission wavelength, which aligns with the telecom band over which
optical fibers exhibit minimal loss. Among these, erbium-doped silica fiber
(EDF) stands out for its availability, ease of use, and seamless integration
with existing fiber-optic infrastructure. In this work, using the two-pulse
photon-echo (2PPE) technique, we measured the homogeneous linewidth of the
4I13/2 <-> 4I15/2 optical transition under varying magnetic fields and
temperatures. We observed an effective homogeneous linewidth of approximately 8
kHz at approximately 7mK at an optimal magnetic field of 0.09 T, representing
over two orders of magnitude improvement compared to earlier reports measured
at T = 700 mK. We also present a comprehensive model for the combined magnetic
field and temperature dependency of the effective homogeneous linewidth.
Additionally, we employed three-pulse photon-echo (3PPE) measurements to
investigate spectral diffusion and decoherence processes, and conclude that
Two-Level System (TLS) effects are significantly suppressed at sufficiently low
temperatures, below approximately 100 mK.

TL;DR: TQC uses rotation sequences of anticoherent k-planes for noise-tolerant quantum gate construction. The paper demonstrates generalized Toffoli gates using k-planes of spin systems with s ≥ k + 1, and a Hadamard gate for a 3-qubit system using a spin-s=15 8-plane. A universal quantum computing scheme for 3-qubit systems based on Hadamard + Toffoli gates is proposed. This construction is robust against noise due to inherent reparametrization invariance and immunity to large deformations of the path in parameter space.

Conclusion: The work advances toponomic quantum computing by providing noise-tolerant quantum gates and a robust universal computing scheme for 3-qubit systems, highlighting potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Toponomic quantum computing (TQC) employs rotation sequences of anticoherent
$k$-planes to construct noise-tolerant quantum gates. In this work, we
demonstrate the implementation of generalized Toffoli gates, using $k$-planes
of spin systems with $s \geq k + 1$, and of the Hadamard gate for a 3-qubit
system, using a spin $s \!= \! 15$ 8-plane. We propose a universal quantum
computing scheme for 3-qubit systems (via Hadamard + Toffoli gates) based on

robustness against noise: apart from reparametrization invariance, our scheme
is characterized by immunity to arbitrarily large deformations of the path in

### [161] [Ultrafast Single-Qubit Gates in the Diabatic Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23467)
*Deniz Türkpençe,Selçuk Çakmak*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Superconducting quantum processors implement logic gates using microwave control techniques. Gate durations are critical for fault tolerance, so reducing them is important. This paper presents a model for single qubit gates in two regimes: adiabatic where rotating wave approximation (RWA) holds, and diabatic where RWA doesn't. Results show that in the diabatic regime, ultrashort pulses can achieve high fidelity, potentially enabling faster quantum logic without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance quantum computing by improving the speed of quantum logic gates without compromising their accuracy, which is crucial for achieving fault tolerance in quantum processors.

Method: The paper models single qubit gates in both adiabatic and diabatic regimes using parameters typical of superconducting qubits. It investigates gate operations at ultrashort durations and evaluates the associated limitations and trade-offs.

Result: The results demonstrate that gates in the diabatic regime can achieve high fidelity with ultrashort control pulses, offering a promising approach to faster quantum logic under ideal conditions.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for advancing quantum computing by enabling faster quantum logic gates through optimized control pulse durations, maintaining high gate fidelities.

Abstract: Logic gates in superconducting quantum processors are implemented through
precise quantum control techniques in the microwave regime. The choice of drive
frequency and other control parameters directly determines the duration of
quantum gate operations. Because current devices remain too noisy to reach
fault tolerance, reducing gate durations, and thereby the overall circuit
depth, is of critical importance. In this work, we present a model of single
qubit gate execution in both the adiabatic regime, where the rotating wave
approximation (RWA) is valid, and the diabatic regime, where the RWA no longer
applies. Using parameters representative of superconducting qubits, we
investigate how gates can be driven at durations well below conventional
timescales, and we examine the associated limitations, performance trade offs.
The results demonstrate that ultrashort control pulses in the diabatic regime
can achieve fidelities comparable to those obtained under standard RWA
conditions, offering a possible route to faster quantum logic without
sacrificing accuracy under idealized conditions.

*Yujun Choi,Hruday Mallubhotla,Mark Friesen,Susan N. Coppersmith,Robert Joynt*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Spin qubits in semiconductor devices are affected by charge noise with a power-law spectrum, which can be inferred using two-level fluctuating electric dipole systems (TLS). The inference of TLS parameters is not uniquely determined due to insufficient data, requiring qualitative methods or Bayesian approaches for analyzing TLS configurations. A Brier score can be used to assess the effectiveness of noise-measurement setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating charge noise in spin qubits is crucial for high-fidelity operations in semiconductor devices. The use of TLS as a means to characterize and infer noise sources provides a promising approach, but the challenge lies in uniquely determining TLS parameters given limited data.

Method: Two approaches are described: a qualitative method based on analytic calculations and simulations of small model systems, and a Bayesian computation that assigns probabilities to candidate dipole configurations. The Bayesian approach is more suitable for detailed data analysis.

Result: The study demonstrates that TLS parameters cannot be uniquely determined with the current data, and proposes using a Brier score to evaluate the effectiveness of noise-measurement setups. The analytical and computational Bayesian methods provide constraints on TLS properties without fixing them uniquely.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for further research to improve the ability to infer TLS parameters from experimental data, potentially through more advanced computational methods or additional experimental techniques.

Abstract: Charge noise with a power-law spectrum poses a significant challenge to
high-fidelity operation of spin qubits in semiconductor devices. Recently,
considerable experimental work characterized this noise using qubits as
spectrometers. It apparently arises from a collection of two-level fluctuating
electric dipole systems (TLS). This suggests using the data to infer the
positions, orientations, and other physical characteristics of the TLS. We
identify a fundamental difficulty in this program: the inference of the TLS
parameters is strongly undetermined, since the quantity of data is not
sufficient to fix them uniquely. We describe two approaches to deal with this
situation. The first approach is a qualitative method based on analytic
calculations and simulations of small model systems that recognizes certain
patterns. The second approach, more appropriate for detailed data analysis, is
a Bayesian computation that assigns probabilities to candidate dipole
configurations. We propose that the Brier score, a measure of confidence in the
probabilities, can be used as a quantitative tool to judge the efficacy of
experimental noise-measurement setups. Together, the analytical and
computational Bayesian methods constrain, but do not fix, the density, the
positions, the orientations, and the strengths of the dipole noise sources.

*Zhilong Liu,Ying Li,Zehua Tian,Jieci Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Black holes act as quantum information scramblers, and their dynamics can be modeled using curved spacetime analogues like position-dependent XY spin chains. By studying how scrambles affect quantum batteries, the research shows that intentional engineering of scrambling parameters can significantly enhance maximum stored energy and peak charging power in quench charging protocols. The study finds that the optimal charging time decreases with stronger scrambling parameters, suggesting that faster charging is achieved through enhanced scrambling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to explore the potential applications of black hole-like quantum systems in real-world technologies such as quantum batteries. By mimicking black hole scrambling properties, the researchers aim to optimize energy storage and charging processes.

Method: The method involves using curved spacetime analogues, specifically position-dependent XY spin chains, to model black hole-like quantum systems. The researchers then analyze the dynamics under controlled quenches to investigate how scrambling parameters affect the charging protocols. Techniques such as analyzing scrambling times, entropy calculations, and charging protocols are used.

Result: The results demonstrate that intentional engineering of scrambling parameters can significantly enhance both the maximum stored energy ($E_{	ext{max}}$) and peak charging power ($P_{	ext{max}}$) in the quench charging protocol. The optimal charging time ($	au_*$) is found to be almost independent of the initial horizon parameter ($x_{h0}$), but it decreases monotonically with the increase in the horizon parameter ($x_{ht}$) after the quench. This suggests that stronger scrambling parameters allow for faster charging through spacetime-mimicking dynamics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the design of quantum batteries and energy storage systems can benefit from the insights from black hole-like quantum systems. The findings suggest that enhanced scrambling through controlled parameters can lead to more efficient energy storage and faster charging protocols, potentially opening new avenues in quantum technologies and energy storage systems.

Abstract: Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a
phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as
position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are
governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system
size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we
explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches
of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally
engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters
could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak
charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. The optimal charging
time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon
parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench
horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power
operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} > x_{h0}$,
demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling
dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to generate squeezed states of magnons in a cavity-qubit hybrid system by engineering an effective Rabi-type interaction. By adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, the system can achieve magnon squeezing through parametric amplification-like interactions near a critical point leading to quantum correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum magnonics is advancing, with particular interest in nonclassical magnon states like squeezed states. Developing methods to prepare such states in controlled experiments is a key challenge in the field.

Method: The authors propose using a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system. They adiabatically eliminate the cavity mode, driving the qubit with two microwave fields to induce an effective Rabi-type interaction. Magnon squeezing is achieved near a critical point associated with a ground-state superradiant phase transition, facilitated by magnon parametric amplification.

Result: The study demonstrates that using current experimental parameters, a moderate degree of magnon squeezing can be achieved. The effects of dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on squeezing are further analyzed, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's limitations and potential.

Conclusion: This work opens up new avenues for generating nonclassical magnon states, which is essential for advancing quantum magnonics and potential applications in quantum information processing technologies.

Abstract: Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of
quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a
hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type
magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the
cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the
driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the
system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant
phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like
interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further
analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the
magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can
be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.

fault-tolerant rotation gates, state distillation or gate synthesis is
typically employed. However, the overhead of these schemes scales rapidly with
increasing Clifford hierarchy levels and required fidelity, limiting their use
in large-scale quantum algorithms. In this letter, we propose a method termed
multi-level transversal injection (MLTI) for preparing rotation states at
arbitrary Clifford hierarchy levels, which achieves high fidelity while
significantly reducing overhead compared to previous methods. Unlike the linear
cost scaling of state distillation, the overhead of MLTI drops with Clifford
hierarchy levels and then plateaus at higher levels, slashing the required
space-time volume by up to several orders of magnitude. Additionally, we
introduce a method for eliminating the off-diagonal terms of rotation states
without extra overhead, unifying the metrics of infidelity and trace distance.
These results render the overhead for high-precision rotation gates no longer
prohibitive, and thus bring the broad adoption of large-scale quantum
algorithms a critical step closer to reality.

### [166] [Quantum Resonance Beyond Direct Measurement: Insights from Weak Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23685)
*Daiki Ueda,Izumi Tsutsui*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Aharonov's weak value amplification using weak measurements offers a precise method to measure physical parameters. This approach is connected to quantum resonance phenomena like the Rabi and Ramsey resonances. The technique of indirect weak measurement, commonly used in weak value studies, is shown to be equivalent to direct measurement in certain cases. By synthesizing these methods into a unified framework, researchers can systematically compare measurement accuracies. This framework helps explain why Ramsey resonances provide higher precision in weak value amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving measurement techniques in quantum mechanics is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and understanding quantum systems. The connection between weak measurement methods and quantum resonances offers a promising avenue for enhancing precision in weak value amplification.

Method: The paper introduces a unified framework integrating direct and indirect weak measurements. It applies this framework to compare the precision of Ramsey resonances with those of direct weak measurements, specifically in the context of weak value amplification.

Result: The study demonstrates that Ramsey resonances yield higher precision than direct weak measurements in the context of weak value amplification. This result highlights the advantages of using indirect weak measurement schemes in certain quantum measurement scenarios.

Conclusion: By establishing a connection between direct and indirect weak measurements, the paper provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing and optimizing measurement precision in quantum systems. This work not only bridges theoretical concepts but also offers practical insights for improving measurement techniques in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Aharonov's weak value amplification realized via weak measurement provides a
versatile means to measure physical parameters with high accuracy, similar to
quantum resonance epitomized by the Rabi and Ramsey resonances. The similarity
between the two is not accidental: in fact, these two methods of precision
measurement have recently been shown to be interconnected for the particular
case of direct weak measurement. Here we show that this connection also holds
in the case of indirect weak measurement, which is the standard scheme used
mostly for studies of weak value amplification. We present a unified framework
of weak measurements in which direct measurement appears as a special case of
indirect measurement. This allows us to compare the measurement precision of
different methods on a common basis, as demonstrated explicitly for the Rabi
and Ramsey resonances, showing how the precision of the latter surpasses that
of the former in the context of weak value amplification.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Silicon spin qubits have potential in scalable quantum computing due to their compatibility and coherence, but challenges like crosstalk and donor placement limit their scalability. A scalable cluster architecture and control protocol have been developed to address these issues, achieving high-fidelity multi-qubit gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As quantum computing grows, scalability and reliability of quantum bits become crucial. Silimidate shows promise but needs overcoming technical challenges.

Method: The approach involves designing a cluster architecture, analyzing crosstalk errors, and optimizing control protocols. Experiments on nuclear spin qubits in clusters demonstrate intra- and inter-cluster gate fidelities.

Result: The scalable scheme resolves crosstalk and improves gate fidelities, supporting large-scale quantum processors. This advancement brings quantum computing closer to practical applications.

Conclusion: The work paves the way for robust, large-scale spin-based quantum processors by overcoming key technical limitations.

Abstract: Significant advances in silicon spin qubits highlight the potential of
silicon quantum dots for scalable quantum computing, given their compatibility
with industrial fabrication and long coherence times. In particular, phosphorus
(P)-doped spin qubits possess excellent coherence and have demonstrated
high-fidelity two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9%. However, scaling P-donor systems
is challenging due to crosstalk caused by the uniformity of individual P donors
and the low tolerance for imprecise atomic placement. Stochastic placement can
lead to multiple donors located within a small region (diameter <3 nm), forming
a so-called donor cluster. Notably, in cluster-based systems, high-fidelity
multi-qubit quantum gates and all-to-all connectivity have recently been
demonstrated experimentally on nuclear spin qubits. In this work, we propose a
scalable cluster-array architecture for nuclear spin qubits and a corresponding
control protocol. We analyze crosstalk-induced errors, a major error source,
during primitive operations under various parameters, showing that they can be
suppressed through device design and control optimization. We evaluate the
fidelities of intra- and inter-cluster multi-qubit gates between nuclear spins,
confirming the feasibility of our architecture and establishing design
requirements and parameter targets. The local all-to-all connectivity within
clusters provides unique flexibility for quantum error correction. Our scalable
scheme provides a path toward large-scale spin-based quantum processors.

Abstract: Quantum error detection is essential in realizing large-scale universal
quantum computation, especially for quantum error correction (QEC). However,
key elements for FTQC have yet to be realized in silicon qubits. Here, we
demonstrate quantum error detection on a donor-based silicon quantum processor
comprising four-nuclear spin qubits and one electron spin as an auxiliary
qubit. The entanglement capability of this system is validated through the
establishment of two-qubit Bell state entanglement between the nuclear spins
and the generation of a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state,
achieving a GHZ state fidelity of 88.5(2.3)%. Furthermore, by executing a
four-qubit error detection circuit with the stabilizers, we successfully detect
arbitrary single-qubit errors. The encoded Bell state entanglement information
is recovered by performing the Pauli-frame update (PFU) via postprocessing.
Based on the detected errors, we identify strongly biased noise in our system.
Our results mark a significant advance toward FTQC in silicon spin qubits.

Abstract: Topological boundary states exhibit distinctive properties, including
unidirectional propagation and noise robustness, which hold significant

Here, we demonstrate the implementation of non-Abelian quantum interference and
entanglement generation, protected by dual symmetries (time-independent

topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is
selected by the braiding sequence. We then extend this to two particles,
observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially

Abstract: Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important
technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels,
ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for
process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and
limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular,
sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while
emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure
conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To
close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor
based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We
achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting
in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside
sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing
fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by
ultralow torque noise.

Conclusion: Nth-root gates effectively leverage quantum coherence to improve thermodynamic performance.

Abstract: Nth-root gates allow for a paced application of two-qubit operations. We
apply them in quantum thermodynamic protocols for operating a quantum heat

maximum work production and related efficiency. Our results show that for all
circuits considered and most regions of initial parameter space, quantum
coherence of one of the qubits strongly increases the maximum work production
and improves the system's performance as a quantum heat engine. In such
circuits, coherence is initially imprinted into one of the qubits, improving
the overall maximum extractable work. Work gets generated with 84% to 100%
efficiency. Further, we uncover a strong linear correlation between work
production and many-body correlations in the working medium generated by these
gates.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Inferring nonlinear features of quantum states is fundamentally important
across quantum information science, but remains challenging due to the
intrinsic linearity of quantum mechanics. It is widely recognized that quantum
memory and coherent operations help avoid exponential sample complexity, by
mapping nonlinear properties onto linear observables over multiple copies of
the target state. In this work, we prove that such a conversion is not only
sufficient but also necessary. Specifically, we prove that the estimation of
$\mathrm{tr}(\rho^{k} O)$ for a broad class of observables $O$ is exponentially
hard for any protocol restricted to $(k-1)$-replica joint measurements, whereas
access to one additional replica reduces the complexity to a constant. These
results establish, for the first time, an exponential separation between
$(k-1)$- and $k$-replica protocols for any integer $k>2$, thereby introducing a
fine-grained hierarchy of replica-based quantum advantage and resolving an open
question in the literature. The technical core is a general
indistinguishability principle showing that any ensemble constructed from large
Haar random states via tensor products and mixtures is hard to distinguish from
its average. Leveraging this principle, we further prove that $k$-replica joint
measurements are also necessary for distinguishing rank-$k$ density matrices
from rank-$(k-1)$ ones. Overall, our work delineates sharp boundaries on the
power of joint measurements, highlighting resource-complexity trade-offs in
quantum learning theory and deepening the understanding of quantum mechanics'
intrinsic linearity.

Motivation: 研究粒子在不同维度空间中的零能态退化性有助于理解量子力学中的拓扑效应和能隙。
零能态的退化性在材料科学和量子计算中有重要应用。
通过比较一维和二维的情况，可以更深入地理解这些效应的根源。
此外，研究不同的维数空间中的物理行为也是量子力学中的一个重要主题。

Method: 在二维情况中，Aharonov和Casher的能量零态是由一个标量势λ(x,y)唯一确定的。我们通过构建一维情况中的多个标量势族，证明了一维中存在无限多的零能态。

Result: 在二维空间中，零能态的退化性是有限的；而在一维空间中，由于存在无限多重的标量势族，导致零能态的退化性是无限的。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，空间维度对带电粒子零能态的退化性有显著影响。在二维空间中，零能态的退化性是有限的；在第一维度中，存在无限多的零能态。这可能揭示了不同维度系统中可能存在的广泛物理现象，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: In this note, we care to study the degeneracy of the zero modes for a
spin-$1/2$ charged particle in a one-dimensional space. We analyze the
arguments proposed by Aharonov and Casher in a two-dimensional space. In two
dimensions the zero energy states are constructed in terms on a scalar
potential $\lambda(x,y)$, which is uniquely determined. We show that in one
dimension it is possible the existence of an infinite family of the scalar
potentials. This family is determined by a quantum number $k$, which is
restricted by the relation $|k| < \frac{1}{2} \int dx B(x)$, where $B(x)$ is a
scalar field localized in a restricted region of the space. This implies that
the degeneracy of the zero energy states is infinite, which contrasts with the
two dimensional case in which the degeneracy is finite. Finally we apply our
results to a two dimensional case in which magnetic field have a translational
symmetry along a direction.

Abstract: In the present paper, a novel framework to detect genuine multipartite
entanglement (GME) has been presented by computing correlations in mutually
unbiased bases (MUBs). It has been shown that correlation obtained by measuring
in MUBs of all biseparable multipartite states satisfy a bound, whereas GME
states violate it. Thus, the presented framework turns out to be a sufficient
criterion to detect entanglement in many body scenario. The methodology paves a
suitable way to demonstrate certification of different classes of tripartite
and quadripartite GME states. In addition to its operational universality,
correlation obtained by measuring in MUBs is shown to be juxtaposed with few
well known genuine tripartite and quadripartite entanglement measures.

TL;DR: Gate-based PiQC outperforms SPSA in minimizing the HF error for stretched bonds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparative study between open-loop control for parametrized quantum circuits and VQE.

Method: Adaptation and benchmarking of Gate-based PiQC (GB-PiQC) against VQE using SPSA for ground state preparation.

Result: GB-PiQC shows better robustness than SPSA to changes in molecular bond distances, especially at stretched lengths.

Conclusion: GB-PiQC is more effective for quantum control and optimization in open quantum systems compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The Path integral Quantum Control (PiQC) algorithm was recently introduced by
Villanueva et al. (2025) as a new approach for computing optimal controls in
open and closed quantum systems. Originally proposed for pulse-based quantum
control, PiQC estimates optimal controls through global averages over quantum
trajectories. In this work, we adapt the PiQC algorithm to optimize
parametrized quantum circuits by showing that the quantum circuit can be
randomized using a continuous dynamics governed by a stochastic Schr\"odinger
equation that is compatible with the path integral control framework. In this
adaptation, the circuit parameters become the controls to be optimized within
PiQC. We refer to this instance of PiQC as the Gate-based PiQC (GB-PiQC)
algorithm. We apply GB-PiQC for ground state preparation of electronic
structure problems. We benchmark the gate-based and pulse-based versions of
PiQC against the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which is optimized
using the common Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA)
optimizer, on a set of standard molecular Hamiltonians: H2, LiH, BeH2, and H4,
mapped to 2-, 4-, 6-, and 6-qubit systems, respectively. For each molecule, the
benchmark is implemented at different bond distances, after performing a
hyperparameter tuning of each algorithm at a fixed bond distance near the
equilibrium geometry. We find that both PiQC algorithms exhibit greater
robustness than SPSA to variations in the target Hamiltonian induced by changes
in molecular bond distances. Furthermore, PiQC algorithms also achieve superior
performance compared to SPSA in most instances, particularly at stretched bond
lengths, where the Hartree-Fock solution becomes less accurate and its error
grows relative to equilibrium.

Abstract: There is a strong interest in finding challenging instances of NP-hard

of near-term NISQ devices, it is moreover useful if these instances are small.
In this work, we identify two graph families ($|V|<1000$) on which the
Goemans-Williamson algorithm for approximating the Max-Cut achieves at most a
0.912-approximation. We further show that, in comparison, a recent quantum
algorithm, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (depth $p=1$), is a
0.592-approximation on Karloff instances in the limit ($n \to \infty$), and is
at best a $0.894$-approximation on a family of strongly-regular graphs. We
further explore construction of challenging instances computationally by
perturbing edge weights, which may be of independent interest, and include
these in the CI-QuBe github repository.

Motivation: 开发高效的量子误差校正码对于实现实际噪声环境下的量子优势至关重要，而现有的Floquet码需要处理复杂的 syndrome，导致解码过程繁琐。

Method: 我们通过结合双曲色和Floquet码，提出了一种新编码方案，该方案通过六步测距实现轻量级错误检测和快速修复，解码时间可与物理量子位数近乎线性缩放。

Result: HCF编码具有以下优点：（1）每个测距的权重仅为2；（2）编码效率为有限值；（3）代码距离与log n成正比；（4）单故障事件最多影响两个检测器；（5）解码时间可与n近乎线性缩放。

Conclusion: HCF编码是一种高效的原生量子码，能够克服现有Floquet码在解码复杂度方面的局限性。

Abstract: Quantum error correction would be a primitive for demonstrating quantum
advantage in a realistic noisy environment. Floquet codes are a class of
dynamically generated, stabilizer-based codes in which low-weight parity
measurements are applied in a time-periodic schedule. Furthermore, for several
Floquet codes, the encoding rate becomes finite even for an infinitely large
qubit number. However, despite these advantageous properties, existing Floquet
codes require handling more intricate, often hypergraph-structured syndromes
from the decoding perspective, which makes decoding comparatively demanding. We
give a concrete method for solving this issue by proposing hyperbolic color
Floquet (HCF) code. To this end, we simultaneously take advantage of hyperbolic
Floquet and Floquet color codes. Parity measurements in our code consist of the
repetitions of six-step measurements on (semi-)hyperbolic three-colorable
tilings. Since each step just measures $X \otimes X$ or $Z \otimes Z$, our code
on the regular $\{8,3\}$ lattice has the following three advantages: (i) parity
measurements are weight-2, (ii) for the numbers $k$ and $n$ of logical and
physical qubits, respectively, the encoding rate is finite, i.e., $\lim_{n \to
\infty} k/n = 1/8$, and (iii) the code distance is proportional to $\log n$.
From the above property, each single-fault event generally affects at most two
detectors, which implies ``graph-edge'' syndromes, and hence decoding with a
minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder is efficient and virtually
scales near-linearly in the number of physical qubits $n$. This is a stark
contrast to several known Floquet codes because their parity measurements
repeat the measurements of $X\!\otimes\!X$, $Y\!\otimes\!Y$, and
$Z\!\otimes\!Z$, and thus the syndromes are represented as a hypergraph, which
basically requires decoders with longer decoding time.

Abstract: Topological orders can be understood as spontaneous symmetry breaking of
higher-form symmetries. In the non-Abelian case, the broken higher-form
symmetries are notably non-invertible. In this work, we extend this framework
to mixed states, where symmetries can be either strong or weak. In particular,
we investigate the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) of
non-invertible higher-form symmetries in non-Abelian Kitaev's quantum double
models under decoherence. We further show that the resulting decohered quantum
double mixed states form a locally indistinguishable set, which also
constitutes an information convex set. Importantly, we emphasize that the
dimension of this convex set equals the ground-state degeneracy of the
corresponding pure state, highlighting that the quantum information encoded in
the ground-state subspace is degraded into classical information captured by
the convex set of decohered density matrices.

Abstract: We introduce a feasible protocol for generating non-Gaussian (nG) states via
postselected von Neumann measurement for continuous-variable quantum
information processing. The method uses a two-level system coupled to a
Gaussian pointer state through an observable $A$ with $A^{2}=\mathbb{I}$. By
operating beyond the weak-coupling regime and selecting different pointer
states -- squeezed, coherent, or vacuum -- allows generation of a wide range of
nG states, including squeezed cat states, two-mode entangled cat states,
approximate Bell states, and a continuum of intermediate nG states with
considerable success probabilities. The properties of these states are widely
tunable via the postselection-induced weak value and the measurement
interaction strength. We characterize the non-Gaussianity via Wigner function
negativities and quantify entanglement using linear entropy and concurrence.
The protocol offers a scalable route to high-purity nG state engineering.

Motivation: Understanding noise in quantum computations is essential for reliable algorithm execution and hardware development.

Method: The study implemented QAOA on IBM's Q System One using both simulated and actual quantum hardware, applying various optimization techniques and error correction methods.

Result: The experiments revealed that certain optimization strategies and error mitigation techniques significantly reduce noise impacts on QAOA, though challenges remain in fully robust execution.

Conclusion: This work provides insights for optimizing QAOA on real quantum hardware, emphasizing the importance of error management in practical applications.

Abstract: Running quantum circuits on quantum computers does not always generate
"clean" results, unlike on a simulator, as noise plays a significant role in
any quantum device. To explore this, we experimented with the Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on quantum simulators and real
quantum hardware. QAOA is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and requires
hundreds or thousands of independent executions of the quantum circuit for
optimization, which typically goes beyond the publicly available resources for
quantum computing. We were granted access to the IBM Quantum System One at the
Cleveland Clinic, the first on-premises IBM system in the U.S. This paper
explores different optimization methods, techniques, error mitigation methods,
and QAOA variants to observe how they react to quantum noise differently, which
is helpful for other researchers to understand the complexities of running QAOA
on real quantum hardware and the challenges faced in dealing with noise.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the continuous-wave Detection and Ranging technology, simultaneous and
accurate range and velocity measurements of an unknown target are typically
achieved using a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) with a heterodyne
receiver. The high time-bandwidth product of the FMCW waveform facilitates the
optimization and high-precision of these measurements while maintaining low
transmission power. Despite recent efforts to develop the quantum counterpart
of this technology, a quantum protocol for FMCW that enhances measurement
precision in lossy channels with background noise has yet to be established.
Here, we propose a quantum illumination protocol for FMCW technology that
utilizes sum frequency generation and an entangled light source with low
transmission power. This protocol demonstrates a 3 dB enhancement in the
precision limit for high-loss channels compared to classical approaches,
independent of the background noise level. This precision limit is achieved
through quantum heterodyne detection (QHD), followed by signal processing.
Moreover, in classical approaches, QHD is only optimal in high-loss channels
when strong background noise is present. In weak background noise scenarios,
our protocol can further provides precision enhancements up to 6 dB over
classical methods with QHD.

Motivation: Characterizing quantum devices is crucial for gaining insights into experimental settings while managing uncertainty.

Method: Combines known system dynamics with unknown transformations using machine learning, specifically Bayesian Neural Networks and binary measurement outcomes for inference.

Result: The model shows improved prediction performance by capturing the distribution of observed data more effectively.

Conclusion: The probabilistic Graybox model offers a flexible and efficient tool for characterizing quantum devices with uncertainty estimation, enhancing decision-making in research.

Abstract: While the Graybox characterization method allows for implicit noise models
and is platform-agnostic, the method lacks uncertainty quantification.
Characterization of quantum devices is a crucial process that enables
researchers to gain insight from experimental settings. Graybox
characterization combines known system dynamics with unknown transformations,
where the latter is modeled using machine learning. Prediction uncertainty
helps researchers make informed decisions. It allows valuable insights from the
devices without overconfidence. We therefore develop a probabilistic Graybox
characterization model using probabilistic machine learning, specifically
Bayesian Neural Networks, and utilize binary measurement outcomes directly for
inference. With stochastic noise in a quantum device, we analyze statistical
properties of the measurement data. Our results show that the model's
prediction performance solely depends on its ability to capture the expected
value of the true expectation value. Our proposed probabilistic Graybox model
outperforms the original model by up to 1.9 times in capturing the distribution
of observed data. We expect that our results will serve as an additional tool
for characterizing quantum devices with uncertainty estimation, as they provide
a flexible choice that can be utilized even without extensive prior knowledge
of the noise model of the devices.

Abstract: Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum
information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's
quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing
electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for
counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely
incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected
photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or
temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum
detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array
(FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features
of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully
integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard
multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and
feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1)
reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems;
2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3)
efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate
feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we
deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize
noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling
critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information
processing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop an algebraic and information-theoretic framework to characterize
symmetry breaking of generalized, non-invertible symmetries in two spatial
dimensions. The reduction of symmetry is modeled within subfactor theory, where
condensable Frobenius algebras play the role of subgroups in the categorical
setting. This perspective naturally connects to the description of anyon
condensation in topological phases of matter. Central to our approach are
coarse-graining maps, or conditional expectations, which act as quantum
channels projecting observables from a phase with higher symmetry onto one
where the symmetry is partially or completely broken by condensation. By
employing relative entropy as an entropic order parameter, we quantify the
information loss induced by condensation and establish a universal bound
governed by the Jones index, equal to the quantum dimension of the condensate.
We illustrate the framework through explicit examples, including the toric
code, abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the representation category
Rep($S_3$), and show how dualities give rise to equivalence classes of
condensation patterns. Our results forge new connections between operator
algebras, tensor category theory, and quantum information in the study of
generalized symmetries.

Abstract: We introduce a basis-restricted variant of the Quantum-k-SAT problem, in

respect to a natural gateset. Our construction is based on the Feynman-Kitaev

interleaves two clocks in the standard and Hadamard bases. In light of the
central role played by CSS codes and the uncertainty principle in the proof of
the NLTS theorem of Anshu, Breuckmann, and Nirkhe (STOC '23), we hope that the
CSS-like structure of our Hamiltonians will make them useful for progress
towards a quantum PCP theorem.

Conclusion: 优化多层级管道架构有助于加速实用型量子计算机的发展。

Abstract: Practical quantum computation requires high-fidelity instruction executions
on qubits. Among them, Clifford instructions are relatively easy to perform,
while non-Clifford instructions require the use of magic states. This makes
magic state distillation a central procedure in fault-tolerant quantum
computing. A magic state distillation factory consumes many low-fidelity input
magic states and produces fewer, higher-fidelity states. To reach high
fidelities, multiple distillation factories are typically chained together into
a multi-level pipeline, consuming significant quantum computational resources.
Our work optimizes the resource usage of distillation pipelines by introducing
a novel dynamic pipeline architecture. Observing that distillation pipelines
consume magic states in a burst-then-steady pattern, we develop dynamic factory
scheduling and resource allocation techniques that go beyond existing static
pipeline organizations. Dynamic pipelines reduce the qubit cost by 16%-70% for
large-scale quantum applications and achieve average reductions of 26%-37% in
qubit-time volume on generated distillation benchmarks compared to
state-of-the-art static architectures. By significantly reducing the resource
overhead of this building block, our work accelerates progress towards the
practical realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: Quantum repeaters incorporating quantum memory play a pivotal role in
mitigating loss in transmitted quantum information (photons) due to link
attenuation over a long-distance quantum communication network. However,
limited availability of available storage in such quantum repeaters and the
impact on the time spent within the memory unit presents a trade-off between
quantum information fidelity (a metric that quantifies the degree of similarity
between a pair of quantum states) and qubit transmission rate. Thus, effective
management of storage time for qubits becomes a key consideration in multi-hop
quantum networks. To address these challenges, we propose Q-REACH, which
leverages queuing theory in caching networks to tune qubit transmission rate
while considering fidelity as the cost metric. Our contributions in this work
include (i) utilizing a method of repetition that encodes and broadcasts
multiple qubits through different quantum paths, (ii) analytically estimating
the time spent by these emitted qubits as a function of the number of paths and
repeaters, as well as memory units within a repeater, and (iii) formulating
optimization problem that leverages this analysis to correct the transmitted
logic qubit and select the optimum repetition rate at the transmitter.

Abstract: Quantum-correlated photon pairs are crucial resources for modern quantum
information science. Similarly, the reliable generation of nonclassical phonon
pairs is vital for advancing engineerable solid-state quantum devices and
hybrid quantum networks based on phonons. Here, we present a novel approach to
generate quantum-correlated phonon pairs in a suspended silicon microstructure
initialized in its motional ground state. By simultaneously implementing red-
and blue-detuned laser pulses, equivalent high-order optomechanical
nonlinearity--specifically, an effective optomechanical four-wave mixing
process--is achieved for generating a nonclassical phonon pair, which is then
read out via a subsequent red-detuned pulse. We demonstrate the nonclassical
nature of the generated phonon pair through the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality. Our experimentally observed phonon pair violates the classical
bound by more than 5 standard deviations and maintains a decoherence time of
132 ns. This work reveals novel quantum manipulation of phonon states enabled
by equivalent high-order optomechanical nonlinearity within a pulse scheme and
provides a valuable quantum resource for mechanical quantum computing.

*Prabhanjan Ananth,Aditya Gulati,Yao-Ting Lin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper shows that certain quantum cryptographic primitives, specifically QCCC bit commitments and QCCC key agreement, cannot be efficiently constructed from pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) using a black-box approach. The authors demonstrate that distinguishing identical and independent Haar random unitaries via separable channels is inherently difficult, which implies that PRUs alone are insufficient for these cryptographic tasks. This finding builds upon and improves previous work in learning theory and cryptography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work stems from the desire to understand the cryptographic strength and limitations of pseudorandom unitaries in the quantum realm. Since PRUs are considered weaker than one-way functions, it is crucial to delineate their capabilities and boundaries, particularly in constructing fundamental cryptographic primitives like bit commitments and key agreement.

Method: The authors employ techniques from quantum information theory and complexity theory. They analyze the problem by considering the distinguishability of identical versus independent Haar unitaries using separable channels. By establishing the difficulty of this task, they argue that PRUs cannot be used to construct the aforementioned cryptographic primitives efficiently.

Result: The key result of the paper is that QCCC bit commitments and QCCC key agreement cannot be constructed from pseudorandom unitaries in a black-box manner. This is achieved by demonstrating that it is hard to tell apart identical and independent Haar unitaries using separable channels, thereby highlighting the limitations of PRUs in cryptographic applications.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the understanding of the role and limitations of pseudorandom unitaries in quantum cryptography. It provides evidence that certain cryptographic primitives may indeed require stronger primitives than PRUs, aligning with the existing belief that PRUs are weaker than one-way functions. The findings are significant for the design and analysis of quantum cryptographic protocols, particularly those that rely on classical communication and may have applications in secure communication and computation.

Abstract: Pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), one of the key quantum pseudorandom notions,
are efficiently computable unitaries that are computationally indistinguishable
from Haar random unitaries. While there is evidence to believe that PRUs are
weaker than one-way functions, so far its relationship with other quantum
cryptographic primitives (that are plausibly weaker than one-way functions) has
not been fully established.
  In this work, we focus on quantum cryptographic primitives with classical
communication, referred to as QCCC primitives. Our main result shows that QCCC
bit commitments and QCCC key agreement, cannot be constructed from pseudorandom
unitaries in a black-box manner.
  Our core technical contribution is to show (in a variety of settings) the
difficulty of distinguishing identical versus independent Haar unitaries by
separable channels. Our result strictly improves upon prior works which studied
similar problems in the context of learning theory [Anshu, Landau, Liu, STOC
2022] and cryptography [Ananth, Gulati, Lin, TCC 2024].

epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning
of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in
as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic
complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and
polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from
different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time
correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band
kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include
excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy
states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To
verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and
reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a
detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay
between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for
boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and
shortening the radiative lifetimes.

captures the monitored dynamics beyond the average state. We prove the method
to be exact in the case of Gaussian theories and then extend it to the
interacting Sine-Gordon model. Although no longer exact in this framework, the

from an area-law to a logarithmic-law scaling.

Conclusion: Significant advancement in efficient numerical simulation of open quantum systems.

Abstract: Focusing on the real-time dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the
multidimensional Caldeira-Leggett model, several techniques are adopted in this
paper to reduce the spatial and temporal dimensionality, combined into an
efficient algorithm. From a spatial perspective, an equivalent formulation of
the Dyson series is presented. With the aid of a low-rank approximation, the
spatial dimensionality of open quantum system simulations is halved. From a
temporal perspective, the frozen Gaussian approximation is used to approximate
both the evolution operator and the interaction operator in the
multidimensional Caldeira-Leggett model. This reduces the high-dimensional
integrals to one- and two-dimensional integrals independent of the truncation
level of the Dyson series. Through these techniques, we design an efficient
algorithm whose validity is verified through several numerical experiments,
including a two-dimensional double slit simulation.

Abstract: This thesis studies the exploration and exploitation trade-off in online
learning of properties of quantum states using multi-armed bandits. Given
streaming access to an unknown quantum state, in each round we select an
observable from a set of actions to maximize its expectation value. Using past
information, we refine actions to minimize regret; the cumulative gap between
current reward and the maximum possible. We derive information-theoretic lower
bounds and optimal strategies with matching upper bounds, showing regret
typically scales as the square root of rounds. As an application, we reframe
quantum state tomography to both learn the state efficiently and minimize
measurement disturbance. For pure states and continuous actions, we achieve
polylogarithmic regret using a sample-optimal algorithm based on a weighted
online least squares estimator. The algorithm relies on the optimistic
principle and controls the eigenvalues of the design matrix. We also apply our
framework to quantum recommender systems and thermodynamic work extraction from
unknown states. In this last setting, our results demonstrate an exponential
advantage in work dissipation over tomography-based protocols.

Method: The study compares non-positive and positive measurements under different quantum encoding schemes, analyzing their performance in unitary and open-system encodings.

Result: Non-positive measurements show no advantage in unitary encoding but can be beneficial in open encoding under specific conditions. Positive measurements suffice for optimal precision in arbitrary open-system encodings.

Conclusion: The choice of measurements depends on the encoding scheme and the specific quantum system being studied.

Abstract: We investigate whether non-positive operator-valued measurements can be
beneficial for quantum metrology. For unitary encoding, we show that
non-positive measurements offer no advantage over positive ones. Going over to
open encoding, we find, however, that non-positive measurements can be
advantageous for certain cases, while it may mirror the unitary case - no
advantage over positive measurements - for others. For arbitrary open-system
encoding, we identify a sufficient condition under which positive measurements
suffice to achieve the best precision, and more resource-intensive non-positive
measurements offer no extra benefit.

### [199] [Reconstructing Quantum States and Expectations via Dynamical Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24636)
*Marco Peruzzo,Tommaso Grigoletto,Francesco Ticozzi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Dynamic quantum tomography is explored for general quantum dynamics, leveraging Krylov-based methods. A deterministic approach is developed for Markovian systems, alongside randomized methods to assess parametric dynamics. The limits of the methods are tested by comparing unitary and open quantum dynamics when only a single observable is available, and the set of reconstructible observables is characterized. Applications include a spin chain (with or without dissipation) and an electron-nuclear system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of quantum systems is a cornerstone of modern physics, requiring precise methods for state reconstruction. This work advances the field by introducing dynamic quantum tomography, which enhances state reconstruction techniques by incorporating system evolution prior to measurements.

Method: The approach employs Krylov-based methods for general quantum dynamics and develops deterministic and randomized techniques specifically for Markovian dynamics. The limits of these methods are assessed by comparing unitary and open quantum dynamics, and the set of observable expectations that can be reconstructed is characterized.

Result: A comprehensive framework for dynamic quantum tomography is established, which can be applied to a variety of quantum systems, including spin chains with or without dissipation and electron-nuclear systems.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust and versatile methodology for dynamic quantum tomography, significantly advancing our ability to probe and reconstruct quantum states in diverse dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: When the dynamics of a quantum system of interest is known, an
informationally-complete set of observables is not needed for state
reconstruction via tomographic techniques: letting the system evolve before
performing the measurement allows one to effectively extend the available ways
to probe the system. This idea leads to dynamical quantum tomography, whose
feasibility we characterize for general quantum dynamics using Krylov-based
methods. Specializing to Markovian ones, we also provide deterministic tests,
and randomized ones to effectively assess parametric dynamics. The limits of
the methods are explored comparing unitary and open dynamics when a single
observable is available, and the set of observables whose expectation can be
reconstructed from the available ones characterized. The framework is
illustrated with applications to a spin chain (with or without dissipation) and
an electron-nuclear system

Abstract: Interference is a powerful tool for measuring and control. In M\"ossbauer
science, interference effects are essential to most applications, due to the
coherent scattering nature. However, M\"ossbauer interferometry remains
challenging, due to stability requirements imposed by the short x-ray
wavelength. Here, we put forward a ``dark fringe'' interferometer with
vanishing transmission in the empty state, thereby facilitating sensitive
measurements. The relative interferometer phase can dynamically be tuned by
displacing a M\"ossbauer target. We experimentally demonstrate the tuning
capabilities of this interferometer by controlling the transmitted x-ray
intensity on nanosecond time scales. Then, we demonstrate sensitive
measurements by observing the propagation of impulsively launched sound waves
in the target over $\sim 10\,\mu s$. The interferometer concept opens avenues
towards polarization-sensitive phase measurements, the generation of coherent
multi-pulse sequences for controlling nuclear dynamics, and the implementation
of feedback loops to adaptively optimize the interferometer, thereby fueling
the further development of nuclear quantum optics.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the automated discovery of quantum circuit gadgets using reinforcement learning. The success of quantum error correction heavily relies on the effectiveness of the circuit-to-gate decomposition. While conventional decomposition methods exist, this work introduces an algorithm that can automatically identify new and effective gadgets through a directed graph representation of quantum circuits and automated search for recurring subgraphs. The algorithm was validated through simulation experiments, showing promising outcomes in improving circuit decomposition for quantum error correction. This work opens a new avenue for optimizing quantum circuit decomposition through automatic gadget discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction plays a crucial role in maintaining coherent quantum states despite environmental noise, and improving its performance is a key challenge. This paper addresses the gap in automated decomposition of quantum circuits into efficient gate-level implementations using reinforcement learning and graph theory.

Method: The paper proposes a novel algorithm that transforms quantum circuits into directed graphs, identifies recurring subgraphs (gadgets) using automated search, and evaluates their suitability for inclusion in RL-based agent actions. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through simulation experiments and comparisons with existing gadgets.

Result: The algorithm successfully discovered two new families of 4-qubit gadgets that outperformed a basline family discovered via manual domain expertise. Simulations also highlighted strengths and limitations of the found gadgets in terms of RL-based application to quantum error correction.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new method for automated discovery of quantum circuit gadgets that can enhance the performance of reinforcement learning-based quantum error correction. Although the algorithm works effectively in simulation, future work will address potential challenges in resource-intensive quantum circuit decomposition and scalability issues for larger quantum systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven itself as a powerful tool for the
discovery of quantum circuits and quantum protocols. We have recently shown
that including composite quantum gates -- referred to as ``gadgets'' -- in the
action space of RL agents substantially enhances the RL performance in the
context of quantum error correction. However, up to now the gadgets themselves
had to be constructed manually. In this paper, we suggest an algorithm for the
automated discovery of new gadgets and families of related gadgets. The
algorithm is based on the representation of quantum circuits as directed graphs
and an automated search for repeated subgraphs. The latter are identified as
gadgets. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, which allows us to
find two new gadget families suitable for RL. We compare the performance of
4-qubit gadgets taken from a previously known and a newly discovered family and
discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

Abstract: We present a general framework to model spontaneous emission in integrated
photonic structures by exploiting quantization of the electromagnetic field in
terms of asymptotic in/out modes. This approach allows for an efficient and
physically meaningful calculation of the emission rate into each radiative
channel of an arbitrary structure, without relying on approximations such as
Lorentzian lineshapes or point-like system-bath coupling. We show that with
this approach one can recover well-known results for dipole emission in
waveguides or ring resonators, and that such results can be easily extended to
include the effect of backscattering. Finally, as an application, we design a
tunable integrated single-photon source that enables full control over both the
emission rate and output mode. This flexibility makes our method particularly
well-suited for the design and analysis of integrated single-photon sources in
various material platforms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Due to its fast and robust characteristics, nonadiabatic geometric quantum
computation with various optimized techniques has received much attention.
However, these strategies either require precise pulse control or can only
mitigate partial systematic errors, hindering their experimental development.
Here, we propose a scheme for optimized composite nonadiabatic geometric
quantum gates (OCNGQGs), which can further enhance the gate performance of the
composite nonadiabatic geometric scheme. Specifically, by optimizing the path
parameter, our scheme effectively resists systematic errors in both directions,
i.e., Rabi frequency and detuning errors, while preserving the flexibility of
pulse shapes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our scheme offers superior
gate robustness against these two types of errors compared to conventional
schemes. Additionally, we propose to implement our scheme on superconducting
transmon qubits, where the numerical results show the robustness of universal
gates remaining evident within current technology. Therefore, our proposal
provides a promising approach to achieve robust quantum gates for future
scalable quantum computation.

Abstract: Regression is a cornerstone of statistics and machine learning, with
applications spanning science, engineering, and economics. While quantum
algorithms for regression have attracted considerable attention, most existing
work has focused on linear regression, leaving many more complex yet
practically important variants unexplored. In this work, we present a unified
quantum framework for accelerating a broad class of regression tasks --
including linear and multiple regression, Lasso, Ridge, Huber, $\ell_p$-, and
$\delta_p$-type regressions -- achieving up to a quadratic improvement in the
number of samples $m$ over the best classical algorithms. This speedup is
achieved by extending the recent classical breakthrough of Jambulapati et al.
(STOC'24) using several quantum techniques, including quantum leverage score
approximation (Apers &Gribling, 2024) and the preparation of many copies of a
quantum state (Hamoudi, 2022). For problems of dimension $n$, sparsity $r < n$,
and error parameter $\epsilon$, our algorithm solves the problem in
$\widetilde{O}(r\sqrt{mn}/\epsilon + \mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon))$ quantum
time, demonstrating both the applicability and the efficiency of quantum
computing in accelerating regression tasks.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the quantum decoding problem. It consists in recovering a
codeword given a superposition of noisy versions of this codeword. By measuring
the superposition, we get back to the classical decoding problem. It appears
for the first time in Chen, Liu and Zhandry's work showing a quantum advantage
for the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem for the $l_\infty$ norm. In a
recent paper, Chailloux and Tillich proved that when we have a noise following
a Bernoulli distribution, the quantum decoding problem can be solved in
polynomial time and is therefore easier than classical decoding for which the
best known algorithms have an exponential complexity. They also give an
information theoretic limit for the code rate at which this problem can be
solved which turns out to be above the Shannon limit.
  In this paper, we generalize the last result to all memoryless noise models.
We also show similar results in the rank metric case which corresponds to a
noise model which is not memoryless. We analyze the Pretty Good Measurement,
from which we derive an information theoretic limit for this problem. By using
the algorithm for the quantum decoding problem together with Regev's reduction,
we derive a quantum algorithm sampling codewords from the dual code according
to a probability distribution which is the dual of the original noise. It turns
out that at the information theoretic limit, we get the most likely nonzero
codeword of the dual code. When the distribution is a decreasing function of
the weight, we find minimal nonzero codewords. Note that Regev's reduction used
together with classical decoding is much less satisfying since it is not able
to output those minimum weight codewords.

Abstract: Estimating nonlinear properties such as R\'enyi entropies and
observable-weighted moments serves as a central strategy for spectrum
spectroscopy, which is fundamental to property prediction and analysis in
quantum information science, statistical mechanics, and many-body physics.
However, existing approaches are susceptible to noise and require significant
resources, making them challenging for near-term quantum hardware. In this
work, we introduce a framework for resource-efficient simultaneous estimation
of quantum state moments via qubit reuse. For an $m$-qubit quantum state
$\rho$, our method achieves the simultaneous estimation of the full hierarchy
of moments $\text{Tr}(\rho^2), \dots, \text{Tr}(\rho^k)$, as well as arbitrary
polynomial functionals and their observable-weighted counterparts. By
leveraging qubit reset operations, our core circuit for simultaneous moment
estimation requires only $2m+1$ physical qubits and $\mathcal{O}(k)$ CSWAP
gates, achieving a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(k \log k /
\varepsilon^2)$. We demonstrate this protocol's utility by showing that the
estimated moments yield tight bounds on a state's maximum eigenvalue and
present applications in quantum virtual cooling to access low-energy states of
the Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we show the protocol's viability on
near-term quantum hardware by experimentally measuring higher-order R\'enyi
entropy on a superconducting quantum processor. Our method provides a scalable
and resource-efficient route to quantum system characterization and
spectroscopy on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: We study Semi-Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD) with a focus on finite-size
security bounds, developed through three complementary perspectives. (i)
Spectral disturbance: wrong-basis L\"uders updates produce closed-form spectra
and purity loss, which serve as basis-independent indicators of disturbance.
(ii) Operator-theoretic reduction: in Z/Z-sifted rounds, intercept-resend
attacks can be represented as an effective depolarizing channel, characterized
by a fidelity-QBER relation. (iii) Entropic trade-offs: Maassen-Uffink and
memory-assisted uncertainty relations certify security through X tests and
reflection rounds, even when the sifted QBER is low. The exposition provides
step-by-step derivations supported by physically interpretable figures, and the
framework concludes with finite-size estimates based on concentration
inequalities that are suited for practical parameter estimation.

Result: Experiments indicate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in non-uniform error conditions, crucial for scalable quantum systems.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for scalable, modular, and fault-tolerant quantum computing by leveraging approximate distributed error correction strategies.

Abstract: Modular quantum computing architectures require error correction schemes that
remain effective in the presense of noisy inter-processor operations. We

advantage over existing approaches in the highly non-uniform error landscape of
a distributed quantum computer. As a concrete realization, we present encoding
and decoding circuits for the permutation-invariant W- state code and propose

Conclusion: 该研究结果对于单设备setting的安全性分析提供了新的理论支撑。

Abstract: Compiled nonlocal games transfer the power of Bell-type multi-prover tests
into a single-device setting by replacing spatial separation with cryptography.
Concretely, the KLVY compiler (STOC'23) maps any multi-prover game to an
interactive single-prover protocol, using quantum homomorphic encryption. A
crucial security property of such compilers is quantum soundness, which ensures
that a dishonest quantum prover cannot exceed the original game's quantum
value. For practical cryptographic implementations, this soundness must be
quantitative, providing concrete bounds, rather than merely asymptotic. While
quantitative quantum soundness has been established for the KLVY compiler in
the bipartite case, it has only been shown asymptotically for multipartite
games. This is a significant gap, as multipartite nonlocality exhibits
phenomena with no bipartite analogue, and the difficulty of enforcing
space-like separation makes single-device compilation especially compelling.
This work closes this gap by showing the quantitative quantum soundness of the
KLVY compiler for all multipartite nonlocal games. On the way, we introduce an
NPA-like hierarchy for quantum instruments and prove its completeness, thereby
characterizing correlations from operationally-non-signaling sequential
strategies. We further develop novel geometric arguments for the decomposition
of sequential strategies into their signaling and non-signaling parts, which
might be of independent interest.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to explore the fundamental principles that enable the exceptional capabilities of ultrashort laser pulses in materials processing, as well as the challenges that limit their scalability.

Method: The paper reviews the reasons for the success of ultrashort pulse lasers, identifies limiting factors, and discusses strategies to overcome these limitations, providing a comprehensive understanding of both the capabilities and potential challenges in laser-based material processing.

Result: The paper highlights the significant advancements and challenges in ultrashort laser pulse technology, emphasizing their transformative impact on materials processing while acknowledging current limitations.

Conclusion: In conclusion, while ultrashort laser pulses offer unparalleled precision and efficiency in materials processing, advancements in technology and innovation are essential to overcome limitations and further enhance their application potential.

Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they
allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such
fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light
that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while
simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high
peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique
tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time
required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling,
from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse
energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via
diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence,
the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or
ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred
nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable
nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation
and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the
reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials
processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids.
We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision
or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or
processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and
questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.

continuous wave and ultrashort pulsed lasers and their interaction with various
materials. Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass,
momentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that
captures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite
Volume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where
detailed experimental data are available. Macroscopic examples with continuous
wave lasers include keyhole drilling and collapse under stationary illumination
as well as melt pool dynamics and pore formation in copper welding. At the
microscopic level, copper ablation with femtosecond pulses is simulated.
  Finally, a set of real-world applications is shown, where the model helps to
explain and optimize industrial phenomena and defects. Examples include deep
penetration welding of steel with dynamic beam shaping, multilayer additive
manufacturing via powder bed fusion, and ultrashort pulsed drilling of micro
vias in dielectric materials.

Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are commonly used to calculate photon reflectance,
absorptance, and transmittance of multi-layer scattering and absorbing media,
but they can quickly become prohibitively expensive as the number of layers
increases. In this study, we show that although a plain neural network suffers
from the curse of dimensionality and fails to yield acceptable predictions of
multilayer media, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on the
same Monte Carlo simulation dataset to achieve accurate prediction with great
acceleration. Our RNN architecture solves the curse of dimensionality by
keeping the number of inputs into the network constant for any number of
layers. We demonstrate the general applicability with three diverse case
studies of multilayer architectures: tissue, radiative cooling paint, and
atmospheric clouds, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude acceleration over Monte
Carlo simulations while providing up to one order of magnitude less error than
a plain neural network. This recurrent neural network approach enables
affordable photon multi-layer modeling, optimization, and high throughput
screening for broad applications across dosimetry, atmospheric studies, and
spectrally selective radiative coatings.

Abstract: We study the conditions required to distinguish laser-induced nonlinear
quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in vacuum from competing signals due to
interactions of laser pulses with ionized residual gas. The latter is
inevitably present in vacuum chambers where experiments are performed because
the vacuum is never perfect and there is always some residual pressure. The
rarefied gas contribution is modeled statistically using the 1D-1V
Vlasov-Maxwell system, while vacuum nonlinearities are described within the
weak-field expansion of the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. In both cases,
photon spectra from wave-mixing processes are evaluated by solving numerically
the resulting partial differential equations using a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We
consider short pulses in co- and counter-propagating configurations, allowing
us to identify the laser intensities and vacuum pressures for which the vacuum
signal dominates. These results provide quantitative guidance for future
all-optical experiments aiming to detect light-by-light scattering in vacuum.

Abstract: Nanodiamonds (NDs) are key materials for building nanoscale quantum sensing,
imaging and communication devices. Scalable configuration of single NDs on
heterogeneous platforms, forming photonic quantum source arrays, will be an
essential solution towards realizing next-generation practical and industrial
quantum devices. However, NDs are challenging to manipulate because their size,
shape and surface chemistry vary substantially. Here, we show a simple method
based on electrostatic-trapping to rapidly and reliably pattern single ND
arrays on arbitrary substrates at scale. Our method, which uses carefully
engineered microscale hole templates and electrostatic force, captures single
NDs across 8-inch wafers with 82.5% yields within 5 min. Systematic
experimental and theoretical studies show the number of deposited NDs primarily
depends on the diameter of the hole trap. The method is compatible with mature
CMOS technologies, enabling the mass production of scalable and integrable
quantum devices. This advancement is expected to accelerate the

Abstract: Sculpting light across its independent degrees of freedom-from orbital
angular momentum to the discrete wavelengths of optical frequency combs-has
unlocked vast communication bandwidth by enabling massively parallel
information channels. However, the Shannon-Hartley theorem sets a hard limit by
tying channel capacity to the trade-off between SNR and rate, a central
challenge in communication. Inspired by lock-in amplification in electronics,
we encode data on THz optical burst carriers so the signal resides beyond the
conventional noise band, yielding exceptional robustness. By leveraging a
programmable all-degree-of-freedom (All-DoF) modulator, we generate a
spatiotemporal topological comb (ST-Comb) that structures light into a vast,
highentropy state space for high-dimensional information encoding. Crucially,
we find that the associated topological winding number is preserved under
diverse perturbations, ensuring stable information encoding and retrieval. This
paradigm illustrates how structured light can simultaneously expand channel
dimensionality and maintain robustness, charting a pathway to chip-scale,
reconfigurable photonic platforms for the PHz era, while also opening
previously inaccessible regimes of light-matter interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the limitations of metasurfaces in mid-IR applications, particularly due to material constraints and substrate absorption.

Method: The method involves creating high-Q resonances with high-contrast using single-crystalline silicon membranes, combined with electro-thermal and ultrafast all-optical tuning mechanisms.

Result: The metasurfaces achieve record-high Q-factors of up to 3000, 50% modulation depth at low voltages, and nanosecond response times for dynamic applications.

Conclusion: These advancements open new possibilities in mid-IR sensing, communication, thermal management, and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Metasurfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to control free-space light
at the subwavelength scale, enabling applications in sensing, lasing, nonlinear
optics, and quantum photonics. However, their practical deployment is hindered
by two key limitations: a tradeoff between low-Q resonances and weak amplitude
contrast, and their predominantly static nature allowing only passive
functionalities. These challenges are further aggravated in the
application-relevant mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, where the lack of suitable
low-loss materials and the strong absorption of common substrates such as
silicon oxide or sapphire severely constrain performance and scalability. Here,
we address these issues with actively tunable single-crystalline silicon
membrane metasurfaces that combine high-Q resonances, strong amplitude
contrast, and wafer-scale fabrication compatible dimensions for high throughput
manufacturing. Our platform achieves record-high measured Q-factors up to 3000
in the mid-IR spectrum, supporting efficient dynamic modulation through two
distinct schemes: (i) on-chip electro-thermal tuning via Joule heating,
sustaining 50% modulation depth at CMOS-compatible voltages and speeds up to
14.5 kHz, and (ii) ultrafast all-optical modulation via carrier generation in
silicon, reaching nanosecond response times and estimated sub-GHz modulation
rates. By uniting sharp resonances, strong contrast, large-scale
manufacturability, and dynamic tunability, our active silicon membrane
metasurfaces advance the frontier of mid-IR nanophotonics and open new
opportunities in sensing, free-space communication, thermal radiation
management, and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used in modern science and technology to enable a
wide range of both quantum and classical applications. Recently, the growing
demand for miniaturization and high performance has fueled the exploration of
new fabrication methods beyond traditional polishing techniques and macroscopic
mirrors. Visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are particularly important
for quantum applications, where achieving low-loss resonators is also more
challenging than in the telecom range, presenting unique challenges and
opportunities for microscopic cavity systems. Here, we present a novel

demonstrated flexible device geometries, including singular mirrors and mirror

across a wide range of cavity lengths. Additionally, we can produce
easy-to-assemble microcavity packages, with a total volume of ~2 (4)

Abstract: Overcoming the trade-off between wide field of view (FOV) and compactness
remains a central challenge for integrating near-infrared (NIR) imaging into
smartphones and AR glasses. Existing refractive NIR optics cannot
simultaneously achieve ultra-wide angles above 100{\deg} and ultrathin total
track length (TTL) below 5 mm, limiting their use in portable devices. Here, we
present a wafer-level-manufactured meta-aspheric lens (MAL) that achieves a
101.5{\deg} FOV, 3.39 mm TTL, and F/1.64 aperture within a compact volume of
0.02 cubic centimeters. Unlike previous hybrid lenses with separate refractive
and diffractive components, our MAL features a fully integrated structure,
which enables a compact form factor. This integration also simplifies
fabrication, allowing high-throughput production via micrometer-level precision
alignment and bonding on a single wafer, with only one dicing step and no need
for additional mechanical fixtures. Furthermore, the design process explicitly
considers manufacturability and accurately models metalens dispersion, ensuring
that experimental performance matches simulated results. We validate our MAL
through both direct and computational imaging experiments. Despite its small
form factor, our scalable MAL demonstrates strong NIR imaging performance in
blood vessel imaging, eye tracking, and computational pixel super-resolution
tasks. This scalable MAL technology establishes a new benchmark for
high-performance, miniaturized NIR imaging and opens the door to
next-generation smartphone and AR optical systems.

Method: The research proposes a SP-AONNs structure, using modular 4F optical systems to evaluate performance.

Result: Increasing parallel sub-networks improves accuracy, noise robustness, and model expressivity.

Conclusion: Spatial parallelism is a promising strategy for advancing optical neural computing capabilities.

Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for
ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of
multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a
configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs)
being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer
from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and
critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex
relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture
for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that
sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical
layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed
simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference
between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable
nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or
iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and
evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel
sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and
expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a
practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical
neural computing.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在光子集成平台上的单片自参考高重复率频率梳实现，具有超紧凑和高度可访问性，为新型光谱计量与光致综合工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: A fully stabilized frequency comb is essential for precision metrology and
coherent optical synthesis. However, fully-stabilized frequency combs generally
require separate stages for supercontinuum generation (SCG) and
self-referencing, largely limiting their compactness. Here, enabled by the
low-threshold multi-octave supercontinuum generation and concurrent
third-harmonic generation in low-loss silicon nitride waveguides, we present a
novel approach to a self-referenced frequency comb source at 1 GHz repetition
rate spanning from the full visible (VIS) to the mid-infrared (MIR). Our
coherent comb is seeded by an all-polarization-maintaining ultrafast fiber
laser at 1556 nm, with a pulse duration of 73 fs at 1 GHz repetition rate. With
an injected energy of merely 110 pJ, the pulses propagate through
dispersion-engineered Si3N4 waveguides, generating supercontinuum spanning over
three octaves from 350-3280 nm i.e. 0.76 PHz of coherent bandwidth. Moreover,
the on-chip third harmonic generation provides a carrier envelope offset beat
note via f-3f with a signal-to-noise ratio of 43 dB. Fueled by the evolving
photonic integration providing possibilities of on-chip filtering and
photo-detectors, this approach for single-chip self-referencing of
high-repetition-rate frequency combs paves the way for ultrabroadband comb
sources with unprecedented compactness and field-readiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for AI training and inference, coupled with stringent latency and energy budgets, is driving the adoption of integrated photonics. However, as active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) scale, current routing methods are insufficient, necessitating a new end-to-end routing flow for large-scale PICs.

Method: The framework introduces a physically-aware global planner for congestion and crossing-aware routing, considering photonic component placement and waveguide constraints. Additionally, a sequence-consistent track assignment and soft guidance-assisted detailed routing are proposed to enhance routability and reduce via usage.

Result: The router achieves significant improvements, reducing the number of vias by up to 99%, design rule violations by up to 98%, and runtime by 17x compared to manual and existing VLSI router baselines. This establishes a practical foundation for electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) at system scale.

Conclusion: This breakthrough framework addresses critical routing challenges in large-scale active PICs, enabling efficient and high-quality routing solutions while significantly improving overall design efficiency.

Abstract: The rising demand for AI training and inference, as well as scientific
computing, combined with stringent latency and energy budgets, is driving the
adoption of integrated photonics for computing, sensing, and communications. As
active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) scale in device count and functional
heterogeneity, physical implementation by manual scripting and ad-hoc edits is
no longer tenable. This creates an immediate need for an electronic-photonic
design automation (EPDA) stack in which physical design automation is a core
capability. However, there is currently no end-to-end fully automated routing
flow that coordinates photonic waveguides and on-chip metal interconnect.
Critically, available digital VLSI and analog/custom routers are not directly
applicable to PIC metal routing due to a lack of customization to handle
constraints induced by photonic devices and waveguides. We present, to our
knowledge, the first end-to-end routing framework for large-scale active PICs
that jointly addresses waveguides and metal wires within a unified flow. We
introduce a physically-aware global planner that generates congestion- and
crossing-aware routing guides while explicitly accounting for the placement of
photonic components and waveguides. We further propose a sequence-consistent
track assignment and a soft guidance-assisted detailed routing to speed up the
routing process with significantly optimized routability and via usage.
Evaluated on various large PIC designs, our router delivers fast, high-quality
active PIC routing solutions with fewer vias, lower congestion, and competitive
runtime relative to manual and existing VLSI router baselines; on average it
reduce via count by ~99%, user-specified design rule violation by ~98%, and
runtime by 17x, establishing a practical foundation for EPDA at system scale.

Motivation: Twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising platform for topological photonics and light-based technologies, and this work provides a framework for understanding and designing photonic crystals.

Method: Utilizes generalized Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory to model non-Hermitian photonic systems, derives interlayer coupling from Wannier functions, and performs numerical simulations for validation.

Result: Predicts four-fold band splitting in far-field spectrum, confirmed with simulations. Proposes tunable flat band cavities using Brillion zone folding perturbation.

Conclusion: This theory offers a comprehensive approach to understanding and engineering photonic crystal properties, with applications in nonlinear optics and quantum devices

Abstract: We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes
into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is
based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation
theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling
is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the
Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states
at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that
in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a
twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb
lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a
four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer
case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals
that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\Gamma} point
via the moir\'e potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a
wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large
twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The
cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a
divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics,
lasing and quantum optics.

Abstract: Advanced holographic techniques are increasingly demanded for high-capacity
and secure information processing. In this context, orbital angular momentum
(OAM) stands out as a powerful resource for optical multiplexing, offering
access to an unbounded set of orthogonal modes. To harness this potential,
metasurfaces, with their considerable ability to control light, have emerged as
key platforms for OAM-multiplexed holography. Nevertheless, conventional OAM
holography suffers from limited polarization engineering capabilities due to
the lack of chirality control in single-layer metasurfaces. Here, we introduce
a bi-layer metasurface architecture that realizes total angular momentum (TAM)
vectorial holography, where TAM represents the combination of spin angular
momentum (SAM, equivalent to polarization) and OAM of light. In contrast to
previous approaches, this scheme enables true polarization-OAM multiplexing,
facilitating the independent generation of vectorial holographic images for
each orthogonal TAM input state. This concept is validated numerically and
experimentally, confirming the feasibility of TAM vectorial holography. The
proposed scheme can be easily integrated with other recent holography
generation approaches, such as vector beam multiplexing and bidirectional
holography, thereby further expanding its multiplexing capability. This work
establishes a versatile framework for advanced full-vectorial holography,
showing how metasurfaces can unlock multiplexing strategies for emerging
photonic systems.

Abstract: Light-field imaging is an emerging paradigm in biomedical optics, offering
the unique ability to capture volumetric information in a single snapshot by
encoding both the spatial and angular components of light. Unlike conventional
three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities that rely on mechanical or optical
scanning, light-field imaging enables high-speed volumetric acquisition, making
it particularly well-suited for capturing rapid biological dynamics. This
review outlines the theoretical foundations of light-field imaging and surveys
its core implementations across microscopy, mesoscopy, and endoscopy. Special
attention is given to the fundamental trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial
resolution, and depth of field, as well as recent advances that address these
limitations through compressive sensing, deep learning, and meta-optics. By
positioning light-field imaging within the broader landscape of biomedical
imaging technologies, we highlight its unique strengths, existing challenges,
and future potential as a scalable and versatile tool for biological discovery
and clinical applications.

### [231] [Chat to Chip: Large Language Model Based Design of Arbitrarily Shaped Metasurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24196)
*Huanshu Zhang,Lei Kang,Sawyer D. Campbell,Douglas H. Werner*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the use of large language models (LLMs) for the design of arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, showing that with appropriate tokenization, LLMs can effectively predict and design nanophotonic devices, bridging the gap between natural language and electromagnetic modeling, thus creating a user-friendly design workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational cost of full-wave simulations for metasurface design has limited exploration of complex configurations. Data-driven approaches, particularly using neural networks, have emerged as a solution. However, integrating LLMs into this process presents a unique opportunity to simplify the design workflow, especially for arbitrary geometries.

Method: The paper describes the methodology of using LLMs for designing arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces. The approach involves tokenizing the metasurface geometries and leveraging the LLM's ability to learn physical relationships for spectral prediction and inverse design. Several open-weight LLMs are benchmarked to identify optimal model architectures and hyperparameters for this task.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates that 1-D token-wise LLMs can be effectively utilized for designing 2-D arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces. This method shows promise in automating and simplifying the metasurface design process, particularly when combined with graphical network representations of geometries.

Conclusion: The integration of large language models with traditional metasurface design opens new possibilities for efficient and user-friendly design of nanophotonic devices. This approach eliminates the need for manual task-specific network building and hyperparameter tuning, marking a significant step forward in automated optical function implementation.

Abstract: Traditional metasurface design is limited by the computational cost of
full-wave simulations, preventing thorough exploration of complex
configurations. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this
bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations
and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing
a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific
network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and
hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast,
sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However,
applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for
arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks
often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with
descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the
physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We
further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships
between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated
that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily
shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic
modelling, this "chat-to-chip" workflow represents a step toward more
user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.

TL;DR: 实现用于微器件的电致发光固体衬材料razaing into challenging.卤化铅盐perovskites提供了一个有希望的平台，因为它们的工作室在光激发后的单晶腔和预先设计或后处理后的微结构显示出低激光阈值。间接的电致激发通过在一个集成设备中插入高亮度led和高增益介质 recently实现，利用了成熟的技术概念。将直接的载流子注入到一个通过辅助短、光脉冲激发的perovskite LED中， resulted into amplifed spontaneous emission.其他工程有潜力实现结构，尚未临床获得lasing. 我们开发了一种新策略，实现了对perovskite laser的直接电致激发。我们在溶液生长的CsPbBr3微片中集成化学惰性单壁碳纳米管电极，并将它们放入光微室。通过将微设备冷却至8 K，保持恒定电流，形成一个p-i-n结，使其在高电流密度下实现平衡的载流子注入。拥有强耦合的perovskite微腔组件在65 µA的直流电流下表现出极化光栅模式。

Method: 在液相生长CsPbBr3微片中集成惰性单壁碳纳米管电极，并将其放入光微室，结合低温下形成p-i-n结的方法，实现了直接电致激发下的极化光栅。

Result: 在65 µA的直流电流下，通过液相生长的CsPbBr3微腔组件，实现了有效的极化光栅模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为实现微器件中的电致发光提供了新途径，特别是在强耦合 regimes 下，展示了高效的小电流下的lasing能力。这一进展推动了对Halide perovskites在微器件中的应用的理解和开发。

Abstract: Reaching lasing in electrically pumped microdevices based on
solution-processed semiconductors poses a major scientific and technological
challenge. Halide perovskites offer a promising platform for electrical
injection, since their optically excited single-crystal cavities and
predesigned or postprocessed microstructures have exhibited low lasing
threshold. Indirect electrical pumping of a dual-cavity perovskite laser was
recently obtained, utilizing a well-established technological concept of
embedding a high-luminosity light-emitting diode (LED) with a high-gain medium
into an integrated device. Direct charge-carrier injection into a perovskite
LED excited by auxiliary short-, optical-pulses resulted into amplified
spontaneous emission. Other efforts for rational engineering of architectures
that allow for high charge-carrier density are still to demonstrate lasing.
Here, we develop a novel strategy for achieving direct electrical pumping of a
perovskite laser. We integrate a solution-grown CsPbBr3 microplate with
chemically inert single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and embed them into
an optical microcavity. By cooling the microdevice down to 8 K at a constant
current, a perovskite p-i-n diode is formed that facilitates a balanced carrier
injection at high current densities. The perovskite microcavity diode operates
in the strong coupling regime, exhibiting polariton lasing under a direct
current of 65 uA.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for creating a high-quality, sharply defined,
non-diffracting optical bottle beam by focusing a Bessel beam propagating
through a flat multi-level diffractive lens (MDL). This study highlights the
impact of the MDL illuminated by a Bessel beam with suppressed sidelobes
generated from a binary axicon. The resulting Bessel bottle beam exhibits a
series of low- or zero-intensity zones interleaved with high-intensity regions,
with variable periods ranging from 0.2 to 1.36 mm along the beam propagation.
The transverse intensity profiles of these regions remain shape-invariant over
long distances in free space, and thereby the non-diffracting range of the
micron-sized optical bottle beam exceeds 5 cm. We also observe that the
far-field output from the MDL illuminated by a Bessel beam offers advantages
over conventional focusing lenses. Furthermore, this technique can operate on
ultrafast timescales (from pico- to femtoseconds) due to the high damage
thresholds of the binary axicon and MDL, enabling the generation of high-power
optical bottle beams. Ultimately, our experimental approach paves the way for
various applications, including high-resolution biological imaging in turbid
media, particle manipulation, micromachining, and harmonic generation,
leveraging the spatial landscape of the optical bottle beam.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the quantum Rabi model in two-level systems and its application to 2D transition-metal dichalcogenide materials. It demonstrates using variable-temperature reflectance and fluorescence, that these materials can mimic quantum Rabi oscillations under certain conditions, such as with hBN capping. Decoherence times, Rabi frequencies, and transition matrix elements are found to be temperature-dependent and influenced by material layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum Rabi oscillations in 2D materials is important for advancing quantum optics and optoelectronic applications in the second quantum revolution.

Method: Experiments involving few-layer WSe2 flakes, with and without hBN capping, under varying temperatures. Analysis using quantum Rabi model under rotating wave approximation.

Result: Quantum Rabi oscillations are observed, with properties (decoherence time, Rabi frequency, transition matrix elements) showing clear temperature and layer dependence.

Conclusion: The findings provide a new perspective for understanding quantum properties of 2D materials, potentially aiding in their application in quantum technologies.

Abstract: A fully quantized description of a two-level system resonantly coupled with
an electromagnetic field (light) is among the central topics of quantum
electrodynamics, which is theorized by the quantum Rabi model. It is also a
fundamental issue of light-matter interactions. The rapid development of
two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) atomically-thin
semiconductors brings excellent great chance to test and demonstrate some basic
predictions by quantum optics theory in textbook, i.e., by the quantum Rabi
model. Such test and demonstration are of both scientific and technological
significance because of the quick emergence of the second quantum revolution.
In this Letter, we show a quantum optics demonstration of the
variable-temperature optical responses of the elementary excitations in
few-layer WSe2 flakes. It is unraveled that the variable-temperature
reflectance and fluorescence patterns of the elementary excitations (i.e., the
band-edge excitons) of monolayer, bilayer and hBN capped WSe2 match well with
the predictions by the quantum Rabi model under the rotating wave
approximation. Decoherence times, Rabi frequencies, and transition matrix
elements of the elementary excitations in these few-layer WSe2 flakes are found
to be all negatively correlated with temperature, and to show dependence on
layer number and capping layer. These findings may provide a novel perspective
for comprehending the fundamental quantum physical properties of
two-dimensional materials.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper explores the enhancement of dissipative soliton energy scalability by using a low-power seed synchronized with a chirped-pulse oscillator, showing that it can effectively suppress multiple-pulse generation and stabilize single solitons under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the scalability and stability of dissipative solitons is crucial for applications in optical communications and all-optical signal processing.

Method: The study uses mathematical modeling and experimental setup involving fiber optics to investigate the effects of synchronized injection and chirped pulses on soliton behavior.

Result: The research demonstrates that moderate seed powers can prevent mode-locking and stabilize solitons, while excessively high powers destabilize them by enabling stochastic resonance.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into controlling soliton instability, offering practical methods to enhance their reliability for real-world applications.

Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the dissipative soliton energy scalability
by the injection of a low-power single-mode seed synchronized with a
chirped-pulse oscillator round-trip. It is demonstrated that a threshold-like
transition to multiple-pulse generation limits the maximum energies of
dissipative solitons, in agreement with the thermodynamic interpretation of a
strongly chirped pulse stability. We show that there are ``islands'' of
instability within a stability range of energies which result from stochastic
resonance between ``internal modes'' of soliton and quantum noise of the
``basin''. The transition to multiple-pulsing can be suppressed in a system
driven by a comparatively low-power seed. However, seed power growth increases
the mode-locking energy threshold and produces ``islands'' of instability as
the dissipative soliton energy rises.

Abstract: Metamaterials exhibiting hyperbolic dispersion enable unprecedented control
over light-matter interactions, from sub-diffraction imaging to enhanced
spontaneous emission. However, conventional plasmonic hyperbolic metamaterials
suffer from limited tunability and lack intrinsic emission capabilities,
constraining their utility for active photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate
the first room-temperature, electrically tunable, excitonic hyperbolic
metamaterial using aligned films of chirality-pure semiconducting carbon
nanotubes. Unlike plasmonic systems, these excitonic metamaterials of aligned
nanotubes combine strong optical anisotropy with dynamic electrostatic
tunability. Spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals that the hyperbolic dispersion
window can be electrically shifted by 53 meV, enabling real-time switching
between hyperbolic and elliptical regimes. Theory predicts that this tunability
translates to the propagation angle being modulated by 34{\deg}, driven by a
momentum enhancement 3.11 times that of free space, limited primarily by
material losses that can be mitigated through improved alignment. In addition,
simulations of the system exhibit a high Purcell factor of 1550 and a
modulation of 37 % without an optical cavity for a dipole placed 5 nm above the
aligned nanotubes. These findings establish excitonic carbon nanotubes as a
versatile platform for dynamically reconfigurable photonic metamaterials,
opening pathways for adaptive optical devices, electrically-controlled
spontaneous emission, and tunable hyper-lenses operating at room temperature.

Abstract: Advances in integrated photonics have enabled unprecedented level of control
of light, powering a wide range of photonic technologies from communications
and computing to precision metrology and quantum information. However, the
conventional on-chip optical signal processing approaches based on optical
waveguides and cavities suffer from their large physical footprint and narrow
operating bandwidth, respectively. To address this, we propose and
experimentally demonstrate, using the thin film lithium niobate (TFLN)
photonics, a modular, recursive optical signal processing framework. In our
approach, fast electro-optic (EO) switch is used to either keep an optical
packet inside the loop, with the processing element embedded within, or to
release it from the loop and direct it towards the output waveguide. By
configuring the switch on a timescale shorter than a time the photon spends
traversing the loop, this architecture can achieve different optical
pathlengths in a compact footprint without sacrificing optical bandwidth. As an
example, we embed a phase-modulator (PM) inside the loop and demonstrate a
frequency shift of optical packets up to 420 GHz, using only a 3 GHz sinusoidal
microwave signal. By replacing the PM with chirped Bragg gratings (CBG), we
demonstrate recursive delay line featuring large group delays of 28 ps/nm over
a 30 nm optical bandwidth. Finally, by introducing asymmetric Mach-Zehnder
interferometer (AMZI) inside the loop, we demonstrate a reconfigurable
differentiation of the optical packet in time, up to an unprecedented
fifth-order. Our results establish a powerful and scalable platform for
multifunctional photonic processing, setting the stage for next-generation
integrated systems with ultrahigh reconfigurability and spectral-temporal
versatility.
