The usual representation of the index involves a multi-dimensional contour integral over the BPS spectrum of the free gauge theory. To find a closed form expression for the index, it is natural to attempt a residue evaluation. However, the presence of a non-isolated essential singularity inside the contour prevents a straightforward implementation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by gauge-fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Macdonald index, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. The simplified form manifests the strongly coupled BPS spectrum of the Macdonald sector of the theory, and suggests the absence of ``non-graviton'' operators in this sector. We also evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form."}

Using real-space dynamical mean-field theory (RDMFT), we investigate the formation of the (superradiant) checkerboard density-wave phase both at quarter and half filling. We focus on the paramagnetic phase assuming sufficiently high temperatures such that no magnetic long-range order develops. At quarter filling, we find a reentrant homogeneous Fermi liquid to density wave phase transition with increasing temperature, which is due to the higher entropy of the ordered phase. At half filling, in addition to the Fermi liquid to Mott insulator phase transition, marked by a vanishing quasiparticle residue at the Fermi level, we identify the transition into a density-wave phase. Due to perfect Fermi surface nesting at half filling, we find that arbitrarily small long-range interactions destabilize the system towards the density-wave phase in the absence of short-range interactions. By varying short- and long-range interactions at a fixed low temperature, we obtain the full phase diagram and identify a region of coexistence between the homogeneous Fermi liquid and Mott insulating phase with the density-wave phase.

The ground-state languages have exponential growth constants $λ_K$ that decrease monotonically, starting from the value associated with the ``golden chain'' (approximately 1.618) and progressing toward 1. This process yields a staircase of topological-entropy plateaus that flows to an aperiodic fixed point, also known as the Fibonacci subshift. The first nontrivial rung ($K=4$) is the ``Plastic chain,'' which forbids \\texttt{SS} and \\texttt{LLL}. We prove its ground-state counts follow a specific four-term linear recurrence relation and provide a closed-form solution governed by the plastic constant $ρ\\approx 1.3247$.

Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission.

For large RISs, experimental MC estimation is fundamentally challenging because of the quadratic scaling of the number of unknowns with the number of RIS elements. In this Letter, we present a generic and flexible reduced-rank MC representation that allows wireless practitioners to choose a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. We experimentally validate the direct reduced-rank MC estimation for a 100-element RIS in three radio environments (rich scattering, attenuated scattering, free space). We observe a strong environmental dependence of the influence of rank reduction on accuracy. Model-based performance evaluations highlight that the importance of MC awareness in optimization depends strongly on the radio environment and the performance indicator."}

The perforation of the graphene layer forms interdigital arrays of graphene microribbons (GMRs) interconnected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. These GNR constrictions act as energy barriers for electrons and holes emitted from the GMRs and govern the inter-GMR thermionic current under an applied bias voltage. The doping and the voltage bias establish distinct electron and hole populations in adjacent GMRs. Peltier heating of these carriers within the GMRs increases their effective temperatures, thereby enhancing the inter-GMR current. The resulting positive feedback between carrier heating and current amplification can trigger an electrothermal breakdown, transforming a superlinear current-voltage dependence into an S-shaped characteristic exhibiting negative differential resistance. The degree of electron-hole asymmetry significantly influences this positive feedback and strongly modifies the overall current-voltage response. These results provide a framework for optimizing PGM-based devices employing GMR/GNR architectures, including voltage-controlled fast switches, incandescent emitters, and terahertz bolometric detectors."}

The effect of rotational frequency $Ω$ is investigated numerically by determining the corresponding number of stable vortices in the superfluid, together with the respective energy per particle $E$ and chemical potential $μ$. The LHY superfluid provides a deep minimum of $E$ and $μ$, indicating that it is a remarkably robust state of quantum matter. By fixing the LHY interaction strength, an exact single-vortex critical frequency is found, along with the respective chemical potential. A notable feature, observed when creating the LHY superfluid with fewer than five vortices, which is understood as being due to the superfluid's nonlinearity and trapping aspect ratio, is the large frequency ranges admitting the production of two and four vortices, as compared to the small frequency ranges to obtain one and three vortices."}

Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication."}

We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves. This framework provides a robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations."}

We present a general procedure to identify this $U(1)_A$ symmetry and, whenever possible, show that it produces the known prescription for computing the Macdonald index from the refined character of the associated vertex operator algebra.

For practical implementation of distributed FTQC, logical Bell pair preparation must be designed not only for efficient Bell pair consumption but also for the spacetime volume of the protocol; however, entanglement distillation protocols have primarily focused on minimizing the consumption of Bell pairs, often resulting in protocols that require a substantial number of local operations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations. Guided by this metric, we propose entanglement boosting protocol, which achieves efficient preparation of logical Bell pairs encoded in rotated surface code with LLV reduced by orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. In this protocol, paralleling recent advances in magic state cultivation, we employ soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress the logical error rates of Bell pairs to practical levels in the order of $10^{-10}$ from fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs while all local operations are implementable within a spatial region of a single surface code patch. We also present a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation using high-rate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling arbitrarily low logical error rates while also maintaining physically efficient implementations.

While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources."}

To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.\n  We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\\,μ\\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\\,μ\\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\\,μ\\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\\,μ\\text{m}$.\n  Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires."}

The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states."}

By expressing this density operator in the continuous position basis, we show how the spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, as they transition from being quantum to classical in nature. We further identify a finite range of propagation distances over which the angle-OAM entanglement is maximized, which provides valuable insights for designing free-space quantum communication links operating over several kilometers through the turbulent atmosphere."}

This paper presents a deep learning-enhanced framework for delineating anticoagulant efficacy ex vivo using Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM). We demonstrate a label-free, non-invasive approach for analyzing human blood samples, capable of accurate cell counting and morphological estimation. A DHM with an automated image processing and deep learning pipeline is built for morphological analysis of the blood cells under two different anti-coagulation agents, e.g. conventional EDTA and novel potassium ferric oxalate nanoparticles (KFeOx-NPs). This enables automated high-throughput screening of cells and estimation of blood coagulation rates when samples are treated with different anticoagulants. Results indicated that KFeOx-NPs prevented human blood coagulation without altering the cellular morphology of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas EDTA incubation caused notable changes within 6 hours of incubation. The system allows for quantitative analysis of coagulation dynamics by assessing parameters like cell clustering and morphology over time in these prepared samples, offering insights into the comparative efficacy and effects of anticoagulants outside the body."}

At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set.

In this work, we present a method to certify whether a quantum channel can preserve entanglement dimension above a given threshold. Unlike existing approaches, our method is faithful -- it can be applied to any channel, and avoids common assumptions such as reliable preparation of entangled states, auxiliary side channels, or perfect measurement devices.

Upon dimensional reduction to $3+1$ spacetime through a specific embedding, the model naturally develops anisotropy in the scale factor and density, consistent with the near-zero spatial curvature inferred from Planck data. In the case of vanishing spatial curvature, the framework reproduces Milne's Newtonian cosmology because this condition leads to a vanishing pressure. This provides an independent nonrelativistic setting for cosmological dynamics within Galilean covariance."}

However, conventional implementations require polarization-diverse detection and are therefore incompatible with most commercial OCT systems. As a result, PS-OCT has largely remained restricted to specialized research groups, limiting its broader scientific and clinical use. Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments."}

We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves. This framework provides a robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations."}

We investigate how to inversely design plasmonic nanostructures using conditional generative adversarial networks. Although a conventional approach of measuring the optical properties of a given nanostructure is conceptually straightforward, inverse design remains difficult because the existence and uniqueness of an acceptable design cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the design space is often large, and simulation-based methods become quickly intractable. Deep learning methods are well-suited to tackle this problem because they can handle effectively high-dimensional input data. We train a conditional generative adversarial network model and use it for inverse design of plasmonic nanostructures based on their extinction cross section spectra. Our main result shows that adding label projection and a novel embedding network to the conditional generative adversarial network model, improves performance in terms of error estimates and convergence speed for the training algorithm. The mean absolute error is reduced by an order of magnitude in the best case, and the training algorithm converges more than three times faster on average. This is shown for two network architectures, a simpler one using a fully connected neural network architecture, and a more complex one using convolutional layers. We pre-train a convolutional neural network and use it as surrogate model to evaluate the performance of our inverse design model. The surrogate model evaluates the extinction cross sections of the design predictions, and we show that our modifications lead to equally good or better predictions of the original design compared to a baseline model. This provides an important step towards more efficient and precise inverse design methods for optical elements."}

This localization invalidates the conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating an analysis under open boundary conditions even in the thermodynamic limit. The Amoeba formulation addresses this challenge by computing the spectral potential rather than the spectrum itself. Based on the (strong) Szegö limit theorem and its topological generalization, this approach reduces the evaluation of the potential to an optimization problem involving the Ronkin function. However, while the generalized Szegö limit theorem is formally applicable in arbitrary dimensions, its implementation is limited to single-band systems, and its applicability to multiband systems remains unclear. In this paper, we establish the Wiener-Hopf factorization (WHF) of the non-Bloch Hamiltonian as a powerful framework, providing a unified and rigorous foundation for Amoeba analysis in multiband systems. By combining the WHF with Hermitian doubling, we first elucidate the applicability criteria for the generalized Szegö limit theorem in multiband systems. We then show that the WHF provides the natural mathematical origin for the symmetry-decomposed Ronkin function in symmetry class AII$^\\dagger$, leading to a rigorous proof of the generalized Szegö limit theorem for these systems and opening a path toward systematic generalizations to other symmetry classes."}

This method allows generating arbitrary geometry spatiotemporal vortices, something impossible with previously demonstrated generation schemes. We provide experimental results showing THz frequency light can be encoded with arbitrary spatiotemporal vortex geometries using simple planar fused filament prints made from a commercial 3D printer. We provide several demonstrations of unique geometries including squares, triangles, ring arrays, and arbitrary curves that cannot be generated with existing techniques. We also show that multiple ring and line vortices can be formed simultaneously, which undergo complex reconnections with propagation. While demonstrated at THz frequencies, this concept is directly applicable to visible and infrared light and our theory offers a way for optimizing STOVs for the frequency range and pulse duration of a given light source. This technique provides a practical and straight-forward method to generate arbitrary electromagnetic spatiotemporal vortices and enables production of complex spatiotemporal phenomena like vortex reconnections."}

However, reliably nucleating these 3D textures has proven challenging, and so far, 3D configurations such as vortex rings and hopfions can often only be observed forming spontaneously in relatively uncontrolled manners. Here, we demonstrate that through the 3D nanopatterning of chiral single crystal helimagnets into nano-tori, the controlled formation of a magnetic double helix can be achieved. This surface-localized topological state is stabilized by the interplay of intrinsic exchange interactions of the single crystal with the extrinsic emergent effects of the patterned geometry. These double helices host magnetic defects akin to supercoiling in circular DNA and climbing vines.

Owing to their collective nature, these resonances produce optical responses that are both stronger and spectrally narrower than those of individual scatterers. While such phenomena have been extensively studied in conventional time-invariant systems, recent advances in time-varying photonics present new opportunities to exploit and enhance the extraordinary characteristics of these collective modes. Here, we investigate lattice resonances in periodic arrays of time-modulated scatterers using a simple framework based on the dipolar approximation and time-Floquet theory, where each scatterer is modeled as a harmonic oscillator with periodically varying optical properties. We begin by analyzing the response of an individual scatterer, leveraging our model to identify the complex eigenfrequencies that define its dynamics. We show that, for the appropriate modulation amplitude and frequency, the imaginary part of one of these eigenfrequencies vanishes, leading to amplification. Building on this, we extend our analysis to a periodic array to investigate the effect of the interplay between temporal modulation and lattice resonances. In contrast to isolated scatterers, the collective nature of lattice resonances introduces a markedly more intricate spectral dependence of the amplification regime. Notably, this amplification emerges at substantially lower modulation strengths, facilitated by the enhanced light-matter interaction and increased lifetime provided by these collective resonances. Our work establishes a simple theoretical framework for understanding collective lattice resonances in time-modulated arrays, enabling dynamic control and amplification of these modes."}

Existing analytic models often show large discrepancies with numerical relativity (NR) data, while data-driven models are limited to mass ratios of q<=8 (aligned spins) and q<=4 (precessing spins) and break down when extrapolated outside their training ranges. Using ~5000 of NR simulations from the SXS and RIT catalogs up to q=128 and ~100 black hole perturbation theory simulations up to q=200, we present two classes of models: (i) gwModel_kick_q200 (gwModel_kick_q200_GPR), an analytic (Gaussian process regression) model for aligned-spin binaries. (ii) gwModel_kick_prec_flow, a normalizing-flow model for kick distribution from precessing binaries with isotropic spins. Our approach combines analytic insights from post-Newtonian theory with data-driven techniques to ensure correct limiting behavior and high accuracy across parameter space. Both gwModel_kick_q200 and gwModel_kick_prec_flow are valid from comparable to extreme mass ratios. Extensive validation shows all three models outperform existing ones within their respective domains. Finally, using both back-of-the-envelope estimates and 1404 detailed star cluster simulations incorporating our kick models, we find that the black hole retention probability in low mass globular clusters can vary noticeably when the gwModel_kick_prec_flow model is employed. The models are publicly available through the gwModels package."}

Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers.

Since existing compilers such as the Qiskit-compiler and QR-Map (the state-of-art qubit reuse compiler) do not account for this variability, circuits with frequent MCM operations often experience substantial fidelity loss.\n  In thie paper, we propose MERA, a compilation framework that performs MCM-error-aware layout, routing, and scheduling.

Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\\pm0.07)\\%$ to $(99.61\\pm0.04)\\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware."}

Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission. When integrated into light-emitting diodes, our PeNPL devices achieve a external quantum efficiency of 13.1%, the highest reported for strongly-confined PeNPL-based devices. Taken together, these results establish ancillary ligand-induced synthesis of uniform-monolayer PeNPLs as a decisive route to robust orientation control, positioning it as the central principle for advancing next-generation photonic and display technologies."}

We propose to test non-classicality using a game based on complement sampling, an efficiently verifiable problem that achieves the largest possible separation between quantum and classical computation when both input and output represent samples from probability distributions. When restricting the input to instances inspired by the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, our game admits an exponentially large violation of classicality without relying on computational hardness assumptions. We execute the game on Quantinuum System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computers, with experiments consisting of thousands of different circuits on up to 55 qubits.

Owing to their collective nature, these resonances produce optical responses that are both stronger and spectrally narrower than those of individual scatterers. While such phenomena have been extensively studied in conventional time-invariant systems, recent advances in time-varying photonics present new opportunities to exploit and enhance the extraordinary characteristics of these collective modes. Here, we investigate lattice resonances in periodic arrays of time-modulated scatterers using a simple framework based on the dipolar approximation and time-Floquet theory, where each scatterer is modeled as a harmonic oscillator with periodically varying optical properties. We begin by analyzing the response of an individual scatterer, leveraging our model to identify the complex eigenfrequencies that define its dynamics. We show that, for the appropriate modulation amplitude and frequency, the imaginary part of one of these eigenfrequencies vanishes, leading to amplification. Building on this, we extend our analysis to a periodic array to investigate the effect of the interplay between temporal modulation and lattice resonances. In contrast to isolated scatterers, the collective nature of lattice resonances introduces a markedly more intricate spectral dependence of the amplification regime. Notably, this amplification emerges at substantially lower modulation strengths, facilitated by the enhanced light-matter interaction and increased lifetime provided by these collective resonances. Our work establishes a simple theoretical framework for understanding collective lattice resonances in time-modulated arrays, enabling dynamic control and amplification of these modes."}

In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite."}

Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable."}

Yet, their coherence properties in the more accessible regime of non-resonant excitation (or photoluminescence) has not been extensively characterized. Here, we investigate the coherence and spectral diffusion of the photoluminescence from a B center in the continuous wave regime using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy. We determine that the emission lineshape consists in a homogeneous contribution, whose linewidth increases with the laser power, and which is broadened by spectral diffusion at a timescale of 10 to 100 microseconds. At low power and short time, the emission line is only a factor ~2 above the Fourier limit, while at long times, the inhomogeneous linewidth increases up to more than a gigahertz.

Employing the LHCb vertex locator as a case study we investigate a novel approach for charged particle track reconstruction. The algorithm hinges on minimizing an Ising-like Hamiltonian using matrix inversion. Solving this matrix inversion classically achieves reconstruction efficiencies akin to current state-of-the-art algorithms. Exploiting the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm for linear systems holds the promise of an exponential speedup in the number of input hits over its classical counterpart, contingent on the conditions of efficient quantum phase estimation (QPE) and effectively reading out the algorithm's output. This contribution builds on previous work by Nicotra et al and strives to fulfill these conditions and further streamlines the algorithm's circuit depth by a factor up to $10^4$. Our version of the HHL algorithm restricts the QPE precision to one bit, largely reducing circuit depth and addressing HHL's readout issue. Furthermore, this allows for the implementation of a post-processing algorithm that reconstructs event Primary Vertices (PVs). The findings presented here aim to further illuminate the potential of harnessing quantum computing for the future of particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics."}

Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable."}

We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs.
