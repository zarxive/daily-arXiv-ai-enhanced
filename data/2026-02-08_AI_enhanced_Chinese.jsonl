In this work, we demonstrate that performing a Legendre transformation of the black hole on-shell action is equivalent to imposing different boundary conditions on the fields. Consequently, the choice of ensemble must be consistent with, and cannot contradict, the imposed boundary conditions. From this perspective, it follows that for four-dimensional dyonic black holes, the on-shell action can only be expressed either as a function of the electric charge and the magnetic potential, or alternatively as a function of the magnetic charge and the electric potential. Inspired by the Legendre transformation of the Maxwell field, we argue that for purely gravitational theories whose metric geometries admit a \\(U(1)\\) fiber bundle structure, i.e.\\ rotating, boosted, or Kaluza-Klein monopole configurations, one can similarly introduce appropriate Legendre terms, in the sense of dimensional reduction, to modify the thermodynamic ensemble of the black hole.

Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $\u03c7^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized.

Here we show that a response-based diagnostic of effective non-Hermiticity can be formulated using minimal pseudo-Lorentz-symmetry-breaking deformations, which separate observables that remain captured by parameter redefinitions from those that exhibit irreducible NH structure. For a two-dimensional NH Dirac semimetal in the weak-NH, real-spectrum regime, we analyze Dirac-cone tilt and velocity anisotropy and compute representative probes of spectral structure, quantum geometry, optical response, and viscoelasticity at zero temperature. We find that tilt yields an NH-dependent slope of the density of states that cannot be collapsed to a single effective velocity, while velocity anisotropy can be captured by effective-velocity reparametrization. Furthermore, the quantum metric and collisionless optical conductivities provide NH-insensitive benchmarks (with the nonlinear conductivity symmetry selected), whereas the shear viscosity offers a discriminator through its tensor structure.

We study this effect for type II string compactifications on general Calabi--Yau manifolds, focusing on vector-multiplet trajectories whose endpoints exhibit axionic shift symmetries. This comprises field excursions of both finite- and infinite distance, but the latter display specific features due to the appearance of light towers of extremal BPS states, in agreement with Swampland principles. We show that vector multiplets split into two sets: those with gravitational and with rigid mutual interactions, and that only a subset of the latter -- dubbed core RFT -- can fully decouple from gravity. We characterise the core RFT in terms of the axionic shift symmetry, and derive decoupling criteria based on kinetic and Pauli interaction mixing. Our framework is illustrated in large complex structure, conifold-like, and Seiberg--Witten limits. In the last case, Pauli mixing obstructs decoupling whenever the dyonic and extremal BPS towers appear at the same scale.

Abdullaev"], "title": "Josephson Dynamics of 2D Bose-Einstein Condensates in Dual-Core Trap: Homogeneous, Droplet-Droplet, and Vortex-Vortex Regimes", "comment": "17 pages, 19 figures", "summary": "The dynamics of a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate mixture, loaded into a dual-core trap, when beyond-mean-field effects are taken into account, are considered. The effects of quantum fluctuations are described by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction terms in the extended coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The spatially uniform and inhomogeneous BEC cases are studied. In the first case, the parameter regimes associated with macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping, and revival-like localisation dynamics are found. The Josephson oscillation frequencies for both the zero-phase and the $\u03c0$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the dynamics exhibit a nontrivial bifurcation structure: along the zero-phase branch, two pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\u03c0$-phase branch shows a single pitchfork bifurcation. In the second case, the Josephson dynamics for quantum droplets and vortices are investigated. Predictions for the oscillation frequencies of the atomic population between quantum droplets are obtained and fully validated by direct numerical simulations of coupled extended GP equations. The existence of the Andreev-Bashkin nondissipative drag through simulations of droplet-droplet interactions is shown. The Josephson dynamics of vortex states are studied. Vortices with topological charge $S$ and sufficiently small particle number are typically unstable, breaking up into $S+1$ (occasionally $S+2$) fundamental fragments, with the breakup time increasing as the particle number grows. Unstable asymmetric vortices show splitting and/or crescent-like instability. For vortices with sufficiently large norms, long-time simulations confirm robust stability against small perturbations; in this regime, Josephson oscillations and Andreev-Bashkin-type entrainment for vortex states with charges $S=1, 2$, and $3$ are investigated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u7ef4\u73bb\u8272\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u5728\u53cc\u901a\u9053 traps \u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u5076\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u8026\u5408 Gross-Pitaevskii \u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u5300\u548c\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b8f\u89c2\u91cf\u5b50\u96a7\u7a7f\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86 Josephson \u632f\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u7684\u96f6\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c \u03c0\u76f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u539f\u5b50\u603b\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5c94\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u548c\u73af\u5f62\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u677e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u548c Andreev-Bashkin \u65e0\u8017drag \u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u73af\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u73af\u5f62\u8d8a\u5bb9\u6613\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8026\u5408 Gross-Pitaevskii \u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u7ef4\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u5c94\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u677e\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5b64\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u73af\u5f62\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u7ef4\u53cc\u901a\u9053 traps \u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Using linear chains of up to nine \\Ca ions and six \\Sr ions, we demonstrate improved stability as a function of the number of ions that are contributing to the laser frequency stabilization servo. The measured joint fractional frequency stability of the two clocks reaches $1.37(12)\\times 10^{-15}$ at one second, placing an upper bound on the same stability of one of the clocks at $9.6(8)\\times 10^{-16}$ in one second. We measured the frequency ratio of the two clocks to be $R_{\\text{Sr/Ca}}=1.082076536381896986(18)$, where the systematic uncertainty is primarily limited by the room temperature blackbody radiation. Our direct measurement represents an order of magnitude improvement compared to existing indirect frequency ratio measurements. Furthermore, by combining our results with recent absolute frequency measurements of the \\Sr transition, referenced to a primary frequency standard, we refined the absolute frequency of the \\Ca transition to $\u03bd_{\\text{Ca}^+}=411042129776400.21(4)$ Hz, reducing its uncertainty by a factor of three.

Speckle is the complex interference wave-field produced by a random distribution of un-resolved scatterers. In this paper, we show how these scatterers can be used as virtual microphones to monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of a wave-packet inside the medium. To do so, the concept of matrix imaging is particularly useful. It consists in decoupling the location of the transmitted and received focal spots in a standard beamforming process. By scanning the wave-field with the output focal spot that then acts as a virtual transducer, one can image the spatio-temporal evolution of the wave-packet inside the medium. This unique observable will allow us to highlight the imperfections of the focusing process, in particular the defocus and reverberations induced by a strong aberrating layer. As a proof-of-concept, we will consider ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms. In the next two papers, we will show how this observable can be leveraged to compensate for these phenomena that hamper wave focusing and imaging in all fields of wave physics. Our method is indeed broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.", "AI": {"tldr": " brief summary of the research abstract.", "motivation": " exploring the use of speckle in imaging for wave physics.", "method": " analyzing matrix imaging for speckle-based wavefield monitoring.", "result": " success in imaging spatio-temporal wave packet evolution and identifying focusing imperfections like defocus and reverberations.", "conclusion": " opens possibilities to improve wave focusing and imaging across various wave types beyond ultrasound using the same multi-element approach."}}

In this review, we survey the recent progress in QD-based entangled photon sources, highlighting the conceptual evolution from the established biexciton-exciton cascade to the emerging paradigm of spontaneous two-photon emission. We further examine how advances in nanophotonic architectures and coherent control strategies are redefining fundamental performance limits, enabling concurrent improvements in source brightness, coherence, and entanglement fidelity.

The tidal interaction is resonantly amplified as the orbital frequency approaches the NS fundamental mode (f-mode) frequency. It has been shown that the exclusion of tidal resonance in parameter estimation leads to a significant bias in the inferred NS tidal deformability and hence the NS EoS [Pratten et al. PRL 129, 081102 (2022)]. The strength and location of tidal resonance depend sensitively on the f-mode frequency, which is typically modeled using its universal relation with the tidal deformability that is derived for an isolated, non-spinning NS assuming only linear fluid perturbations. In a BNS inspiral, the f-mode frequency can be corrected by at least three known effects: nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, and relativity. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the systematic bias on tidal deformability when each frequency correction is ignored. Our study considers both loud, individual events and the stacking of a population of detections. Both scenarios are expected when the next-generation detectors are available with a sensitivity level increased by about an order of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tidal interaction in BNS systems can influence gravitational wave signals and help constrain neutron star properties, but neglecting resonance can introduce significant bias in measurements.", "motivation": "Understanding neutron star properties and equations of state is crucial for astrophysics and gravitational wave astronomy.", "method": "Used Gravitational wave signal analysis, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations, and models of f-mode frequency corrections.", "result": "Ignoring tidal resonance causes bias in tidal deformability and NS equation of state estimation.", "conclusion": "Accounting for tidal resonance and nonlinear effects is essential for accurate NS physics modeling."}}

Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2. Considering large spin probes can achieve a larger quantum Fisher information, offering enhanced metrological advantage, we here utilize the entanglement between a large spin probe and an ancilla to achieve optimal quantum Fisher information for estimating the rotation angle, without prior knowledge of the rotation axis. Different from the previous spin-1/2 case, achieving the optimal precision with large spins generally requires post-selection, resulting in a success probability dependent on the dimension of the Hilbert space.

Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference.

This nanoscale effect is then applied to explain the negative resistance switching (reset) mechanism in filamentary metal oxide resistive switching memory devices (memristors). Previous explanations for the negative resistive switching mechanism state that diffusion constitutes the radial driving mechanism for oxygen ions, and drift under electric fields is restricted to the direction parallel to current flow. This explanation conflicts with retention and microscopy data collected in a subset of devices presented in literature. We demonstrate that the electric field's dependency on the on the radius of a nanoscale conductive path can result in radial fields on the order of 10^5 to 10^6 V/cm at only -1 V bias, sufficient to govern the negative resistance switching mechanism in filamentary metal oxides. By accounting for this nanoscale size effect, long standing anomalous experimental data about the negative (reset) resistance switching mechanism in bipolar filamentary resistive memory devices is finally reconciled.

We perform two complementary analyses: (1) comparing relativistic corrections computed at both the Hartree-Fock (HF) and coupled cluster CCSD(T) levels to assess how correlation influences the magnitude of relativistic corrections, and (2) comparing correlation corrections computed within both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks to determine how relativity influences the magnitude of correlation corrections.\n  Our results reveal a striking non-linear relationship between these two effects. Specifically, the combined effect of relativity and correlation on ionization energy does not equal the sum of their individual contributions. This non-additivity indicates that relativistic and correlation effects are not independent; they interact in complex ways that depend on the atomic system. We find that for some atoms, the two effects enhance each other, while for others they partially cancel.

An iterative phase reversal process operated from the space-time Fourier space is then used to compensate for reverberations and optimize both the axial and transverse resolution of the confocal image.

This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform.

Unlike the Schwarzschild case, two new features can arise in black holes with two horizons: an apparent-horizon left vertex, a temporary minimum in the apparent-horizon radius during collapse, and a bounce, where the star surface stops collapsing at a nonzero radius and reverses into expansion. We identify the conditions that lead to these two features. For two-horizon exteriors, trapped-region consistency requires that the apparent-horizon turning point occurs no earlier than the surface crossing of the inner horizon. As a concrete example, the OS collapse of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m (RN) spacetime shows both effects. In contrast, regular black holes with de Sitter cores show neither: their collapse is smooth and monotonic, and the surface approaches the center only as the proper time goes to infinity. These results naturally classify the OS collapses into three categories: singular, which ends at the center in finite time; bouncing, which reverses at a finite radius; and soft-landing, which reaches the center only asymptotically.

The recently developed Infinity-RETIS algorithm boosts parallel efficiency through asynchronous replica exchanges in the infinite-swap limit, eliminating the wall-time bottlenecks of conventional RETIS. This approach introduces fractional samples and biased sampling distributions, requiring a generalized path reweighting framework, for which we derive expressions demonstrating how it can be used to compute exact dynamic and thermodynamic variables.

These conditional free energies can reveal kinetically relevant barriers even with suboptimal reaction coordinates and therefore provide a rigorous and versatile tool for characterizing complex molecular transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents an advanced method for calculating rare event rates using TIS and RETIS algorithms, enhanced by path reweighting and the Infinity-RETIS algorithm to compute various thermodynamic and kinetic quantities.", "motivation": "Understanding rare events in molecular systems is crucial for fields like chemistry and biology, and traditional MD simulations often fail to capture these events efficiently.", "method": "The paper introduces the Infinity-RETIS algorithm, which improves the efficiency of replica exchange by implementing asynchronous exchanges in the infinite-swap limit, allowing for more accurate calculations of path ensembles and thermodynamic properties.", "result": "The generalized path reweighting framework developed enables the computation of exact dynamic and thermodynamic variables, and an analytical approach is used to calculate conditional free energy surfaces influenced by kinetic factors like particle mass and friction.", "conclusion": "This method provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex molecular systems and understanding the role of kinetic factors in transitions between metastable states."}}

These dynamics can often be extracted from a two-dimensional trace consisting of a set of nonlinear spectra, using an iterative algorithm. Typically, the measurement of this trace requires integrating the signal of many pulses, which implies that the trace does not correspond to a single pulse when shot-to-shot variations occur. In this case, the pulse train can be characterized statistically, by a base pulse and a metric that quantifies the instabilities. Here, we demonstrate that the amplitude swing technique is sensitive to instabilities, which manifest as two distinct imprints on the measurement. First, we analyze the terms that compose the amplitude swing signal. Then, we study two parameters to quantify the instabilities, related to a shift in the minima of the trace marginal, and to the filling of the trace minima zones, respectively.

The holographic volume provides a notion of system size, allowing extensivity to be defined in standard thermodynamic terms, and it yields a definition of the large-system limit. For the asymptotically flat case, we show that, in the canonical thermodynamic representation, small Schwarzschild black holes are non-extensive, whereas large black holes become extensive in the large-system limit. A similar conclusion applies to Anti-de-Sitter Schwarzschild black holes, with the difference that the quasi-local energy of the large black hole also becomes extensive in the large-system limit. Before this limit, the energy decomposes into subextensive and extensive contributions, and we derive an explicit expression for the extensive part as a function of the finite volume and entropy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Black holes have size-dependent thermodynamic properties (pressure and volume), which enable extensivity only in a large-system limit.

We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although nonlinear interaction is essential for generating entanglement, during signal accumulation, it becomes detrimental and therefore must be suppressed. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation (AIQM) scheme, designed to operate under a fixed nonlinear interaction. During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations.

In these points, the SCISSOR supports high task-performance, opening novel strategies for future on-chip training.

Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations.

Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5728hboronnitride\uff08hbn\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u5ba4\u957f\u58f0\u8154\uff08cavity-QED\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2ahbn\u8272\u5fc3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u58f0\u6e90\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8d85\u53cc\u6781\u5149\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53cc\u6781\u5149-\u91cf\u5b50\u7269 coupling\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u5927\u6ce2\u6bb5\u548c\u77ed\u6ce2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5149\u5b50ics\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u5e73\u53f0\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u8272\u5fc3\u751f\u6210\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8d85\u53cc\u6781\u5149\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u58f0\u8154\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5149\u5b50ics\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728hbn\u8272\u5fc3\u548c\u8d85\u53cc\u6781\u5149\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5f15\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5076\uff08QED\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u53d7\u6fc0\u8f90\u5c04\u5230\u58f0\u5b50\u8fb9\u5e26\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u662f\u53d7\u6fc0\u53d1\u66fc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53cc\u53d1\u5c04\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u4e2a\u6781\u5149\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53cc\u6781\u5149\u548chbn\u8272\u5fc3\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u58f0\u8154\u91cf\u5b50\u6e90\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u58f0\u8154\u5728\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5149\u6805\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u5b50ics\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u53cc\u6781\u5149\u4e0ehbn\u8272\u5fc3\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u6805\u58f0\u8154\u548c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3acoupling\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u5b50ics\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Using a hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer, we map the photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise over an order of magnitude in probe power and a factor of three in pump power while remaining quantum-noise-limited. We observe linear, quadratic, and cubic scaling of the respective total noise powers with probe photon flux, together with a quadratic dependence of back-action on pump photon flux, in quantitative agreement with a stochastic Bloch-equation model. At higher probe powers, additional probe-induced relaxation modifies the spin-noise spectrum while preserving the integrated noise scaling.

This intriguing result has been interpreted by some authors as arising from essentially replacing the black hole's effective potential and its perturbation with two disjoint potential barriers. We argue that such an analysis may have oversimplified the real physical scenario. To be more precise, a metric perturbation planted farther away from the black hole horizon might not always be appropriately approximated by a disjoint minor barrier. Particularly, for the perturbed P\u00f6schl-Teller potential, joint and disjoint metric perturbations might lead to drastically different stability properties for the low-lying modes. Following this line of thought, this study conducts a refined analysis of the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential by closely examining a few physically relevant ingredients. While our analysis qualitatively confirms the main findings of previous studies, as the stability of the fundamental mode is primarily determined by the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency, we show that specific features of both the effective potential at spatial infinity and the metric perturbation can have a sizable impact on the instability. In contrast, the spiral period, governed by the real part of the quasinormal frequency, appears largely insensitive to the details of the black hole metric or its perturbations. The analytic estimates are in reasonable agreement with the numerical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u9ad8\u65af\u5ea6\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u7684Rege-Wheeler\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u58f0\u5b66\u53ef\u80fd\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u7406\u60c5\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u539f\u56e0\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u58f0\u5b66\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76P\u00f6schl-Teller\u52bf\u7684\u8054\u5408\u548c\u5206\u7acb\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u539f\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u57fa\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7quasinormal\u9891\u7387\u7684\u865a\u90e8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u90e8\u5219\u53d7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ec6\u8282\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5ea6\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u591a\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Although heat transport is dominated by phonons, moderate magnetic fields generate a thermal Hall ratio ($\u03ba_{xy}/\u03ba_{xx}$) above 2\\%, an unprecedented value for a nonmagnetic material. The transverse thermal conductivity $\u03ba_{xy}$ exhibits a pronounced maximum in fields of a few Tesla.

This study proposes a novel technique for engineering the field of view of an optical system without compromising the magnification. In the proposed method, an object response pattern is recorded on a camera by introducing a coded phase mask (CPM) in the imaging system. The coded phase mask is a multiplexing of N distinct scattering phases, where N-1 represents the number of isolated object areas to be brought within the field of view. Each scattering phase yields a point spread function of a unique sparse dot pattern on the camera. With the introduction of a coded phase mask, the objects' images are brought within the region of the camera sensor, which, without the CPM, would have remained outside the inherent field of view of the system.

We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop.

While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8df3\u8dc3\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u662f\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u51bb\u7ed3\u548c\u91cf\u5b50Zeno\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f6c\u53d8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8dc3\u8fc1\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e isset \u6b27\u6d32\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u8c03\u6574\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u548c\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.

We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \\sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems.

The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole. We consider two microscopic models: a spinless two-band model describing a band inversion of $s$ and $d$ states, and a Lieb lattice model with collinear N\u00e9el order. The latter is a prototypical minimal model for altermagnetism in 2D and is realized in a number of recently proposed material compounds, which are discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We explicitly utilize the single-cut discontinuity relations, or cutting rules, involving the cosmological correlators recently constructed in arXiv:2512.20720. For diagrams with multiple interaction vertices, we apply the dispersion formula by cutting all internal lines in the diagram one by one, successively, thereby allowing us to reconstruct the full correlator using only lower-point contact-level objects and their discontinuity data, up to contact diagram ambiguities. We also rediscover how the cosmological correlators on the late-time slice of de Sitter space can be obtained from flat-space Feynman diagrams via a set of dressing rules. Our starting point, being the cutting rules for the cosmological correlators, also emphasizes how basic principles, such as unitarity for in-in correlators, can lead us to the dressing rules, which were previously derived in literature following a different method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges associated with propagation loss, limited nonlinearity, and susceptibility to nanoscale fabrication imperfections prevent them from competing with conventional bulk and fiber-based OPAs. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient integrated OPAs with continuous-wave net gain. The pump efficiency is improved by over one order of magnitude. Phase-sensitive gain of 23.5 dB is demonstrated, significantly exceeding previous integrated OPAs, using only 110 mW pump power and no cavity enhancement. This is achieved with parametric down-conversion in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides using the adapted poling technique to maintain the coherence of nonlinear interactions. Moreover, the high parametric gain exceeds fibre-chip-fibre losses, leading to appreciable net gain up to 10 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 120 nm, covering telecommunication S-, C-, and Lbands. Quantum-limited noise performance is confirmed through the measurement of output field fluctuation below the classical limit. We further demonstrate that signalto-noise ratio in noisy optical communications can be increased by leveraging this efficient integrated OPA.

Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG.

We define Mellin amplitudes with $n$ spinning operators via the so-called \"scaffolding\" of $2n$-scalar ones with specific projection operators for each spin state, which are rational functions of Mellin variables of $2n$ scalars generalizing flat-space scaffolding amplitudes. We classify possible three-point structures with spin 1 and 2 which take the same form as massive three-point amplitudes in flat space, and match with special solutions such as those extracted from 6-scalar ones in $\\mathrm{AdS}_5\\times S^3$ or $\\mathrm{AdS}_5\\times S^5$. Focusing on $\\mathrm{AdS}_5$ gluons, we directly bootstrap spinning amplitudes in scaffolding form up to $n=6$ gluons (which amounts to $2n=12$ scalars) using factorizations, multi-linearity and flat-space limit. The results take a remarkably simple form in analogy with flat-space amplitudes, which can be constructed from familiar 3- and 4-vertices as well as propagators of massive spin-1 particles.

Simulations for a dissipative photosynthetic aggregate reveal the superior ability of entangled photon pairs, compared to both transform-limited and frequency-chirped laser pulses, to manipulate excited-state absorption pathways. The corresponding spectral features in the two-dimensional spectrogram are interpreted in terms of one- and two-exciton resonances.

Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$.

In this paper we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of alpha sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe. The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and does not carry any quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates classical ensemble data with the quantum mechanics experienced by bulk observers and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of \"It from Bit\". We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent proposals using qubits encoded in frequency modes promise a large reduction in hardware footprint, and have garnered much attention.

In this work, we present designs of frequency-mode beam splitters based on modulated arrays of coupled resonators. We develop a methodology to construct their effective transfer matrices based on the SLH formalism for quantum input-output networks. Our methodology is flexible and highly composable, allowing us to define $N$-mode beam splitters either natively based on arrays of $N$-resonators of arbitrary connectivity or as networks of interconnected $l$-mode beam splitters, with $l<N$. We apply our methodology to analyze a two-resonator device, a frequency-domain phase shifter and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer obtained from composing these devices, a four-resonator device, and present a formal no-go theorem on the possibility of natively generating certain $N$-mode frequency-domain beam splitters with arrays of $N$-resonators.", "AI": {"tldr": " papers propose that encoding qubits in frequency modes potentially drastically reduces the hardware footprint of photonic quantum computers.

However, population transfer with high performance across a broad frequency range is still challenging due to the finite Rabi coupling strength limited by laser powers. Here we propose a novel population-transfer scheme by suturing adiabatic control pulses with each pulse covering certain frequency interval, which are connected in a way that neighboring adiabatic pulses have opposite chirping directions. Taking the widely utilized hyperbolic-square-hyperbolic pulse as an example, we demonstrate that rapid and robust population transfer can be achieved. The transfer bandwidth scales linearly with the number of suture pulses while maintaining high fidelity, even at the suture points where adiabaticity breaks down. Crucially, these pulses can be realized by a single laser by means of temporal multiplexing.

We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size.

While most Barren Plateau analyses focus on single-qubit rotation gates, the gradient behavior of Parameterized Quantum Circuits built from multi-qubit gates remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a general theoretical framework for analyzing the gradient properties of Parameterized Quantum Circuits with multi-qubit gates. Our method generalizes the direct computation framework, bypassing the Haar random assumption on parameters and enabling the calculation of the gradient expectation and variance. We apply this framework to single-layer and deep-layer circuits, deriving analytical results that quantify how gradient variance is co-determined by the size of the multi-qubit gate and the number of qubits, layers, and effective parameters.

Implementing such unitaries on fault-tolerant devices requires first compiling them into a discrete universal gate set, typically Clifford$+T$. Here, we propose a different approach for their synthesis: compile matchgate unitaries using only matchgate gates. To this end, we first show that the matchgate-Clifford group (the intersection of the matchgate and Clifford groups) plus the $\\overline{T}$ gate (a $T$ unitary up to a phase) is universal for the matchgate group. Our approach leverages the connection between $n$-qubit matchgate circuits and the standard representation of $\\mathbb{SO}(2n)$, which reduces the compilation from $2^n\\times 2^n$ unitaries to $2n\\times2n$ ones, thus reducing exponentially the size of the target matrix. Moreover, we rigorously show that this scheme is efficient, as an approximation error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{SO}(2n)}$ incurred in this smaller-dimensional representation translates at most into an $O(n \\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{SO}(2n)})$ error in the exponentially large unitary. In addition, we study the exact version of the matchgate synthesis problem, and we prove that all matchgate unitaries $U$ such that $U\\otimes U^*$ has entries in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}\\big[1/\\sqrt 2,i\\big]$ can be exactly synthesized by a finite sequence of gates from the matchgate-Clifford$+\\overline{T}$ set, without ancillas.

We show that maximally entangled probes are optimal for discriminating two qubit depolarizing channels, with any nonzero entanglement providing an advantage over single-system probes. In contrast, for dephasing channels in arbitrary dimensions, we prove that single-system probe can be optimal and that entanglement offers no improvement, even when the dephasing unitary is generalized. For qubit amplitude-damping channels, we identify distinct noise-dependent regimes in which either single-system probe outperforms maximally entangled probes and vice-versa. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-maximally entangled probes can act as the optimum probe if the noise parameters restricted to certain values in this task. We also present examples of noisy unitary channels for which discrimination is possible using non-maximally entangled probe, while both single-systems and maximally entangled probes fail.

In this thesis, I present my work using nuclear spins to explore these themes.\n  First, I study temporal quantum correlations quantified by the Leggett Garg inequality (LGI) for a qubit evolving under a superposition of unitary operators. Using a three qubit quantum register, we experimentally realized superposed unitaries and observed LGI violations exceeding the maximal quantum bound of 1.5, indicating enhanced non-classicality. Notably, this superposed unitary dynamics also showed improved robustness against decoherence.\n  Next, I investigate Lee Yang zeros, which are zeros of the partition function in the complex plane that reveal thermodynamic behavior near criticality. We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method to determine the full set of Lee Yang zeros of an asymmetric Ising model using a single quantum probe in a three-qubit nuclear spin register. We further showed that the mutual information between the probe and system peaks at times corresponding to these zeros.\n  I then report our study of the quantum Mpemba effect in nuclear spin relaxation, where systems farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to steady state, verified both theoretically and experimentally using NMR. Finally, I discuss our work on entanglement localization and delocalization induced by local interactions, leading to an apparent violation of the quantum data processing inequality.

As a first approach, we apply linear splitting methods to the restricted, continuous equations of motion derived from variational principles. We utilize an exchange interaction Hamiltonian to confirm that the numerical and analytical solutions coincide in the limit of small time steps. The application to different Hamiltonians shows the wide applicability of the method to detect dynamical entanglement. To avoid the derivation of analytical solutions for complex dynamics, we consider variational, numerical integration schemes, introducing a variational discretization for Lagrangians linear in velocities. Here, we examine and compare two approaches: one in which the system is discretized before the restriction is applied, and another in which the restriction precedes the discretization.

After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $\u03b1$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \\sqrt{\\frac{n^3}{2^{\\max\\{\\lfloor (\u03b1-1)/2 \\rfloor},0\\}}}\\cdot\\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $\u03a9( \\frac{n^2}{2^\u03b1} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $\u03a9( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the choice of base material also influences the sensitivity to quasiparticle-induced decoherence. In this study, we investigate quasiparticle tunneling rates in niobium and tantalum-based offset-charge-sensitive qubits. Using a source of thermal radiation, we characterize the sensitivity of either material to infrared radiation and explore the impact of the infrared background through the targeted use of in-line filters in the wiring and ambient infrared absorbers. We identify both radiation channels as significant contributions to decoherence for tantalum but not for niobium qubits and achieve tunneling rates of 100 Hz and 300 Hz for niobium and tantalum respectively upon installation of infrared filters. Additionally, we find a time-dependence in the observed tunneling rates on the scale of days, which we interpret as evidence of slowly cooling, thermally radiating components in the experimental setup.

They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions.

Given access to an unknown channel, a central problem is whether these transformations can be implemented physically with quantum supermaps. While such supermaps are known for unitary operations, the situation for general quantum channels is fundamentally different. In this work, we establish a strict hierarchy of physical realizability for the transposition, complex conjugation, and adjoint transformation of an unknown quantum channel. We present a probabilistic protocol that exactly implements the transpose with a single query. In contrast, we prove no-go theorems showing that neither the complex conjugate nor the adjoint can be implemented by any completely positive supermap, even probabilistically. We then overcome this impossibility by designing a virtual protocol for the complex conjugate based on quasi-probability decomposition, and show its optimality in terms of the diamond norm.

We introduce the thermal-drift channel, a measurement-based operation that implements a tunable nonunitary drift along a chosen Pauli term. Based on this channel, we present a measurement-controlled sampling algorithm that generates thermal states together with their Hamiltonian \"labels\" for general physical models. We prove that the total gate count of our algorithm scales cubically with system size, quadratically with inverse temperature, and as the inverse error tolerance to the two-thirds power, with logarithmic dependence on the allowed failure probability. We also show that the induced label distribution approaches a normal distribution reweighted by the thermal partition function, which makes an explicit trade-off between accuracy and effective range. Numerical simulations for a 2D Heisenberg model validate the predicted scaling and distribution.

Standard quantum error mitigation is typically based on post-processing strategies. In contrast, the present work explores a pre-processing approach, in which the effects of noise are mitigated before performing a measurement on the output state. The main idea is to find an observable $Y$ such that its expectation value on a noisy quantum state $\\mathcal{E(\u03c1)}$ matches the expectation value of a target observable $X$ on the noiseless quantum state $\u03c1$. Our method requires the execution of a noisy quantum circuit, followed by the measurement of the surrogate observable $Y$. The main enablers of our method in practical scenarios are Tensor Networks. The proposed method improves over Tensor Error Mitigation (TEM) in terms of average error, circuit depth, and complexity, attaining a measurement overhead that approaches the theoretical lower bound. The improvement in terms of classical computation complexity is in the order of $\\sim 10^6$ times when compared to the post-processing computational cost of TEM in practical scenarios.

However, the application of quantum algorithms to integer optimization problems remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to integer problems on graphs, with each integer variable encoded in a qudit. We derive a general iterative formula for depth-$p$ QAOA expectation on high-girth $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary size. The cost of evaluating the formula is exponential in the QAOA depth $p$ but does not depend on the graph size. Evaluating this formula for Max-$k$-Cut problem for $p\\leq 4$, we identify parameter regimes ($k=3$ with degree $d \\leq 10$ and $k=4$ with $d \\leq 40$) in which QAOA outperforms the Frieze-Jerrum semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm, which provides the best worst-case guarantee on the approximation ratio. To strengthen the classical baseline we introduce a new heuristic algorithm, based on the degree-of-saturation, that empirically outperforms both the Frieze-Jerrum algorithm and shallow-depth QAOA. Nevertheless, we provide numerical evidence that QAOA may overtake this heuristic at depth $p\\leq 20$.
