While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC.

We find the explicit expressions and the selection rules for these parameters and establish that they can be governed in a predictable way by adjusting the parameters of the multifrequency helical undulator. In particular, the phases of three arbitrary modes admissible by selection rules in the composite state with definite energy can be made arbitrary by tuning the phases of one-frequency undulators comprising the three-frequency one. By solving Diophantine equations, we obtain simple expressions for the complex amplitude of coherent state of photons emitted by a three-frequency helical undulator and for the average number of radiated twisted photons in the case when the ratios of frequencies of the three-frequency undulator are rational numbers.

Starting from the instantaneous condition $\\dot{E}=0$, imposed as a pointwise constraint along a particle trajectory, we obtain a generalized force law that does not assume a specific kinetic-energy function, momentum-velocity relation, or equation of motion. The resulting inertial response naturally decomposes into a component parallel to the acceleration, responsible for changes in kinetic energy, and a transverse component that preserves energy while altering the direction of motion. Imposing rotational equivariance constrains the geometric structure of the force law, while the relativity principle between inertial reference frames further restricts its admissible realizations. In strictly one-dimensional motion, inertial-frame equivalence implies invariance of the total force under inertial boosts; together with local energy conservation, this uniquely fixes the functional form of kinetic energy and momentum. Galilean invariance selects the Newtonian expressions, whereas Lorentz invariance yields the relativistic ones. The framework unifies conservative and non-conservative (yet non-dissipative) dynamics at the single-particle level and clarifies the precise conditions under which energy-based and variational formulations of mechanics are dynamically equivalent.

Here we show that qualitative transitions in intelligence instead arise as dynamical phase transitions governed by collective critical dynamics. Building on a unified dynamical field-theoretic framework for cognition, we demonstrate that progressive collective coupling generated by reentrant mixing drives the system toward an infrared critical regime in which an extensive band of slow collective modes emerges. This spectral condensation reorganizes cognitive dynamics from localized relaxation to coherent motion along emergent low-dimensional manifolds. Through numerical analysis of the time-scale density of states, we identify robust power-law scaling of collective relaxation rates with well-defined critical exponents, placing the system within the universality class of self-organized critical many-body dynamics. Criticality alone would generically lead to instability. We further show that homeostatic regulation introduces a gapped stabilizing direction that protects the collective critical sector, yielding a dynamically maintained meta-stable infrared phase in which long-lived inference trajectories persist without collapse. The coexistence of scale-free collective dynamics and global stabilization defines a protected sector-critical regime in which coherence and internal flexibility coexist.

However, chemical reasoning is inherently continuous and structural, and forcing it into discrete linguistic tokens introduces a fundamental representation mismatch that constrains both efficiency and performance. We introduce LatentChem, a latent reasoning interface that decouples chemical computation from textual generation, enabling models to perform multi-step reasoning directly in continuous latent space while emitting language only for final outputs. Remarkably, we observe a consistent emergent behavior: when optimized solely for task success, models spontaneously internalize reasoning, progressively abandoning verbose textual derivations in favor of implicit latent computation. This shift is not merely stylistic but computationally advantageous. Across diverse chemical reasoning benchmarks, LatentChem achieves a 59.88\\% non-tie win rate over strong CoT-based baselines on ChemCoTBench, while delivering a 10.84$\\times$ average inference speedup.

By invoking Birkhoff's Ergodic Partition Theorem, we show that this scalar function distinguishes dynamical regimes via its power spectral density: for regular motion it converges to a delta function, whereas for chaotic trajectories the spectrum exhibits an inverse power-law $(1/\u03c9)$ driven by the phenomenon of dynamical stickiness. With this approach, we avoid the computation and simulation of the variational equations and the usage of neighboring orbits, making it the simplest geometrical chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian descriptors. Its computational efficiency enables the study of high-dimensional systems and allows the generation of large datasets of classified initial conditions, ideal for training Machine Learning models. We validate these findings using the H\u00e9non-Heiles and the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam systems.

Here, we report the first multiscale mechanical assessment of Diamondiyne-derived architectures by combining quasi-static compression of 3D-printed specimens with reactive molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding atomic-scale models. We generate four geometries (3F, 2F-SY, 4F, and 2F-USY). All structures resulted in lower density in the range of 0.20-0.38 g.cm^-3. Experiments indicate that the symmetric two-sublattice structure (2F-SY) delivers the best performance, reaching a specific yield strength of 5.91 MPa.g^-1cm^-3 and a specific energy absorption of 279 J.g^-1, whereas 2F-USY architecture yielded the lowest values, with 0.77 MPa.g^-1.cm^-3 and 16 J.g^-1. The 4F geometry provided a specific energy absorption of 254 J.g^-1. The structures deformed through geometric collapse and strut buckling, which was due to diagonal shear in 2F-USY and progressive compaction in 2F-SY and 3F. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed these experimental trends and revealed strong directional anisotropy due to the arrangement of interlocked sublattices, with a stiffness of 24.1 GPa along the z-direction in the case of 4F architecture. Overall, Diamondiyne-derived architectures display geometry-dominated mechanical behavior and serve as a promising platform for lightweight, energy-absorbing metamaterials.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Tobar"], "title": "Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear.

These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\\lesssim$ M$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim$\\,7\\,M$_\\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\\lesssim R^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim 24$\\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \\leq$ B$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}} \\leq 10^{16}$\\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a model of a hypermassive, extremely magnetized, ultra-compact quark--gluon plasma (QGP) object supported against gravitational collapse by vacuum polarization and QCD asymptotic freedom.

We provide an efficient data access model to load this infinite linear representation of the nonlinear system, upto truncation order $N$, on a quantum computer by decomposing the Hamiltonian into the weighted sum of non-unitary operators, namely the Sigma basis. We have shown that the Sigma basis provides an exponential reduction in the number of decomposition terms compared to the traditional decomposition, which is usually done in a linear combination of Pauli operators.

Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force.

Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters, incorporating entanglement swapping and entanglement purification with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude.

This work presents an extension of the Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS) Multipole module to include collar and pole regions of accelerator magnets, which influences the overall thermal response. A thermal thin shell approximation (TSA), which is shown to be effective in previous works, is employed to model thermal insulation layers efficiently, replacing an insulation surface mesh. The main novelty of this work lies in the development of a method to model the thermal connection between the magnet winding and the collar and pole regions via the TSA.\n  To assess the accuracy and computational efficiency of the novel method, temperature and field variations are computed for a current ramp-up scenario. The thermal solution is coupled to a fully resolved magnetodynamic solution to capture the interaction between thermal and electromagnetic behaviour. The results obtained with the TSA are then compared to classical finite element (FE) solutions with explicitly meshed insulation domains. The TSA predicts the maximum temperature within 2-4% of the reference solution while substantially reducing mesh complexity and achieving up to a 5 times speed-up in computation time. While the TSA has traditionally been employed for short-duration quench simulations with high heat fluxes between magnet turns, these results demonstrate its reliability and efficiency for current ramp scenarios with low heat fluxes, significantly expanding its application range beyond what has been previously reported in the literature.\n  To illustrate potential applications of this new functionality, conduction cooling through the collar region is studied, comparing different cooling configurations and collar materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u78c1\u68d2\u548c\u652f\u6491\u533a\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5143\u70ed\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u70ed\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528TSA\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u70ed\u7edd\u7f18\u5c42\u7f51\u683c\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u8584\u58f3\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "TSA\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06\u6700\u5927\u6e29\u5ea6\u504f\u79bb\u4e0b\u964d4%\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e29\u5ea6\u573a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7f51\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53475\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86TSA\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u70ed\u6d41\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5ba4\u6e29\u5230\u8fd0\u884c\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

We analyze maximum shear stress in solid-like and fluid-like spheroids: solid-like spheroids exhibit broader stress distributions and radial stress gradients, while fluid-like spheroids show lower stresses with weak spatial organization. Cell shape anisotropy is not generically aligned with principal stress directions, indicating that morphology alone is an unreliable proxy for mechanical state. We further demonstrate strain stiffening at the single-cell level, where elongation produces nonlinear increases in maximum shear stress, allowing boundary cells in otherwise low-stress, fluid-like spheroids to transiently generate forces sufficient to remodel the matrix. To connect strain-induced stress amplification to invasion modes, we introduce an extended 3D vertex model with explicit, tunable cell-cell adhesion springs. In this minimal mechanical framework, single-cell breakout results from strain stiffening combined with reduced adhesion, whereas multi-cell streaming additionally requires anisotropic adhesion strengthened along the elongation axis and weakened orthogonally.

Despite decades of experimental efforts, a direct observation of this emblematic transition for matter waves has remained elusive. Previous attempts with ultracold atoms were hindered by strong and uncontrolled energy broadening, resulting in indirect, sometimes inaccurate, and model-dependent estimates of the mobility edge.

This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u601d\u8def\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\u9003\u9038\u3002", "motivation": "\u5173\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5728XY\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u7c7b\u65f6 horizon\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u5185\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7 horizon\u53d1\u5c04\u81f3\u5916\u90e8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\u9003\u79bb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u3002"}}

This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\\mathcal{C}$ being unitary.

Supporting material 3 pages and 1 figure", "summary": "We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates.

We show that the evolution of such structured states corresponds to an open path in the space of quadratic forms, giving rise to a geometric contribution to the emission amplitude that cannot be eliminated by gauge choice or adiabatic arguments. The inverse radius of curvature of the electron wavefront emerges as an effective geometric field that enables radiation even in regions where the external magnetic field vanishes locally.

Matching to the quadrupolar worldline effective action gives a mode-sum response function and analytic dynamical tidal deformabilities from mode frequencies, normalizations, and overlaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86 barsotropic \u5b8c\u5168\u6d41\u4f53 neutron \u661f\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u5dee\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u6d41\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u4f5c\u7528\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u6d41\u4f53\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5916\u6e90\u548c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u79ef\u5206\u540e\u5f97\u5230 Hermitian \u7b97\u7b26\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u9694\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u79bb\u6563\u8c31\u3002\u5c06\u4f4d\u79fb\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e0a\u5e76\u79ef\u5206\u6389\u661f\u4f53\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7531\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5185\u79ef\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u79ef\u5206\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u632f\u8361\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5339\u914d\u5230\u56db\u6781\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u6a21\u5f0f\u53cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u5dee\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dGR\uff08\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff09\u5f3a\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6d41\u4f53 Love \u6570\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u57a6\u5168\u6d41\u4f53 neutron \u661f\u65f6\u5dee\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f5c\u7528\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u540e\u83b7\u5f97\u6d41\u4f53\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5c06\u6b64\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5916\u6e90\u548c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u79ef\u5206\u51fa Hermitian \u7b97\u7b26\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u9694\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5c06\u4f4d\u79fb\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e0a\uff0c\u79ef\u5206\u6389\u661f\u4f53\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u8c03\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u632f\u8361\u5668\u3002\u5339\u914d\u5230\u56db\u6781\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u53cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u5dee\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e barotropic \u5b8c\u5168\u6d41\u4f53 neutron \u661f\u7684\u4e00\u822cGR\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u5dee\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a Hermitian \u7b97\u7b26\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u9694\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c31\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u79ef\u5206\u6d88\u9664\u661f\u4f53\u534a\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u8c03\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u632f\u8361\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb reacts \u51fd\u6570\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u5dee\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9icies\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 barotropic \u5b8c\u5168\u6d41\u4f53 neutron \u661f\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u5dee\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u65f6\u5dee\u5f39\u6027\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u9891\u7387\u3001\u5f52\u4e00 normalization \u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u79efconfiguration\u3002"}}

By automatically encoding the constraints of conformal symmetry and current conservation, the formalism drastically simplifies these correlators. We show that three-point functions are fixed by little group covariance and take the same form as the corresponding Schwinger-parameterized correlators in twistor space. The power of the Grassmannian approach is especially evident for four-point functions, which require dynamical input beyond kinematics. We demonstrate that unitarity enforces the same factorization properties as for scattering amplitudes and use these to bootstrap the four-point functions in several non-trivial examples, including Yang-Mills theory. We find expressions that are astonishingly simple and reveal a close connection to the corresponding scattering amplitudes. Our results suggest that the Grassmannian provides the natural language for spinning correlators in de Sitter space and illuminates their geometric origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0de Sitter\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u7684\u5171\u53d8\u805a\u96c6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5171\u53d8\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u70b9\u548c\u56db\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56db\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u8d85\u51fa\u5171\u53d8\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5355\u5143\u89c4\u5b9a\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u8303\u4f8b\u7684\u56db\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6768-\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u6781\u5176\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5173\u8054\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b80\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fde Sitter\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u5171\u53d8\u805a\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5171\u53d8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u5b88\u6052\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u6b65\u9aa4\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528Schwinger\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u4e09\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u56db\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5143\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\u7531\u5fae\u5c0f\u7fa4\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0etwistors\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94Schwinger\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u56db\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5143\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u8d28\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u7b80\u6d01\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0e\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u4ea4\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0de Sitter\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u805a\u96c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e09\u70b9\u548c\u56db\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5982\u6768-\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Under a harmonic bias $V(t)=V_\\mathrm{dc}[1-\\cos(\u03a9t)]$, the excess photon-assisted noise exhibits distinct behaviors: for Majorana or quasi-Majorana bound states, it undergoes multiple sign reversals as $V_\\mathrm{dc}$ increases and vanishes at nonzero integer values of $eV_\\mathrm{dc}/\u03a9$ (with $e$ the elementary charge), whereas for zero-energy Andreev bound states--particularly those producing nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peaks--it remains strictly negative over the entire $V_\\mathrm{dc}$ range.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5149\u8f85\u52a9\u96a7\u7a7f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u504f\u7f6e\u7535\u538b\u4e0b\u53d6\u6d88\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728 Majorana \u6216\u51c6-Majorana\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u4e0b\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6b21\u7b26\u53f7\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u96f6\u80fdAndreev\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u4e0b\u5219\u4fdd\u6301\u8d1f\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u504f\u7f6e\u7535\u538b\u5bf9\u53d6\u6d88\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3 Majorana \u548c Andreev \u72b6\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u52a9\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5fae\u6270\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u6c42\u5f97\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u504f\u7f6e\u7535\u538b $V_\text{dc}$ \u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c Majorana \u6216\u51c6-Majorana \u72b6\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d6\u6d88\u566a\u58f0\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6b21\u7b26\u53f7\u53cd\u8f6c\uff1b\u800c\u96f6\u80fd Andreev \u72b6\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d6\u6d88\u566a\u58f0\u4fdd\u6301\u8d1f\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1 Majorana \u7535 Nanowires \u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96f6\u80fd Andreev \u72b6\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u53cd\u5e38\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditionally, these measurements are performed with grating or Fourier-transform spectrometers using incoherent light sources. Leveraging coherent light enables powerful frequency-comb-based techniques, but is limited by the technical complexity of efficiently generating broad spectral bandwidths from relatively narrowband and spectrally distant laser sources. Current visible dual-comb spectrometers require implicit compromises between optical bandwidth, experimental simplicity, and acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient dual-comb spectrometer that converts robust Er:fiber frequency combs from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet and visible with thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides. Using real-time signal processing, we retrieve coherently averaged dual-comb spectra over nearly 120 THz of simultaneous bandwidth in the visible with 100 MHz spectral resolution. With these capabilities, we measure the broadband absorption spectrum of molecular iodine (I2), demonstrating the broadest visible spectral coverage of a dual-comb spectrometer to date. Additional measurements of NO2, atomic rubidium, and atomic sodium further illustrate the achievable combination of spectroscopic bandwidth, resolution, and intrinsic frequency accuracy. Our results demonstrate the powerful integration of low-power frequency combs, nonlinear nanophotonics, and digital signal processing to enable a compact, efficient and versatile approach to high-resolution mapping of complex absorption spectra across 500 THz in the UV-visible and near-infrared spectral regions for multiple applications beyond the research lab", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u3001\u751f\u7269\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5929\u6587\u5b66\uff09\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u53cc\u7ec4\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5168\u606f\u5149\u6805\u6216\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u6e90\u548c\u5168\u606f\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\u53ca\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86120 THz\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5149\u6805\u6216\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5149\u6e90\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u548c\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u606f\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u7ec4\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u5bbd\u5149\u8c31\u5e26\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5229\u7528Er:fiber\u5168\u606f\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u9891\u7387\u68b3\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u533a\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8584\u819c\u785d\u9178\u9502(nanophotonic waveguides)\u5c06\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100 MHz\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u8fd1120 THz\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u7898\u3001\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u6c2e\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u94ef\u548c\u94a0\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5168\u606f\u5149\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u7ec4\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8986\u76d6500 THz\u7684\u8d85\u5e7f\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u7898\u3001\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u6c2e\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u94ef\u548c\u94a0\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7531\u6b64\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u53cc\u7ec4\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u5168\u606f\u5149\u6280\u672f\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u624b\u6bb5\u3002\u5c55\u671b\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5ology\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

This gravitational pair creation corresponds to tunnelling out of a false vacuum. In this work, we study this non-perturbative process using a spacetime resolved numerical approach in the interaction picture. To achieve this, we extend the framework of Computational Quantum Field Theory (CQFT), which allows for efficient numerical time evolution of quantum fields, to spin-$1/2$ fermions in curved spacetime.\n  Using this extended framework, we investigate vacuum excitation of a Dirac field induced by a spacetime-curvature quench. In particular, we evolve the fermionic Minkowski vacuum in a $1\\!+\\!1$-dimensional idealized curved spacetime characterized by a localized ``curvature bump'' generated by a smooth, localized Gaussian deformation of flat spacetime. Vacuum excitation is quantified by computing the fermion--antifermion pair numbers defined with respect to the basis corresponding to flat-spacetime (Minkowski) which is the asymptotic metric corresponding to an observor at infinity.\n  We analyze how the excitation depends on the strength and spatial extent of the curvature deformation and discuss the numerical implementation of CQFT in curved backgrounds.

However, it is often unclear whether the probe is responding to the local electric field or other types of intermolecular interactions, inhibiting interpretation of the frequency and effectiveness as probes. This is especially true of molecules whose vibrational frequencies blueshift instead of the more typical redshift in hydrogen bonding configurations. Here we computationally investigate the causes of redshifting versus blueshifting over a range of vibrational reporters. First, we apply adiabatic energy decomposition analysis to a paradigmatic set of probes, finding that redshifting only occurs when electrostatic interactions are strong enough to overcome the dominant and large blueshifting contribution of Pauli repulsion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that field inhomogeneity can further shift the frequency of many probes substantially to either reinforce or counteract the shift expected from a homogeneous field. We find that redshifting is reinforced by electric field inhomogeneity, otherwise field inhomogeneity further weakens the electrostatic contribution relative to Pauli repulsion, leading to blueshifting. Further calculations indicate that the probe's response to field inhomogeneity can be understood by considering the mass of the atoms involved in the stretching mode and sign of the electric field.

As a concrete resource-theoretic application, we implement magic resource (mana) harvesting with a qutrit probe.

Heterostructuring and functionalization of magnetic oxides have been very popular due to their versatility and readiness for integration in modern electronics. In this study, we provide yet another example of this phenomenology by predicting that an insulating ferromagnetic state can be realized in superlattices of LaMnO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ oriented along the (111) direction. In strike contrast with respect to other orientations, these properties are not of extrinsic origin but arise from the interplay of structural order, strain and quantum confinement. The bandgap is shown to be either direct and indirect, depending on the precise composition, which can be explained in terms of the geometrical properties of (111)-oriented bilayers of LaMnO$_3$. The electronic structure shows narrow bands indicating localized $e_g$ states for all the investigated superlattices. These features and the analysis of the inter-atomic magnetic coupling suggest that the investigated superlattices behave as a Kugel-Khomskii material, at least for the explored compositions.

Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(\u03c6/\u03c6_0) + g$. Through St\u0159eda formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $\u03c3_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields.

Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing.

The procedure is applied to a two-state crossing between pairs of Kramers-restricted doublet states (which can also be considered effectively a four-state crossing). To generate the relevant electronic states, we employ the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method that treats systems with an odd number of electrons. To generate the relevant diabatic states, we employ a two-step optimization over complex-unitary rotations that sequentially maximizes dipole and spin moments through iterative Jacobi sweeps; the resulting update rules are effectively equivalent to those of approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) applied to charge and spin. The method converges rapidly and yields smooth diabatic potential energy surfaces that preserve dipole and spin properties (e.g., a slowly varying pseudospin texture) along the reaction coordinate while maintaining time-reversal symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Two TPV cell architectures were fabricated on p-type, highly doped (10^17 cm-3) Ge substrates, differing only in rear contact configuration. A standard device with a gold rear contact achieves a peak efficiency of 7.3 % and a power density of 1.77 W/cm2 at an emitter temperature of 1480 C, while a PERC-type device reaches 6.3 % efficiency and 1.22 W/cm2 at 1426 C. The superior performance of the standard device is attributed to lower series resistance, whereas the PERC design exhibits slightly higher efficiency at lower emitter temperatures (4.0 % vs. 3.8 % at 1150 C) due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity. A detailed TPV model has been developed and validated across both device architectures. The model identifies out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily caused by strong free-carrier absorption in the highly doped Ge substrate. Using this model, we predict device performance under idealized spectral conditions commonly assumed in prior literature. For a simulated AlN/W spectrally selective emitter, efficiencies as high as 22.3 % at 1800 C are obtained, consistent with previous semi-empirical predictions. In contrast, when previously reported Ge devices are modeled under the realistic graphite emitter spectrum used here, projected efficiencies decrease to as low as 8.1 % at 1480 C.

Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice).

In this work, the influence of such radial asymmetry on QMF operation in the second stability zone is investigated through simulations. Using an existing potential formulation for a radially asymmetric QMF, the stability diagram in the second stability zone is extracted for the first time, revealing a systematic shift of the stability apex with the asymmetry parameter. Radial asymmetry introduces additional multipole components, notably an octupole term whose magnitude scales with the asymmetry parameter and whose sign depends on the DC polarity applied to the displaced rods. Transmission simulations show that the transmission peak shifts in accordance with the displaced stability apex, while the resolution exhibits a strong dependence on both the asymmetry parameter and the DC polarity. Comparable maximum resolution is obtained for inward and outward displacements under suitable polarity configurations, with outward displacement providing higher transmission efficiency due to an increased effective aperture. These results demonstrate that controlled radial asymmetry provides an effective means to tailor the resolution and transmission characteristics of QMFs operating in the second stability zone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u56db\u6781\u8d28\u8c31\u4eea\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7a33\u6001\u533a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f84\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u4f20\u8f93\u5cf0\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u5728\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u8d28\u8c31\u4eea\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u5f84\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u56db\u6781\u8d28\u8c31\u4eea\u7684\u52bf\u573a\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7a33\u6001\u533a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5cf0\u79fb\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u968f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6781\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5f84\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u591a\u6781\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5982\u516b\u6781\u9879\uff0c\u5176\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u7531\u65bd\u52a0\u7684\u76f4\u6d41\u6781\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u5cf0\u968f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5cf0\u503c\u79fb\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6781\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u6781\u6027\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c inward\u548coutward\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46outward\u4f4d\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5f84\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7a33\u6001\u533a\u8d28\u8c31\u4eea\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002"}}

However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus.

In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties.

Using methods inspired by studies of spherical photon orbits around Kerr-Newman black holes, we derive conditions for the existence of such halos. We examine several f(R) gravity models, including quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, cubic, power-law, and hyperbolic forms, and find that multiple photon orbits -- both stable and unstable -- can appear outside the event horizon for certain parameter ranges. These additional orbits (halos) provide new insights into spacetime geometry and potential observational signatures of black holes in modified gravity. We present analytical expressions for the orbital radii, perform a numerical stability analysis, and discuss possible observational implications for black hole shadows. Our results indicate that while the standard Schwarzschild black hole admits only a single unstable light ring, Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes can support an additional outer stable photon orbit (a halo) without triggering a black-hole bomb instability.

Later papers attached additional significance to the ABL rule, including assertions that it supported violations of the uncertainty principle. The present work challenges these claims, as well as subsequent attempts to salvage the original interpretation of the ABL rule. Taking a broader view, this paper identifies a subtle category error at the heart of the ABL rule that consists of confusing observables that belong to a single system with emergent observables that arise only for physical ensembles. Along the way, this paper points out other problems and fallacious reasoning in the research literature surrounding the ABL rule, including the misuse of post-selection, a reliance on pattern matching to classical formulas, and a posture of measurementism that takes experimental data as providing answers to interpretational questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper critiques the ABL rule's role in quantum theory, highlighting errors in its application and misinterpretations of experimental results.", "motivation": "The paper aims to critically analyze and correct misunderstandings surrounding the ABL rule in quantum theory.", "method": "The authors review historical context, identify category errors, and critique methodologies used in interpreting the ABL rule.", "result": "The authors identify specific flaws in the ABL rule's application and misuse of experimental data.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the ABL rule's foundational issues render its application questionable in quantum theory analyses."}}

We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds.

These new methods exploit the spinor behaviour of 2-level systems, whose signature is the change of sign of a quantum state upon a $2\u03c0$ rotation. The spinor behaviour is used to manipulate the phases of single-quantum coherences, in order to prepare a double-quantum precursor state which is rapidly converted into double-quantum coherence by a straightforward $\u03c0/2$ rotation. One set of spinor-based methods exploits symmetry-based pulse sequences, while the other set exploits SLIC (spin-lock-induced crossing), in which the nutation frequency under a resonant radiofrequency field is matched to the spin-spin coupling. A variant of SLIC is introduced which is well-compensated for deviations in the radiofrequency field amplitude.

Magnons can be confined using both static and dynamic methods, often relying on potential wells and barriers to restrict their free propagation and trap them in designated locations. In this review, we will explore the main strategies for magnon confinement and trapping, including: magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin textures (i.e. domain walls, vortices, skyrmions) nanostructured materials (i.e. nanowires, disks, and magnonic crystals), topological states, chiral magnons and flat band formation, induced by dipole-dipole interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

Here we overcome this limitation by using a microresonator-anchored ultrafast sweeping Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser for mid-IR spectroscopy. We introduce a dual-microresonator-anchor approach: a microcomb provides frequency calibration and a high-Q microresonator resolves the instantaneous FDML lasing lineshape. The strategy enables accurate correction of the FDML laser's sweep nonlinearity and broad linewidth in the near-IR, allowing the FDML laser to function as a high-fidelity mid-IR light via difference frequency generation.

Thus, increasing $Omega$ drives the system continuously toward the familiar Landau problem in flat space, with torsion setting the noncommutativity scale and controlling the approach to the Landau limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5747\u5300\u626d\u7ed3\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u81ea\u7531\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7a7a\u95f4\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u53d8\u80fd\u91cf\u8c31\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d Defects \u548c torsion \u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76 Defects\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c Landau \u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u7cfb\u7efc Landau \u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7535\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u548c\u5747\u5300\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u626d\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u4e86\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u5e73\u5c55\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6781\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165 Uniform Torsion \u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5e76\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach.

We investigate a quantum-classical approach based on the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), which interleaves shallow QAOA layers with variable elimination guided by measured single- and two-qubit correlators. For interference-aware channel assignment, we give a compact QUBO/Ising formulation in which pairwise interference induces same-channel couplings and one-hot constraints are enforced via quadratic penalties (or, optionally, constraint-preserving mixers). Within RQAOA, fixing high-confidence variables or relations reduces the problem dimension, stabilizes training, and concentrates measurement effort on a shrinking instance that is solved exactly once below a cutoff. On simulated instances of modest size, including a four-user, four-channel example, the method consistently returns feasible assignments and, for the demonstrated case, attains the global optimum.

By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation.

In this work, we present a comprehensive longitudinal characterization of 27 frequency-tunable transmon qubits spanning over one year across four thermal cycles. Our results establish a distinct hierarchy of stability for superconducting hardware. We find that the intrinsic device parameters determining the qubit frequency and the baseline energy relaxation times ($T_1$) exhibit high robustness against thermal stress, characterized by frequency deviations typically confined within 0.5\\% and non-degraded coherence baselines. In stark contrast, the environmental variables, specifically the background magnetic flux offsets and the microscopic landscape of two-level system (TLS) defects, undergo a significant stochastic reconfiguration after each cycle. By employing frequency-dependent relaxation spectroscopy and a quantitative metric, the $T_1$ Spectral Topography Fidelity, we demonstrate that thermal cycling acts as a ``hard reset'' for the local defect environment.

Originally conceived to elucidate the physics of a molecular chain of polyacetylene, this model has found widespread applications in exploring a wide range of topological phenomena in photonics and beyond.

Our discussion highlights demonstrated examples, such as the nonlinear tuning of topological states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian photonic SSH lattices, as well as nonlinear harmonic generation and topological lasing in SSH-type photonic microstructures. We further discuss characteristic topological phenomena in other representative 1D settings, including Floquet systems, topological pumping, quasicrystals, and synthetic non-Hermitian systems. Finally, we examine selected examples of two-dimensional (2D) photonic topological crystalline insulators that are closely linked to the SSH model.

Beyond Second Order Perturbations", "comment": "44 p, no figures", "summary": "Black hole perturbation theory beyond second order is not well understood because typically one defines the meaning of gauge invariance order by order which is ambiguous. In this series of works we therefore developed a new approach which disentangles the meaning of gauge invariance from the perturbative order. It is based on the reduced phase space approach to the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity and constructs a non-perturbative, albeit implicit, formulation of the dynamics of only observables that are gauge invariant to all orders. To obtain explicit expressions, perturbation theory is then employed, but now only perturbations are considered that are gauge invariant to all orders. There are both spherically symmetric and non-symmetric observables and the formulation takes the (perturbative) backreaction between those fully into account. The formulation has access to both the exterior and interior of the dynamical horizon.\n  In previous papers of this series we have introduced the general formalism and performed consistency checks with second order results obtained in other approaches. The real virtue of our approach starts emerging at higher than second order where we expect differences from previous works both due to backreaction effects and because we work with observables that are gauge invariant to all orders, not only up to a given order. In this paper, we consider the third order. Also new to our approach is that we start from a non-perturbative, namely polynomial, version of the constraints which therefore are finite polynomials in all degrees of freedom before reducing, rather than an infinite series. This allows for an exact and non-perturbative, while implicit, solution of the constraints which does not need to truncate the series and thus is of tremendous technical advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u5947\u70b9\u89c2\u5bdf\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6444\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0e\u524d\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u80cc\u53cd\u5e94\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6311\u6218\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5f00\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u65e0\u5947\u70b9\u89c2\u5bdf\u91cf\u6784\u9020\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u9ad8\u9636\u6444\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86gauge\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u5e76\u4e14\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u540c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6270\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, achieving this goal is currently hindered by the stringent requirement for an ultrahigh mechanical quality factor ($Q_c$). Here, we propose a dual-channel cooling scheme based on squeezing-enhanced quantum interference within a hybrid levitated cavity-magnomechanical system to overcome this limitation.\n  By synergizing squeezing effects with quantum interference between the magnon-CM and cavity-CM channels, our scheme simultaneously suppresses Stokes (heating) scattering while enhancing anti-Stokes (cooling) scattering.~We demonstrate that this cooling mechanism reduces the critical $Q_c$ required for ground-state cooling by three orders of magnitude, making it achievable in the experimentally accessible regime of $Q_c \\sim 10^4$. Furthermore, the net cooling rate is enhanced by nearly 180-fold compared to that of conventional single-channel cooling.

To meet this need, Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has emerged as a noncontact, high-resolution elastography tool that probes the GHz-frequency longitudinal modulus of materials. This longitudinal modulus reflects both elastic and viscous behavior at microscopic scales. However, interpreting Brillouin spectra in biological specimens is challenging: in highly hydrated samples the Brillouin shift is dominated by water dynamics, and the GHz longitudinal modulus does not directly equate to conventional low-frequency stiffness measures (e.g. Young's or shear moduli). Debates remain about how hydration and polymer relaxation influence the Brillouin signal, and how to relate it to macroscopic biomechanics. In particular, the longitudinal viscosity measured by Brillouin scattering includes a contribution from bulk viscosity, which is absent in standard shear rheology and often overlooked. To address these issues, we used different hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures to show Brillouin spectra are modulated but not dominated by hydration. By varying gelatin concentration, we demonstrated that Brillouin shifts can either positively or negatively correlate with water content, depending on the underlying mechanical response. Measurements on ethanol water mixtures further clarify this behavior. Although the Brillouin shift varies strongly with composition, it does not follow water content monotonically and instead reflects changes in the mixture's mechanical properties.

Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons.

They have demonstrated notable improvements in thresholds and scaling in surface and Floquet code memories. In this work, we use erasure qubits on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes from the quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) regime. Owing to their sparse structure and favorable rate-distance trade-offs, BB codes are practical candidates for QEC. We introduce BiBiEQ, a novel framework that compiles a given BB code into an erasure-aware memory circuit C_E. This erasure circuit C_E comprises erasure checks (ECs), resets, and erasures spread over a user-specified erasure check schedule (2EC, 4EC). BiBiEQ converts this erasure circuit C_E into the stabilizer circuit C for general-purpose decoding. BiBiEQ provides two engines for this conversion, BiBiEQ-Exact and BiBiEQ-Approx. BiBiEQ-Exact preserves the joint-erasure correlations and serves as our accuracy benchmark, while BiBiEQ-Approx uses an independence approximation to accelerate large sweeps and expose accuracy-throughput trade-offs. Using BiBiEQ, we decode the stabilizer circuits to get a per-round logical error rate (LER) for the BB codes and quantify the effect of the EC schedules on the correctable operating region below the pseudo-threshold. The 4EC schedule keeps the accuracy of both engines close to one another, making BiBiEQ-Approx a reliable proxy for BiBiEQ-Exact for faster sweeps. Below the pseudo-threshold, the code distance (d) hop from distance (d) 6 to 10 yields a drop in LER by 10-17x larger than distance (d) 10 to 12, showing that most gains are realized by d=10.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The optical interposer incorporates low-loss SiON photonic circuits to realize scalable waveguide routing and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) with polarization-insensitive operation and high fabrication tolerance, while supporting flip-chip integration with InP-based active devices, including electro-absorption modulated lasers (EMLs) and photodetectors (PDs). Based on this architecture, a 400-Gb/s single-fiber optical transceiver is implemented and experimentally evaluated. Clear eye diagrams and high receiver sensitivity demonstrate reliable high-speed data transmission, which offers scalable, high-bandwidth optical I/Os in future high-performance computational clusters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cdSiON/Si\u57fa\u5149\u7ea4\u4ea4\u63d2\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u4f4e\u635f\u8017\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6e29\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0400-Gb/s\u5355\u7ea4\u4f20\u8f93\u5668\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI/ML\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SiON/Si\u57fa\u5149\u7ea4\u4ea4\u63d2\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5229\u7528SiON\u5149\u8def\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u957fmultiplexing\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u5438\u8c03\u5236\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u548c\u5149\u7535\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0400-Gb/s\u5355\u7ea4\u4f20\u8f93\u5668\uff0c\u773c\u56fe\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u63a5\u6536\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c6\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u63a5\u53e3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u4f4e\u635f\u8017\u548c\u9ad8\u6e29\u6548\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e3aAI/ML\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We study the correlation hierarchy in a tripartite state engineered by mixing a two-mode squeezed vacuum with a coherent state on a tritter, a key linear optical element for multimode state generation. Using the covariance matrix formalism, we comprehensively analyze the entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering among the output modes. The strength of both correlations is governed solely by the squeezing parameter and is independent of the coherent amplitude. We further examine the impact of inevitable optical losses in various channel configurations. The results show that while losses degrade correlations, EPR steering remains monogamous and exhibits stricter resilience thresholds than entanglement. Our analysis, supported by parameter extension techniques, confirms that the steering condition is more stringent than the inseparability criterion, clearly demonstrating that steering forms a strict subset of entanglement.

We here study the geometric criticality associated with these eigenstates. The amplitude and phase of the drive serve as the control parameter of the governing Hamiltonian. We find the quantum metric and Berry curvature tensors for each eigenstate display divergent behaviors in the critical region.

Traditional correction methods often require tedious manual calibration or structured light sequences to establish pixel-wise correspondences. In this paper, we develop the Curved Surface Projection Rectification Network (CSPR-Net), a self-supervised deep learning framework for automated distortion correction. Our approach employs dual coordinate-based neural networks to learn the bi-directional mapping between the projector and camera spaces. By enforcing a robust cycle-consistency constraint, CSPR-Net autonomously resolves complex geometric transformations without requiring ground-truth deformation fields. Furthermore, a gradient-based loss function is introduced to mitigate the impact of complex ambient light interference and accurately capture high-frequency geometric variations. Quantitative evaluations in physical experimental scenarios demonstrate that CSPR-Net achieves a 20.7% improvement in end-to-end fidelity (SSIM) and outperforms the polynomial baseline by 3.8% and 5.4% in forward and inverse mapping in terms of SSIM respectively, effectively generating high-precision pre-warped images for seamless projection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Curved Surface Projection Projection Network (CSPR-Net) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u8868\u9762\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0 projector \u548c camera \u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u73af\u72b6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700 ground-truth \u53d8\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u5149\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9891\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5728\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cCSPR-Net \u5728\u603b\u4f53\u7cbe\u5ea6 (SSIM) \u4e0a\u8f83\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 20.7%\uff0c\u5728\u524d\u5411\u548c\u9006\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u7684 SSIM \u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 3.8% \u548c 5.4%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u53d8\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u3001\u5efa\u7b51\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u8868\u9762\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982 manual \u6821\u51c6\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u5149\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "CSPR-Net \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60 projector \u548c camera \u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u65b9\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u73af\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u73af\u5883\u5149\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCSPR-Net \u5728\u603b\u4f53SSIM\uff08\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff09\u4e0a\u8f83\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 20.7%\uff0c\u5728\u524d\u5411\u548c\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u7684 SSIM \u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 3.8% \u548c 5.4%\u3002\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9884\u53d8\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6821\u6b63 framework\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u660e\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u6295\u5f71\u6821\u51c6\u53ca\u5176\u9884\u53d8\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

This investigation is motivated by the fact that Mercury's post-Newtonian gravitational field (as well as that of any other planet) admits an expansion in terms of multipole moments, which are most appropriately defined in the local reference system. The equations of motion in the Mercury-centric local frame include relativistic local perturbations, given by the Schwarzschild term, Lense-Thirring precession, and the acceleration due to the quadrupole moment, and relativistic third-body perturbations, which are the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic accelerations, along with a coupling term between Mercury and other solar system bodies. The relativistic third-body perturbations are usually neglected in all practical applications. In this study, we analyze the magnitude of the post-Newtonian terms of the equations of motion formulated in the Mercury-centric frame, evaluating them along the trajectories of the two BepiColombo spacecrafts. Based on this analysis, we provide a practical approach for constructing a high-accuracy relativistic orbital model suitable for a Mercury orbiter.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We derive analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum of stable equatorial circular orbits, along with the corresponding radial and latitudinal oscillation frequencies, as functions of $M$, $a$, and $B$. We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Kerr-Bertotti-?obinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u6d4b\u9a8c\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u78c1\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d64\u9053\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u3001\u5f84\u5411\u548c\u7eac\u5411\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d4b\u9a8c\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u9644\u8fd1\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5149\u884c\u5dee\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u8fd1\u5fc3\u70b9\u504f\u79fb\u548cLense-Thirring\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u4e0e\u7eafKerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d7\u5230\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528WKB\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6cKerr-Bertotti-?obinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u963b\u5c3c\uff0c\u800c\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4e3b\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u3002\u4ece\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5feb\u65cb\u8f6cKerr-Bertotti-?obinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u51fa\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u9891\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u4e3a\u55b7\u5c04\u9525\u6216\u8fd1\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Kerr-Bertotti-?obinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6d4b\u9a8c\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728X\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u7b49\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Kerr-Bertotti-?obinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6d4b\u9a8c\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u78c1\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u548c\u5149\u884c\u5dee\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u4f7f\u7528WKB\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u9a8c\u7c92\u5b50\u5728Kerr-Bertotti-?obinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5916\u56f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u963b\u5c3c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u3002\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u55b7\u5c04\u9525\u548c\u8fd1\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u7531\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u9891\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u3002", "conclusion": "Kerr-Bertotti-?obinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u53d7\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5176\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u73b0\u8c61\u4e3a\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u591a\u9891\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Existing certification schemes often rely on fully trusted internal devices, which is difficult to achieve in realistic scenarios. Here, we propose a semi-device-independent framework for certifying channel properties directly from observed statistics, assuming only that the system dimension is known. By explicitly incorporating the full set of structural constraints inherent to Choi states, our approach exploits the Choi-Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism for rigorous certification of quantum channels. The entanglement dimensionality of quantum channels is first certified by introducing a witness and numerically determining its Schmidt-number-dependent bounds. This certification method reproduces known analytical benchmarks and is applied to dephasing and depolarizing noise channels, thereby confirming its validity. To provide a more complete assessment of channel performance, the entanglement fidelity of quantum channels is also certified using a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations based on localizing matrices. Lower bounds on the entanglement fidelity are obtained that are compatible with either the full set of observed statistics or a single witness value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u534a\u8bbe\u5907\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9ad8\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5df2\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u9700\u5df2\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u4e86Choi-Jamio\u0142kowski\u540c\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Choi\u6001\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u534a\u8bbe\u5907\u65e0\u5173\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u9a8c witnesses\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eSchmidt\u6570\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ef4\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u677e\u5f1b\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53bb\u6781\u5316\u548c\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u677e\u5f1b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e2\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e2awitness\u503c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u90e8\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Here, the effect of beam stirring between weakly coupled cores is observed for sub-nanosecond transform-limited pulses of several kW peak power propagating in ~10 m long 7-core fiber, for the first time to our knowledge. In contrast to low-power domain where the output power distribution in the cores is random with large fluctuations sensitive to fiber disturbances, at high power of the input pulse injected in the central core the output power becomes equalized between the cores with fluctuations reduced to <5% being insensitive to disturbances. Similar behavior is observed in cut-back experiments showing that equi-partition is approached at a distance of ~5 m. The performed modeling describes well the experimental results and clarifies mechanisms of the new effect reasoned by a large nonlinear phase shift changing along the pulse and thereby resulting in statistical averaging over the pulse length of multidirectional power transfer processes between cores, thus leading to the robust equilibrium (equi-partitition for hexagonal MCF topology). At the same time, the combined output beam measured in a far field takes a stable bell-shaped profile instead of speckled beam at low powers, similar to the beam self-cleaning effect in multimode fibers.", "AI": {"tldr": "observed beam stirring equalization in multicore fibers at high power, achieved through understanding the role of nonlinear phase shifts in achieving equi-partition among cores.", "motivation": "exploring nonlinear phenomena in multicore fibers for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and imaging.", "method": "used sub-nanosecond transform-limited pulses in a 7-core fiber and performed theoretical modeling to explain observed phenomena.", "result": "equalized output power between cores with reduced fluctuations at high input power, achieved in ~5m for cut-back experiments, and observed bell-shaped far-field profile.", "conclusion": "beam stirring effects are amenable to control with high power enabling stable beam distributions in multicore fibers, opening up possibilities for applications."}}

The structure of the solution allows one to identify new resummed factors that completely absorb all test-mass logarithms and transcendental numbers via exponentials and $\u0393$-functions at any post-Newtonian (PN) order. The corresponding residual relativistic and phase corrections are thus polynomial with rational coefficients, that are in fact PN-truncated hypergeometric functions. Our approach complements the recent proposal of Ivanov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135 (2025) 14, 141401], notably recovering the corresponding renormalization group scaling of multipole moments from first principles and fixing the scaling constant. In the test mass limit, our approach (pushed up to 10PN) yields waveforms and fluxes that are globally more accurate than those obtained using the standard factorized approach of Damour et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79 (2009), 064004]. The method generalizes straightforwardly to comparable mass binaries implementing the new concept of universal anomalous dimension of multipole moments and might be eventually useful to improve current state of the art effective-one-body waveform models for coalescing binaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we introduce and classify minimal nonintegrable spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians, defined as models that saturate injectivity while admitting no nontrivial local conserved charges beyond the Hamiltonian. We first rigorously establish the nonintegrability of the deformed Fredkin spin chain with periodic boundary conditions by mapping it to a nearest-neighbor composite-spin representation and excluding all admissible $3$-local conserved charges. Guided by its structure, we then construct five classes of spin-$1/2$ models with genuine three-site interactions.

Here we show that coupling molecular chirality to the topological structure of twisted light generates a protected phase observable that survives strong scattering. When Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum propagate through chiral media, spin-orbit interaction converts circular birefringence into an azimuthal rotation of the helical wavefront. Remarkably, this chiral phase memory persists at scattering strengths that fully depolarize conventional beams, with the rotation magnitude preserved quantitatively between transparent solutions and strongly scattering tissue. The sign of the azimuthal rotation encodes molecular handedness: opposite enantiomers produce mirror-symmetric phase maps even after multiple scattering. Differential measurements between conjugate topological charges isolate the chiral contribution while cancelling achiral background, enabling the resolution of refractive-index changes of order 10-6.

The model naturally resolves the initial singularity resulting in an infinite number of smooth non-singular bounces, while accommodating a phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field rolling at a constant rate. The presence of a timelike extra dimension induces high-energy corrections to the effective Friedmann dynamics, allowing anisotropic shear to be dynamically suppressed near the bounce and rendering the background evolution stable. We derive the full background dynamics analytically and demonstrate that uniform-rate inflation can be consistently embedded within an anisotropic braneworld framework. Primordial scalar and tensor perturbations are analysed using the $\u03b4N$ formalism, ensuring that only physically relevant modes exiting the horizon during inflation contribute to observable quantities. Remarkably, we find that observational consistency can be achieved with different levels of anisotropy in the two different scenarios we consider, without compromising the smoothness or stability of the bounce.

Extending this framework to general, time-dependent states governed by the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) formula has remained an open problem, as the relevant extremal surfaces do not lie on a common spatial slice. We resolve this by constructing a graph model directly from the causal structure of entanglement wedges.

To certify the performance of such tasks, one can make a random decision in each trial, either spot-checking some desired property or utilizing the quantum resource for the given task. However, a general method for certification with a sequence of non-i.i.d. spot-checking trials is still missing. Here, we develop such a method. This method not only works efficiently with a finite number of trials but also yields asymptotically tight certificates of performance.

When operated in the strong dispersive regime, this interaction enables parity measurements of the mode which, in combination with phase-space displacements, constitute a standard experimental tool for full Wigner-function tomography.

The method employs a sequency-ordered Quantum Walsh-Hadamard Transform (QWHT), a comparator-based oracle that coherently marks basis states within an arbitrary sequency range, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to estimate the total probability mass in the selected band. This enables the detection of structured signal components, including both high- and low-sequency features, as well as the identification of rapid sign-change behavior associated with noise or anomalies. The proposed method can be embedded as a module within a larger quantum algorithm; in this setting, both the input and output remain fully quantum, enabling seamless integration with upstream and downstream quantum operations. We show that the sequency-ordered QWHT can be implemented with circuit depth $O(\\log_2 N)$ (equivalently $O(n)$ for $N=2^n$) when acting on an amplitude-encoded quantum state, whereas computing the full Walsh-Hadamard spectrum of an explicit length-$N$ classical signal requires $O(N\\log_2 N)$ operations via the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform. This results in an exponential quantum advantage when the QWHT is used as a modular block within a larger quantum algorithm, relative to classical fast Walsh-Hadamard transform-based approaches operating on explicit data. From an application perspective, the proposed sequency band-energy estimation may be interpreted as a structure-based anomaly indicator, enabling the detection of unexpected high-sequency components relative to a nominal low-sequency signal class. The algorithm is applicable to quantum-enhanced signal processing tasks such as zero-crossing analysis, band-limited noise estimation, and feature extraction in the Walsh basis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u6307\u5b9a\u9891\u6b21\u5e26\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6210\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50 Walsh-Hadamard \u53d8\u6362 (QWHT)\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668oracle \u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u632f\u5e45\u4f30\u8ba1 (QAE)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9891\u6b21\u5e26\u80fd\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9891\u6b21\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176 Quantum \u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u7a7f\u8d8a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5e26\u9650\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) offers a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the probabilistic nature of non-local entangling gates. Qudit circuit compression schemes mitigate this issue by encoding multiple qubits onto qudits. However, these schemes become inefficient when only a subset of the encoded qubits is required to participate in the non-local entangling gate, leading to an exponential increase in the number of non-local gates. In this Letter, we address this bottleneck by demonstrating the existence of multi-level control-Z (CZ) gates for qudits encoded in multiple spatial modes in LOQC. Unlike conventional two-level CZ gates, which act only on a single pair of modes, multi-level CZ gates impart a conditional phase shift for an arbitrarily chosen subset of the spatial modes. We present two explicit linear optical schemes that realize such operations, illustrating a fundamental trade-off between prior information about the input quantum state and the physical resources required. The first scheme is realized with a constant success probability of $1/8$ independent of the qudit dimension using a single non-local entangling gate, at the cost of state dependence, which is significantly better than the current success probability of $1/9$. Our second scheme provides a fully state independent realization reducing the number of non-local gates to $\\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1}+2^{r_2})$ as compared to the existing bound of $\\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1+r_2})$ where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the number of qubits to be removed as control in the qudits. The success probability of the realization is $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{2^{r_1}+2^{r_2}}$. When combined with qudit circuit compression schemes, our results improve upon a key scalability limitation and significantly improve the efficiency of LOQC architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOQC\u9762\u4e34\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7ea0\u7f20\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236-Z\uff08CZ\uff09\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u6240\u9700\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7ea7 CZ \u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LOQC\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u83b7\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236-Z\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236-Z\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u56fa\u5b9a\u76841/8\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\u5219\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u8fbe\u52301/2*(1/8)^(2^{r1}+2^{r2})\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236-Z\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236-Z\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Recent work has investigated the quantum complexity of particular multiplicities, such as the Kronecker coefficients and certain special cases of the plethysm coefficients.\n  Here, we show that a broad class of representation-theoretic multiplicities is in #BQP.

We obtain our result by multiple applications of the Schur transform. Recent work has improved its dependence on the local dimension, which is crucial for our work. We further describe a general approach for showing that representation-theoretic multiplicities are in #BQP that captures our approach as well as the approaches of prior work.

Recent experimental advances have enabled the tailoring of noise properties through Pauli twirling, transforming arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels. This underpins theoretical descriptions of fault-tolerant quantum computation and forms an essential tool in noise characterization and error mitigation. Pauli-Lindblad channels have been introduced to aptly parameterize quasi-local Pauli errors across a quantum register, excluding negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters relying on the Markovianity of the underlying noise processes. We point out that caution is required when parameterizing channels as Pauli-Lindblad channels with nonnegative parameters. For this, we study the effects of Pauli twirling on Markovianity. We use the notion of Markovianity of a channel (rather than that of an entire semigroup) and prove a general Pauli channel is non-Markovian if and only if at least one of its Pauli-Lindblad parameters is negative. Using this, we show that Markovian quantum channels often become non-Markovian after Pauli twirling. The Pauli-twirling induced non-Markovianity necessitates the use of negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters for a correct noise description in experimentally realistic scenarios. An important example is the implementation of the $\\sqrt{X}$-gate under standard Markovian noise. As such, our results have direct implications for quantum error mitigation protocols that rely on accurate noise characterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The main proposition of PI is to minimise variationally a loss function, formally ensuring that a neural surrogate of the solution has the DE locally satisfied. The nature of such formulation encouraged the exploration of equivalent quantum algorithms, where the surrogate solution is expressed by variational quantum architectures. The locality of typical loss functions emphasises the DE to hold at an ensemble of points sampled in the domain, but encounters issues when generalising beyond such points, or when propagating boundary conditions. Issues which affect classical and quantum PI algorithms alike. The quest to fill this gap in robustness and accuracy against mainstream DE solvers has led to a plethora of proposals in various directions. In particular, classical DE solvers have long employed the weak form - an integral based approach aiming at imposing a global condition on the solution - prioritising a good average behaviour instead of ``overfitting'' select points. Here, we propose and explore to combine contributions from both local and global loss functions in PI routines, to exploit the advantages and mitigate the weaknesses of both. We showcase this intuition in a variety of problems focusing on differentiable quantum architectures, and demonstrating in particular how orchestrating such hybrid loss formulation with domain decomposition can offer a strong advantage over local-only strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This work reports the robustness of encoding photons in different basis before it is sent towards the object and recovery of polarization entanglement even after a kilometer-scale scattering from the objects, establishing a practical foundation for scalable quantum-assisted object detection and ranging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u632f\u5316\u5149\u5bf9\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8ddd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5982\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6ce2\u591a\u5c14\u65af\u57fa-\u7f57\u68ee(EPR)\u8fdd\u53cd\u6027\uff0c\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u8fd9\u79cd\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8428\u5c14\u76d6\u7eb3\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u7684\u4e24\u5149\u5b50\u504f\u632f\u5316\u7ea0\u7f20\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97CHSH\u53c2\u6570S=2.802\u00b10.002\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ea0\u7f20\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u504f\u632f\u5149\u7528\u4f5c\u5907\u9009\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5149\u88ab\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u53c2\u8003\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u63a2\u9488\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u3002\u63a2\u9488\u8def\u5f84\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u7ecf\u8fc7\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6d4b\u8ddd\u7ea61\u516c\u91cc\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46CHSH\u503cS>2.6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f20\u64ad\u540e\u7684\u5149\u5076Still\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ea0\u7f20\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6d4b\u8ddd\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Still, large-scale simulations of quantum circuits are essential for determining the problem size at which quantum solutions outperform classical methods. In this work, we present a novel hybrid simulation approach, forming a hybrid of a fullstate and a Clifford simulator, specifically designed to address the computational challenges associated with the time evolution of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our method focuses on the efficient emulation of multi-qubit rotations, a critical component of Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution. By optimizing the representation and execution of multi-qubit operations leveraging the Pauli frame, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of simulating quantum circuits, enabling more efficient simulations. Beyond its impact on chemistry applications, our emulation strategy has broad implications for any computational workload that relies heavily on multi-qubit rotations. By increasing the efficiency of quantum simulations, our method facilitates more accurate and cost-effective studies of complex quantum systems. We quantify the performance improvements and computational savings for this emulation strategy, and we obtain a speedup of a factor $\\approx 18$ ($\\approx 22$ with MPI) for our evaluated chemistry Hamiltonians with 24 qubits. Thus, we evaluate our integration of this emulation strategy into the Intel Quantum SDK, further bridging the gap between theoretical algorithm development and practical quantum software implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
