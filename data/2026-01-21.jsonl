This gravitational framework accounts for a massive graviton while ensuring the absence of ghost instabilities during propagation. The BEC stellar configuration in this study was obtained by determining the solutions characterized by static and spherical symmetric metric. This study provides a detailed account of the stellar structure, highlighting the roles played by massive gravity and the Kuchowicz metric through a combination of analytical and numerical solutions. Our work specifically utilizes the Colpi-Wasserman-shapiro (CWS) and Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations of state (EoS) to model the internal thermodynamic behavior of the BEC. We have evaluated the physical viability of the BEC stellar framework by analyzing the energy conditions, and the EoS parameter along with the gradients of the energy-momentum tensor. The stability criteria such as the study of surface redshift, adiabatic index and squared sound velocity were utilized to confirm that our proposed model is both stable and physically consistent. Hence, this study offers a definitive structural analysis of the BEC stars, providing precise results in this massive gravity environment."}

Working in a post-Minkowskian approximation, we show for the first time that the prompt response is given by the residue of poles at $ω=0$ present in the complex Fourier domain. The contribution of the high-frequency arcs, previously assumed to generate the prompt response, vanishes. The analytical expression of the prompt response in this scheme is a polynomial of order $\\ell$ in the observer's retarded time, with $\\ell$ the multipole number. We validate the model against numerical predictions, obtaining good agreement for a compact source far from the black hole. We provide a phenomenologically-corrected expression to improve the match as the source is moved closer. We investigate the polynomial structure of the prompt response for sources close to the black hole through a series of numerical fits. Our work is a fundamental step in the broader effort to develop first-principles, analytical models for binary black hole coalescence signals, valid close to the merger and during the early ringdown stage."}

We further present a near-extremal estimate that tightens the stability bound for rapidly spinning black holes. These refinements sharpen the analytic stability limits without introducing extra assumptions."}

In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields."}

PANIP is trained using an automated multi-fidelity active learning (MFAL) workflow, in which a representative training subset, termed PDB-FRAGID (PDB Fragment Interaction Dataset), was distilled from an otherwise prohibitively large pool of fragment dimers extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PANIP retains ωB97X-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP-level accuracy and achieves mean absolute errors below 0.2 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution systems, demonstrating excellent transferability across diverse NCI motifs. Compared to the widely used ANI-2x potential, PANIP delivers substantially lower errors, particularly for charged and strongly interacting dimers. Coupled with a fragmentation-based energy decomposition scheme, PANIP estimates protein-ligand binding energies at near force-field computational cost yet QM-level accuracy, enabling its use as a fragment-based scoring function that rivals specialized docking scoring functions."}

Here we show that the purity of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes can be protected against degradation in random media by leveraging two fundamental features of their own Schrödinger Hamiltonian dynamics, namely, Zeno effect -- frequent observations slow down the evolution -- , and Gouy phase -- the back-action of the observation. Repeated, OAM-dependent Gouy phase kicks imparted along the disturbing path by simple imaging systems trigger the optical Zeno effect that protects the input OAM mode against mode cross-talk that would broaden the OAM spectrum. Given the universality of the mechanism, the Gouy phase-assisted Zeno effect would protect propagation modes other than those of OAM, and the diverse forms of structured light built with them."}

While critical information about a material's charge dynamics is encoded in its plasmons, collective modes of the electron gas, these excitations have not yet been observed in nickelate materials. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates."}

As a fundamental step, we derive analytical Green's functions for the displacement and stress fields generated by a point load traveling at a constant velocity along the surface, explicitly incorporating elastodynamic effects through Mach number dependence. These moving-load solutions serve as building blocks for constructing more general loading scenarios via linear superposition. Based on Green's functions, an inverse problem is formulated to reconstruct the unknown surface traction responsible for a given surface displacement. The inverse analysis is performed through a Fourier-domain inversion with regularization, which enables a direct and computationally efficient determination of the contact pressure without iterative forward simulations. This framework is applied to a rigid wheel-ground contact problem, where the imposed displacement is dictated by the wheel geometry. The reconstructed surface traction exhibits a smooth, symmetric distribution within the contact region, while the resulting subsurface stress fields are obtained in closed analytical form and involve dilogarithm functions. The principal stress difference reveals characteristic spatial patterns similar to photoelastic fringes, and their asymmetry increases with the Mach number, reflecting the dynamic nature of the moving contact."}

To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments."}

Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials."}

This modification causes the parameter to vary according to the system's history throughout the simulation. Previous works usually modify the Rulkov model by introducing additional parameters altering its behavior. Here, by contrast, we retain the original equations and allow the control parameters to vary in time, thereby preserving the model's fundamental properties. In this sense, the proposed model is locally equivalent in time to the original one. However, unlike the original model, which reproduces a single neuronal regime per simulation, the new memristive version exhibits both uniform and chaotic transitions among multiple neuronal activity regimes. Its dynamics are examined with respect to the rate at which the memristive function changes and the number of internal states it stores. Three distinct scenarios emerge around a bifurcation point. Before the bifurcation, the system undergoes uniform transitions toward a stable bursting regime. After the bifurcation, it shows uniform transitions toward a final spiking or silent regime. At the bifurcation point, highly complex transitions arise. As examples, we present trajectories in which the neuron chaotically switches between regimes without ever settling, and trajectories for which it requires around 140000 map iterations to reach a stationary regime."}

We consider surfaces defined by small spherical harmonic perturbations of a round sphere and evolve them under an in-slice, time-flat flow analogous to inverse mean curvature flow. We examine the behaviour of the Hawking mass under the flow and find that monotonicity persists for a class of nonspherical perturbations and is robust under variations in perturbation amplitude and angular frequency. We also identify regimes in which numerical instabilities arise, highlighting practical challenges associated with extending such flows beyond simple symmetry assumptions. These results provide a concrete computational testbed for future investigations of uniformly expanding flows and quasi-local mass in more general spacetime settings."}

In this work, we demonstrate a Spintronic Poisson (SP) bolometer enabling room-temperature ultra-broadband sensing across 3-14 um. Unlike conventional bolometers that rely on continuous analog signals, the SP bolometer implements a Poisson-counting detection paradigm, encoding temperature in discrete stochastic events, which turns thermal noise from a limitation into the basis of the estimator itself. We fabricate the SP bolometer using a spintronic transduction layer integrated with a plasmonic nanoantenna array to enhance broadband infrared absorption. Using spintronic transduction, the device achieves the noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD, thermal sensitivity metric) of 80-100 mK at 300 K, surpassing uncooled detectors and approaching cooled technologies. This work establishes a statistical detection paradigm for room-temperature infrared sensing with broad application potential."}

But these, just as the Bloch phase correlations, disappear at lengths larger than the diffusion length. If a quasi-two dimensional metal with Berry curvature has a set of domains, their boundaries necessarily carry chiral currents precluding back-ward scattering. The Berry induced phase coherence then persists over length scales of order the scale at which the chiral one-dimensional states scatter into the bulk states, which can be macroscopic. The conditions for their occurrence and the lengths and the orientation of such states are derived. These calculations are used to understand the remarkable aspects of a recent experiment in an anisotropic metal, reported to have loop-current order, with mean-free path of about 0.01 $μ$m which exhibits flux quantization in some transport properties over lengths of several $μ$m. %It is also shown that generating the appropriately oriented channels in the plane by the field applied is plausible."}

The objective is to optimize the combined requirements of high radiation length and stiffness properties of the designed materials. The present study targets conventional beampipe materials such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel as primary performance benchmarks. These conventional beampipes are used at synchrotron radiation sources, such as Indus-1 and Indus-2 in India, the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility in Russia, and the ring synchrotron facility SIS 100/300 at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. In this context, a series of ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys is systematically investigated to enhance the figure of merit. Two aluminum--rich alloys, A1 ($\\mathrm{Al_{61.5}Li_{10.8}Mg_{27.7}}$) and A2 ($\\mathrm{Al_{66}Li_{19.4}Mg_{14.6}}$), along with three magnesium-rich alloys, M1 ($\\mathrm{Al_{23.9}Li_{29.3}Mg_{46.8}}$), M2 ($\\mathrm{Al_{19}Li_{20.6}Mg_{60.4}}$), and M3 ($\\mathrm{Al_{39.8}Li_{20.1}Mg_{40.1}}$) are explored. Thermodynamic stability, density, liquidus temperature, and phases are evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling within the Thermo-Calc TC-Python framework. Elastic properties are obtained from density functional theory calculations performed using the Vienna \\textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package. Our results show that, although the elastic moduli ($E$) of the investigated Mg-Al-Li alloys are comparable to those of conventional beampipe materials, their significantly higher radiation lengths ($X_0$) lead to an overall improvement in the figure of merit $X_0 E^{1/3}$."}

Laughlin proposed an elegant explanation in which adiabatic insertion of a flux tube pumps charge through the system. This analysis unveils the fundamental role of gauge invariance and provides a compelling argument about the fractional charge of fractional quantum Hall states. While it has been used extensively as a theoretical tool, a quantitative experimental investigation is lacking despite multiple attempts. Here we report successful realizations of Laughlin pumping in several integer and fractional quantum Hall states. One essential technical innovation is using surface acoustic waves to periodically clear the charges accumulated during the pumping process. Magnetic fluxes are inserted at a constant rate so there is no need to perform complicated data fitting. Furthermore, our setting can reliably extract $σ_\\mathrm{xx}$ that is several orders of magnitude lower than the limit of conventional techniques.

Our results show that the short-time exponential decay rate follows a power-law dependence on the hole size, with different scaling exponents for holes placed in chaotic regions versus mixed phase space regions. For holes located in mixed phase space regions, the decay exponent of the long-time power-law tail remains approximately constant, while the amplitude follows a power-law scaling with hole size.

The physical origin of this torsion remains debated and is often attributed to helically arranged load-bearing elements, despite the lack of direct evidence for helicity in the native fiber. Here we show that torsion can arise generically from nonlinear anisotropic elasticity: humidity-driven shortening of the amorphous matrix, mechanically constrained by stiff, axially aligned $β$-sheet--rich load-bearing segments and their experimentally induced prestretch, drives the system into a dual Poynting regime in which axial shortening couples to spontaneous twist. Coupling a diffusion-based water-uptake law to irreversible matrix remodeling and fiber plasticity, the model quantitatively reproduces monotonic and cyclic torsional measurements using parameter values consistent with available experimental material parameters. These results identify supercontraction-induced torsion in spider silk as a manifestation of a dual Poynting effect and provide a minimal, physically grounded framework for humidity-driven torsional actuation in matrix--fiber architectures."}

Remarkably, we find that self-bound quantum droplets can exist in the strongly interacting regime, preempting the formation of boson-fermion dimers, when the Fermi pressure is balanced by the resonant boson-fermion attraction. This scenario can be achieved in experimentally available Bose-Fermi mixtures for a range of boson-fermion mass ratios in the vicinity of equal masses. We furthermore show that a larger fermion density instead yields phase separation between a Bose-Fermi mixture and excess fermions, as well as behavior reminiscent of a liquid-gas critical point.

Three dominant outcomes are identified: a minor three-body channel and two four-body channels (sequential and near-simultaneous dissociation of both molecules). The key result is that pathway selection is strongly correlated with the degree of ionization during the laser interaction, which is in turn strongly modulated by laser-molecule orientation. Higher early-time ionization predisposes the system toward near-simultaneous four-body breakup, whereas lower ionization favors sequential and three-body fragmentation; for low-ionization cases, a fragment-resolved charge metric further differentiates three-body and sequential behavior. These charge-dependent trends consistently map onto experimentally accessible observables: the simultaneous mechanism dominates the high-energy tail of the kinetic energy release (KER) spectrum and populate distinct regions of the emission-angle distributions, while sequential events concentrate at lower KER. Overall, early-time charge evolution provides a unifying explanation for channel branching and for the channel-resolved fragmentation signatures."}

Very recently, people realized that the microscopic geometry of the entanglement cut can induce distinct entanglement-edge modes, whose coupling to bulk critical fluctuations may alter the scaling of the EE. However, this perception is very qualitative and lacks quantitative consideration. Here, we investigate this problem through high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with the analysis of scaling theory to build a quantitative understanding. By considering three distinct bipartitions corresponding to three surface criticality types, we reveal a striking dependence of the constant term γ on the microscopic cut at the quantum critical point. Notably, cuts that generate extra gapless edge modes yield a sign reversal in γ compared to those producing gapped edges. We explain this behavior via a modified scaling form that incorporates contributions from both bulk and surface critical modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derivative of EE robustly extracts the bulk critical point and exponent ν regardless of the cut geometry, providing a reliable diagnostic of bulk universality in the presence of strong surface effects. Our work for the first time establishes a direct quantitative connection between surface criticality and entanglement scaling, challenging the conventional view that EE solely reflects bulk properties and offering a refined framework for interpreting entanglement in systems with boundary-sensitive criticality."}

Many-body interactions with the filled massive Dirac fermion $ν= 1$ level yield a strong renormalization of the emission spectrum, including fully polarized emission, a pronounced redshift, and broadening relative to neutral and charged excitons.

In this work, building on Gaudin's generalized kaleidoscope model, we present a detailed investigation of the relationship between DN symmetry and its integrability. We demonstrate that the mathematical essence of integrability in this class of models is characterized by a newly proposed Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation. Furthermore, we show that the solvability of a model via the coordinate Bethe ansatz depends not only on the consistency relations satisfied by scattering matrices, but also on the model's boundary conditions and the symmetry of the subspace where solutions are sought. Through finite element method based numerical studies, we further confirm that Bethe ansatz integrability arises in a specific symmetry sector. Finally, by analyzing the algebraic structure of the Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation, we derive a series of novel quantum algebraic identities within the framework of quantum torus algebra."}

For the case $ω< -3/2$, where energy conditions are violated and bouncing solutions exist classically, we demonstrate that quantum backreaction effects significantly smooth the bounce of directional scale factors, with the bounce occurring at scales set by the quantum state width. For the conformally invariant case $ω= -3/2$, quantum corrections cause scale factors to enter accelerated expansion phases more rapidly than in the classical limit. Most significantly, we show that cross-correlation terms between canonical variables are essential for obtaining physically consistent effective dynamics: neglecting these terms leads to spurious divergences and unphysical behavior. When correlations are included, small-amplitude oscillations appear shortly after the bounce, rapidly damping to classical trajectories. We interpret these oscillations as quantum remnant effects encoding information about correlations between gravitational and scalar field degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate that cross-correlations carry crucial quantum information that substantially influences cosmological dynamics, with implications for quantum gravity phenomenology near singularities.

Here, we investigate guided surface acoustic wave phononic four-wave mixing at gigahertz frequencies in an aluminum scandium nitride/4H-silicon carbide heterostructure operated at both room temperature (295 K) and cryogenic temperature (4 K). The 500 nm thick aluminum scandium nitride film supports guided Rayleigh and Sezawa modes with distinct displacement and strain energy density distributions, allowing a direct comparison of mode-dependent nonlinear behavior within the same device. Continuous-wave four-wave mixing measurements reveal an enhancement in the extracted modal nonlinear coefficient at 4 K relative to 295 K for both modes. In addition, the Rayleigh mode exhibits a modal nonlinearity approximately two orders of magnitude larger than that of the Sezawa mode across both temperature regimes. These results demonstrate that phononic four-wave mixing is strongly influenced by temperature, mode confinement, and strain localization while establishing aluminum scandium nitride on silicon carbide heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering enhanced nonlinear phononic interactions for future classical and quantum acoustic on-chip signal processing systems."}

These simulations are further refined via a TALYS-based adjustment of hadronic cross sections. For the BERT-based models, the adjustment reduces the discrepancy in the total neutron yield from about 20% to approximately 6%, while for the BIC-based models it improves the agreement from roughly 13% to the sub-percent level (~0.3%), indicating a markedly better consistency of the BIC-based models with the experimental data.

The system is driven by terahertz radiation, and the spatial asymmetry required for the generation of dc photocurrent is introduced by a phase shift between the radiation's near-field modulation and the static electron density profile. In contrast to the commonly used perturbative \"minimal model\" of the ratchet effect, which assumes weak density modulation, we solve the problem exactly with respect to the static gate-induced potential while treating the radiation field perturbatively. This approach reveals a dramatic enhancement of the plasmonic contribution to the ratchet current due to the interference of \"bright\" and \"dark\" plasmon modes, which are excited on an equal footing in the asymmetric LPC. Specifically, we predict a parametric growth of the plasmonic peak as compared with the Drude peak with increasing coupling, and the appearance of a dense super-resonant structure when the spacing between plasmonic sub-bands becomes larger than the damping rate. Hence, the dc response exhibits both resonant and super-resonant regimes observed in recent experiments on the radiation transmission through the LPC. The interplay of bright and dark modes, together with their interference, provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the magnitude and sign of the photocurrent by gate voltages and the radiation frequency."}

While high-purity electronic-grade diamond exhibits third-order nonlinear absorption, NV-doped samples display pronounced saturable absorption that strengthens with increasing defect concentration. Linear transmission spectroscopy reveals that, in addition to NV centers, the crystals host significant populations of H2 (NVN-) defect complexes whose absorption band partially overlaps the excitation wavelength. By correlating spectroscopic data with nonlinear measurements and modeling the response using an effective two-level system, we show that the observed saturation cannot be attributed solely to NV centers but arises from the combined contribution of NV-related and H2 defects. For the highly doped sample, we determine an effective linear absorption coefficient of alpha0 = 6.52 cm-1 and a saturation intensity of Is = 40.0 GW/cm2.

Under ideal conditions, uniform eigenpainting generates a linear-force equilibrium distribution in the transverse plane, with zero volume in four-dimensional transverse phase space, even including space charge. We have implemented eigenpainting for the first time in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Accumulator Ring.

By exploiting the hotspot formation in the vicinity of plasmonic structures, SERS constitutes an established tool for fundamental biological research, particularly for early-stage disease diagnostics. In this context, the DNA Origami technique, with its high addressability, enables both the assembly of plasmonic nanostructures with nanometric accuracy, and the deterministic placement of a single analyte molecule precisely at the generated hotspot within them. To date, most DNA Origami based nanoantennas rely on gold or silver nanoparticles (NPs), whose plasmonic resonances are confined to the visible spectrum, severely limiting their use in other spectral ranges. To extend the operating range, we have recently established a robust strategy for self-assembling programmable ultraviolet (UV)-plasmonic dimer antennas using rhodium nanocubes. Herein, we leverage this tailored architecture to systematically investigate its performance for single-molecule UV-SERS. We demonstrated how biofabricated Rh-dimers can be used to detect the characteristic SERS signal of a single streptavidin molecule linked at the dimer s gap. Our results are validated through polarization dependent measurements that yield the expected signal modulation depending on the the dimer orientation only for the DNA origami with a protein at the hotspot.

In this paper we prove that any Hamiltonian hosting such ``ferromagnetic scar states'' necessarily admits a structural decomposition into a Zeeman term and an ``annihilator'' that annihilates the entire scar manifold. Moreover, we show that this annihilator must itself decompose into a sum of terms built from local projectors that locally annihilate the scar states. This architecture is closely related to the Shiraishi--Mori construction, and our main theorem establishes that an appropriate generalization of that construction is in fact essentially exhaustive for this class of scar states."}

The CO$_2$ + H$_2$ product forms through two different pathways that bifurcate after formation of the OCH$_2$O intermediate.

The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model and with the experimental consequences.

To improve the efficiency of a packed-bed SHS system through second law analysis (SLA), we developed macroscopic entropy and exergy transport equations for fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media based on microscopic transport equations. These equations enable us to identify where and how much exergy is destroyed. Using a packed-bed SHS system developed at the PROMES-CNRS laboratory as a test case, we demonstrated how to apply SLA to optimize an SHS system. Our analysis revealed that, in addition to exit and heat leakage losses at tank surfaces, thermal and solid conduction losses inside the tank significantly contribute to total loss in the studied SHS system. These internal losses occur close to the thermocline. However, their slower transport causes a delay in their emergence. The SLA suggests an optimal tank aspect ratio of D/H = 0.75, at which the total exergy loss coefficient reaches its minimum value when exit loss is not considered. As particle size decreases, the exergy loss coefficient also decreases due to enhanced heat transfer between the fluid and solid phases. The pressure loss for the studied SHS system is negligible. The SLA favors a truncated cone-shaped tank with a slightly larger upper surface. Through the SLA, the exergy loss coefficient is reduced from 4.9% for the original design to 4.1% for the optimized design. This study demonstrates that, when used in conjunction with energy analysis, the SLA is an effective tool for optimizing energy storage systems."}

Due to the inversion symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the spinor structure of the wave function, spin-wave eigenstates form doublets with definite parity. Micromagnetic simulation tallies well with numerical calculation. Our study on spin-wave eigenstates in CrSBr waveguides sheds light on the nature of exchange-dipole spin wave in ferromagnetic slabs. We confirm particularly that the robustness of the Damon-Eshbach mode is not derived from topology, but rather from the static dipolar field.

In this theoretical work, we explore how tunneling dynamics in a bosonic Josephson junction are modified when the system is placed in a rotating, non-inertial frame. We show that the tunneling dynamics of ultracold bosons in a two-dimensional double-well potential offer an alternative pathway for inferring the rotation frequency. Using the mean-field and many-body analyses, we demonstrate that rotation strongly modifies the tunneling time period as well as the momentum and angular momentum dynamics. When the rotation axis passes through the center of the double well, the observables show distinct dynamical responses with increasing rotation frequency, enabling the rotation frequency to be assessed from changes in the tunneling dynamics. When the potential is displaced from the rotation axis, the rotation induces asymmetric tunneling and partial self-trapping, allowing both the rotation frequency and the displacement to be inferred. We further show that for an off-centered double well, the tunneling dynamics exhibit a pronounced orientation dependence, enabling the orientation of the double well to be inferred from the observed dynamics. The many-body analysis further shows that the depletion dynamics are strongly influenced by rotation, providing an additional tool for assessing the rotation frequency. Finally, we study the effect of time-dependent rotation in which the double well is gradually set into motion in the laboratory frame and identify distinct dynamical signatures that depend sensitively on the switching time. Together, these results establish a comprehensive framework for inferring the rotation frequency, radial displacement, and orientation directly from the tunneling dynamics."}

The resulting quasiparticle energies from $G_0W_0$ closely reproduce reference ionization potentials, while BSE calculations based on the same tuned RSH orbitals yield quantitatively accurate optical absorption spectra and excitonic properties across a range of molecular systems and clusters."}

Leveraging these ideas, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) scheme that expresses the mean-field energy as a functional of the single-particle density matrix, providing an alternative to gradient-based optimization of Thouless parameters. We derive the analytic orbital Hessian to diagnose HF stability and compute ground-state correlation energy through the random-phase approximation (RPA).

Radar suits this role by sensing motion through occlusions and in darkness. Modern deep-learning pipelines are the standard for interpreting radar returns effectively; however, they are often parameter-heavy and sensitive at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), motivating compact alternatives like Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs). A two-qubit HQNN is benchmarked against convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar measurements under matched training protocols. In clean conditions, the HQNN achieves high accuracy (99.7% synthetic; 97.0% real) with up to 170x fewer parameters (0.066M). Its parameter efficiency is shown to be structural, as an ablation of the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) causes sharp performance drops on real data (to 68.5% and 31.5% for the control heads). A domain-dependent sensitivity emerges under additive-noise evaluation, where the HQNN begins recovery earlier in synthetic data while CNNs recover more steeply and peak higher on real measurements. In label-fraction ablations, CNNs prove more sample-efficient on real Range-Doppler Maps (RDMs), with the performance gap being most pronounced (at 50% labels, BA 0.89-0.99 vs. HQNN 0.75). On synthetic data, this gap narrows significantly, largely vanishing by the 50% label mark. Overall, the HQNN's value lies in parameter efficiency and a compact inductive bias that shapes its distinct sensitivity profile; this work establishes a rigorous baseline for hybrid quantum models in privacy-preserving radar occupancy sensing."}

We report bright heralded single-photon superradiance via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1-mm-long, high-density cesium vapor cell. By reducing the average distance between atoms in the atomic vapor to 0.29 times the idler photon wavelength, we observe a dramatic narrowing of the temporal two-photon wavefunction. This compression of temporal two-photon wavefunction evidences the superradiance of heralded photons in the collective two-photon emission dynamics. Furthermore, our heralded single-photon superradiance is accompanied by a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 200 and the detected photon-pair counting exceeding 10^6 pairs/s.

Hosts are encoded as electrostatic surfaces and guests as molecular graphs, enabling transferable learning across diverse supramolecular systems. DeepHostGuest achieves high-accuracy predictions (RMSD $\\leq 2$ Angstrom for 80.8% of test cases), substantially outperforming classical docking without case-specific tuning.

Density Functional Theory (DFT)-calculated affinities correlate well with experiment, enabling structure-property relationships across 876 host-guest complexes spanning 34 host families. Interpretable feature analysis reveals that binding strength arises from a cooperative interplay of host polarity, guest hydrophobicity, and geometric complementarity, with distinct design regimes across supramolecular classes. Together, these results establish data-driven molecular recognition as a practical route to predictive supramolecular design, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and rational optimization of functional host-guest systems."}

This coupling exhibits pronounced graph topological features, and we design a graph neural network (GNN) to accurately abstract its inherent physics.

We show that, within the aligned null pp--wave ansatz ($A_v=0$, no $v$--dependence, $F_{xy}=0$) and enforcing the source--free Maxwell equations to $\\mathcal O(γ)$, a generic profile $f(x,y)$ is incompatible with Maxwell: the transverse field $F_{ui}$ must be both divergence--free and curl--free on the transverse plane, hence $F_{ui}=\\partial_iΦ$ with $Δ_\\perpΦ=0$.\n  We give a minimal, polarization--agnostic gauge completion of the modulated potential and prove a cancellation theorem: under standard decay/regularity (or zero--mode) conditions that exclude additional harmonic transverse modes, all $\\mathcal O(γ)$ dependence on $f$ drops out of $F_{ui}$ and therefore out of the electrovac source $T_{uu}$. Consequently, the electromagnetic contribution to the Brinkmann profile is universal at $\\mathcal O(γ)$: the familiar cycle--averaged isotropic $r^2$ term plus an isotropic oscillatory correction at frequency $2ω$, present only for non-circular polarisation. We isolate the residual Maxwell--admissible freedom as harmonic (holomorphic) transverse data and, by Kerr--Schild linearity, superpose an arbitrary co--propagating vacuum gravitational pp--wave, relating TT--gauge strain to Brinkmann amplitudes. Modelling genuinely localised beams, therefore, requires currents, non-null components, or more general Kundt/gyraton geometries."}

The linear perturbation analysis is performed in the background Æther-orthogonal frame, in which the axes of the gravitational wave sound cones remain perpendicular to these hypersurfaces, thereby simplifying the analysis. The leading-order results show that Einstein-Æther theory admits two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode, consistent with the findings in the flat spacetime background. We further derive the dispersion relations and linear stability conditions for these modes in curved backgrounds. At next-to-leading order, we obtain the amplitude evolution equations, finding that the graviton number is conserved for the tensor modes but not for the vector and scalar modes. Next-to-leading-order effects also induce mixing among polarization modes. Our study demonstrates that, after imposing the GW170817 constraint on the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the vector modes mixed with the leading-order tensor modes cannot be used to distinguish between general relativity and Einstein-Æther theory. On the other hand, the mixing between scalar modes and the leading-order tensor modes leads to distinct predictions in the two theories, providing a promising avenue to test Einstein-Æther gravity through the detection of polarization mixing in gravitational waves."}

However, the temporal stability remains challenged by issues like line-width broadening and high-power demand in efforts to improve it. In this work, we investigate the effect of the second-harmonic generation process on the laser characteristics under three longitudinal mode regimes: single-longitudinal-mode, dual-longitudinal-mode, and multi-longitudinal-mode. The results demonstrate that the second-harmonic generation process effectively stabilizes the temporal characteristics of the laser and enhances its correlation, leading to a temporally clean output beam. The physical mechanism of the observed temporal stabilization effect can be attributed to a high-peak-pulse attenuation effect, jointly induced by nonuniform longitudinal-mode depletion and phase preservation in the residual fundamental wave. Statistical analysis indicates that at the maximum fundamental-wave power in the multi-longitudinal-mode regime, the standard deviation and peak-to-valley values derived from the normalized temporal profile decrease from 0.6122 and 5.6846 for the fundamental wave to 0.189 and 0.8847 for the residual fundamental wave. Meanwhile, the background level of the intensity auto-correlation function rises from ~0.72 to ~0.96, revealing its evolution toward a more coherent state. To the best of our knowledge, this research presents the first demonstration of laser temporal stabilization and correlation enhancement via second-harmonic generation. It not only deepens the comprehension of second-harmonic generation mechanisms, but also opens up a new avenue for realizing temporal beam self-cleaning of light."}

In this work, we demonstrate a Spintronic Poisson (SP) bolometer enabling room-temperature ultra-broadband sensing across 3-14 um. Unlike conventional bolometers that rely on continuous analog signals, the SP bolometer implements a Poisson-counting detection paradigm, encoding temperature in discrete stochastic events, which turns thermal noise from a limitation into the basis of the estimator itself. We fabricate the SP bolometer using a spintronic transduction layer integrated with a plasmonic nanoantenna array to enhance broadband infrared absorption. Using spintronic transduction, the device achieves the noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD, thermal sensitivity metric) of 80-100 mK at 300 K, surpassing uncooled detectors and approaching cooled technologies.

Among these, the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted MPGD technologies. Despite their widespread adoption, GEM detectors based on the conventional bi-conical hole geometry do not always achieve optimal performance, particularly in maximizing effective gain while suppressing ion backflow. One of the primary factors limiting a GEM's performance is ion backflow. The accumulation and gradual discharge of these ions might alter the local electric field, resulting in a temporary dead time and complicating responses to subsequent events. These limitations pose challenges for applications requiring high precision and stable long-term operation. In this work, we address these issues by investigating modified GEM geometries designed to enhance gain performance and reduce ion backflow, thereby improving overall detector performance. The current study investigates geometric optimization strategies for a triple-GEM detector to enhance performance, mitigate ion backflow, and augment gain. The detector structures were designed using the ANSYS Mechanical APDL, and the associated electrostatic field configurations were computed using the ANSYS Maxwell. A thorough investigation of gain and ion backflow calculations was carried out when the generated field maps were interfaced with Garfield$^{++}$.

Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces. Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms.

Methods for measuring radon emanation are well-established but have predominantly focused on the 222Rn isotope, the dominant radon isotope for these backgrounds. However, measurements of 220Rn (thoron), the second most abundant radon isotope, remain relatively unexplored. 220Rn emanation measurements are challenging because the 220Rn must be transferred from the emanation chamber to the active detector within its short 55 s half-life. In this study, a direct in-chamber approach for measuring 220Rn emanation is presented in which the sample is placed directly within the active detector chamber, thereby minimising losses during transfer. The method was demonstrated with a DURRIDGE RAD8 electrostatic radon detector, which measured 220Rn emanation from low-activity thoriated rods with an activity of 76 +/- 20 mBq. Compared with a conventional flowthrough 220Rn emanation setup, the in-chamber method increased sensitivity by a factor of 3. Using helium as the carrier gas provided a further sensitivity increase, giving an overall sensitivity gain of ~5. These results indicate that in-chamber 220Rn emanation measurements provide an effective tool for low-background experiments and have the potential to accelerate radon studies by exploiting the shorter half-life of 220Rn."}

We demonstrate that mass asymmetry sets the overall transmission profile, including the angular distribution and the resonance channels. In contrast, we show that quantum geometry provides a universal parameter that modulates tunneling efficiency by tuning the quantum distance, while leaving the energy dispersion unchanged. Specifically, quantum geometry plays a dual role: it governs the overall transmission amplitude through pseudospin mismatch, while its interplay with Fabry-Perot interference induces observable shifts in resonance angles. Our findings reveal that incorporating quantum geometry alongside band structure is essential for a complete description of quantum transport."}

In this work, we systematically explore whether a Peres-type criterion can be established for EPR steering in the two-qubit system. Focusing on rank-2 (including rank-1) states and the two-qubit Werner state, we analyze the eigenvalues of their partially transposed density matrices and construct a significant steering criterion based on symmetric combinations of these eigenvalues. We prove that this criterion serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for steerability for the Werner state, all two-qubit pure states, all two-qubit rank-2 states.

To address this point, we constrain deviations from general relativity across the plunge-merger-ringdown stage of spin-precessing binaries with a parametrized waveform model within the effective-one-body formalism. We find that deviations from the peak gravitational-wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the $(\\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$ mode are constrained to about $10\\%$ and $4\\%$, respectively, at $90\\%$ credible level.

These results are the most precise tests of general relativity in the nonlinear regime to date, and can be employed to constrain extensions of Einsten's theory."}

However, it is not possible to visualize the rapid growth dynamics using conventional imaging techniques. In this study, we demonstrate in-situ real-time observation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) growth dynamics at the single-particle level using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). We employed a photoreduction method, which enables reliable control of AgNP formation by laser irradiation. By integrating a stand-alone tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical setup for photoreduction, we successfully captured real-time movies showing the nucleation and subsequent growth of AgNPs at the single-particle level. Furthermore, quantitative single-particle analysis revealed particle-to-particle variations in growth dynamics. The growth dynamics were further studied at different laser intensities, revealing intensity-dependent growth rates and the balance between nucleation and growth.

We propose a transformative approach: an information-theoretic framework grounded in bio-inspired Bayesian expected information gain that defines the first generic light encoder for computational spectrometers.

We validate this paradigm with the first generic encoder capable of dynamically reconfiguring its response matrices. Experiments show superior reconstruction fidelity across diverse spectral regimes, enabling tunable spectral encoding tailored to varied input features. An ultra-high resolution of 6 pm and a broad measurable bandwidth of 30 nm are experimentally validated.

This coupling exhibits pronounced graph topological features, and we design a graph neural network (GNN) to accurately abstract its inherent physics.

In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit.

In this theory, the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated with metric perturbations of polar and axial parities (\"isospectrality\") of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity no longer holds.

As a step in this direction, we present a systematic and numerically exact quantum dynamical study of cooperative reaction dynamics inside an optical microcavity. Using a hierarchy of model systems with increasing complexity, we elucidate how cavity-modified reactivity emerges from-and is highly sensitive to-subtle structural and environmental variations. Our models consist of optically dark reactive molecules, each represented by a symmetric double well potential, coupled to infrared-active non-reactive intramolecular or solvent vibrational modes, as well as their respective dissipative environments. Our results demonstrate that cavity-induced rate modifications arise from a delicate interplay among mode hybridization in strong-coupling regimes, the dynamical balance of all participating energy exchange processes, and quantum interference between multiple fluctuation-dissipation-mediated reaction pathways enabled by collective cavity coupling. By continuously tuning a single system parameter or introducing molecular collectivity, we observe qualitatively distinct rate modification profiles as functions of the cavity frequency, including resonant rate enhancement, resonant rate suppression, hybridization-induced peak splitting, and, notably, asymmetric Fano-type line shapes in which enhancement peaks and suppression dips coexist within a narrow resonance window, highlighting the important role of quantum interference in cavity-modified chemical reactivity."}

A. Müller as the \"drosophila of solid-state physics\", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides."}

Implementing these structures in a qubit architecture is expected to result in coherence times that scale exponentially with the lengths of the chains. To scale to longer systems, the phase differences between all superconducting segments in the chain need to be controlled. While this control has been demonstrated by using an external magnetic flux, ideally it can be achieved with control over intrinsic system parameters. In this work, we investigate whether the relevant phase differences can be tuned through the spin degree of freedom in each QD, or the chemical potential of the discrete bound states in the hybrid sections. We confirm that both these tuning knobs allow for controlling the phase difference in the couplings between neighbouring QDs, bypassing the requirement to tune an external flux. However, we find that the amplitude of the phase shifts can deviate from a discrete $π$-shift. We introduce a spatial variation in the spin-orbit field as a possible mechanism to explain the observed behaviour and comment on the consequences for experimentally creating long Kitaev chains."}

While high-purity electronic-grade diamond exhibits third-order nonlinear absorption, NV-doped samples display pronounced saturable absorption that strengthens with increasing defect concentration. Linear transmission spectroscopy reveals that, in addition to NV centers, the crystals host significant populations of H2 (NVN-) defect complexes whose absorption band partially overlaps the excitation wavelength. By correlating spectroscopic data with nonlinear measurements and modeling the response using an effective two-level system, we show that the observed saturation cannot be attributed solely to NV centers but arises from the combined contribution of NV-related and H2 defects. For the highly doped sample, we determine an effective linear absorption coefficient of alpha0 = 6.52 cm-1 and a saturation intensity of Is = 40.0 GW/cm2.

The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states."}

A phenomenological model with two parameters (transport momentum relaxation time $τ_{\\text{tr}}$ and quantum scattering time $τ_q$) is developed, accurately describing experimentally measured magnetoresistance over an unexpectedly wide range of magnetic fields (up to 3.5 T) and temperatures (from 2 K to 15 K). The model combines: (i) a quasiclassical density of states with a magnetic-field-dependent Gaussian broadening of Landau levels, (ii) a momentum relaxation time scaling with the density of states, and (iii) oscillations of the Fermi level at a fixed electron density. This model reproduces V-shaped oscillation minima with zero-resistance points, a smooth background of positive magnetoresistance, and enables the extraction of $τ_q$ and $τ_{\\text{tr}}$ even in microstructures where ballistic and viscous effects dominate at low fields.

Determining how much deformation remains at present is crucial for gravitational-wave astronomy. This study is the first investigation into the evolution of quadrupole deformation during the solid crust formation phase to obtain a plausible value at present. The equilibrium structure before solidification is modeled using a fluid description, and the deformation is introduced through an assumed driving force. As the star cools, this force weakens, leading to a gradual decay of the deformation. Eventually, the deformation vanishes in the fluid region but partially remains in the crust, sustained by elastic forces, after solidification. By comparing the equilibrium models before and after solidification, we estimate the residual ellipticity and demonstrate that the spatial profile of the elastic shear is imprinted in the crust. The relic ellipticity is only a few percent of the original value, with its absolute magnitude depending on the deformation mechanism during the hot era, which cannot be specified owing to the lack of elaborate models. This work provides a first step toward linking early neutron star deformation with future gravitational-wave observations."}

The linear perturbation analysis is performed in the background Æther-orthogonal frame, in which the axes of the gravitational wave sound cones remain perpendicular to these hypersurfaces, thereby simplifying the analysis. The leading-order results show that Einstein-Æther theory admits two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode, consistent with the findings in the flat spacetime background. We further derive the dispersion relations and linear stability conditions for these modes in curved backgrounds. At next-to-leading order, we obtain the amplitude evolution equations, finding that the graviton number is conserved for the tensor modes but not for the vector and scalar modes. Next-to-leading-order effects also induce mixing among polarization modes. Our study demonstrates that, after imposing the GW170817 constraint on the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the vector modes mixed with the leading-order tensor modes cannot be used to distinguish between general relativity and Einstein-Æther theory. On the other hand, the mixing between scalar modes and the leading-order tensor modes leads to distinct predictions in the two theories, providing a promising avenue to test Einstein-Æther gravity through the detection of polarization mixing in gravitational waves."}

These moving-load solutions serve as building blocks for constructing more general loading scenarios via linear superposition. Based on Green's functions, an inverse problem is formulated to reconstruct the unknown surface traction responsible for a given surface displacement. The inverse analysis is performed through a Fourier-domain inversion with regularization, which enables a direct and computationally efficient determination of the contact pressure without iterative forward simulations. This framework is applied to a rigid wheel-ground contact problem, where the imposed displacement is dictated by the wheel geometry. The reconstructed surface traction exhibits a smooth, symmetric distribution within the contact region, while the resulting subsurface stress fields are obtained in closed analytical form and involve dilogarithm functions. The principal stress difference reveals characteristic spatial patterns similar to photoelastic fringes, and their asymmetry increases with the Mach number, reflecting the dynamic nature of the moving contact."}

Here, we propose a unified theoretical framework for the CCI states in MATBG that successfully explains most experimental observations. The key insight of our theory is that, due to the very narrow bandwidth of MATBG, correlation-enhanced valley and spin Zeeman terms are critical for shaping the intricate Hofstadter spectrum, resulting in an interwoven, flavor-resolved (spin and valley) Hofstadter spectrum that can well describe the observed CCI states. Crucially, due to the Zeeman effect, the crossings between these flavor-polarized Hofstadter spectra are magnetic-field-dependent, causing certain CCI states to emerge only above a critical field. This is the main mechanism underlying the critical field phenomenon of the CCI states observed in experiments. Our theory provides a clear and unified physical picture for the correlated Hofstadter spectrum in MATBG."}

In quantum measurement, amplifier operation is conventionally optimized in the linear regime by maximizing signal-to-noise ratio, an objective that is well-suited to parameter estimation but is typically insufficient for more general tasks such as arbitrary quantum state discrimination. Here we show that single-shot quantum state classification can benefit from operating a quantum amplifier outside the linear regime, when the measurement chain is optimized end-to-end for a task-specific cost function. We analyze a realistic superconducting readout architecture that includes state preparation, cryogenic nonlinear amplification, and room-temperature detection with finite noise. By introducing performance metrics tailored to state discrimination, we identify operating regimes in which nonlinear amplification provides a measurable advantage and clarify the trade-offs that ultimately limit classification fidelity. Our results propose the utility of practical nonlinear quantum amplifiers for quantum state discrimination, and are the first step in a broader research program aimed at developing a general framework for end-to-end, resource-limited optimization of nonlinear quantum amplifiers for such quantum information processing applications."}

Gravitational-wave observations from LIGO and Virgo have shown evidence of a previously unknown black hole mass range, which provides new information to update the entropy budget. Increases in entropy due to binary black hole mergers, as implied in the second law of thermodynamics, should also be added to the budget. In this study, we update the cosmological entropy budget for black holes in the stellar to lite-intermediate-mass range $(5-300~M_\\odot)$, originating from either supernovae or binary mergers, by utilizing a suite of population synthesis models and phenomenological fits derived from numerical relativity. We report three new insights: Firstly, the cumulative entropy from merging black holes surpasses the total entropy from cosmic microwave background photons around the onset of the Over-massive Black Hole Galaxy phase at $z\\sim 12$, suggesting that mergers played a more significant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe than relic radiation. Secondly, if primordial black holes constitute a nonzero fraction of dark matter, their early binary mergers establish an ``entropy floor\" in the Dark Ages and can dominate the cumulative merger-generated entropy history even for small abundances. Thirdly, by computing the cosmological density parameters, we highlight the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where the production of gravitational-wave energy is inefficient compared to the immense generation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy."}

We construct a stationary, axisymmetric ansatz via the Newman-Janis algorithm to model the kinematic features of a rotating black hole subject to Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP) corrections. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that in the infrared-dominated regime, the Hawking temperature scales as $T_H \\sim M^{-3}$, leading to a rapid cooling phase that significantly prolongs the lifetime of supermassive black holes. We derive the modified Teukolsky Master Equation for gravitational perturbations and demonstrate that the background geometry preserves the isospectrality between axial and polar modes.

In this theory, the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated with metric perturbations of polar and axial parities (\"isospectrality\") of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity no longer holds. How does this loss of isospectrality translate into the time-domain ringdown of gravitational waves? Given such a ringdown, can we identify the two \"fundamental quasinormal modes\" associated to the two metric-perturbation parities? We study these questions through a large suite of time-domain numerical simulations, by a prescription on how to relate the gauge-invariant master functions that describe metric perturbations of each parity with the gravitational polarizations. Under the assumptions made in our calculations, we find that it is in general difficult to identify either of the two fundamental modes from the time series, although finding evidence for a non-general-relativistic mode is possible sometimes. We discuss our results in light of our assumptions and speculate about what may occur when they are relaxed."}

Their development has had a transformative impact on optics and physics, and they remain the central platform for both fundamental discoveries and practical photonic technologies. However, the relatively large footprint and substrate-bound nature of photonic crystal structures have so far strongly limited their use as miniature optical devices or biointegrated sensors. Here, we overcome these limitations by identifying the minimal size of a 2D photonic crystal array needed to achieve lasing and describe the fabrication of substrate-less hexagonal laser particles with an active area as small as 30 μm2. Massively parallel fabrication, robust detachment, and integration of the nanolaser particles into live cells is demonstrated. Crucially, by engineering spatial and spectral mode characteristics, we designed NIR-II probes with mode volumes on the order of tens of attolitres, an order of magnitude smaller than whispering gallery probes of similar dimensions. Such high light localization is comparable in scale to different organelles of eucaryotic cells. In the future, we expect that chemical or plasmonic functionalization of the device will enable label-free sensing of nanoscale intracellular processes, and that it shall serve as a miniature platform to exploit developments in optical and quantum sensing for chemical and biological applications."}

We extend previous formulations of parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT) by including fermionic displacement operators in the variational Ansatz. Unlike PP-FMFT, PV-FMFT can be applied to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, describe quenches from arbitrary initial spin-1/2 product states, and compute local and non-local observables in a straight-forward manner at the same modest computational cost as PP-FMFT -- scaling as $O(N^3)$ in the worst case for a system of $N$ spins or fermionic modes. We demonstrate that PV-FMFT can exactly capture the imaginary- and real-time dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. We then study the post quench-dynamics of the one- and two-dimensional Ising model in presence of longitudinal and transversal fields with PV-FMFT and compute the single site magnetization and correlation functions, and compare them against results from other state-of-the-art numerical approaches. In two-dimensional spin systems, we show that the employed spin-to-fermion mapping can break rotational symmetry within the PV-FMFT description, and we discuss the resulting consequences for the calculated correlation functions.

A key strategy to understand and design these phases is to map Chern bands onto Landau levels (LLs). Here, we introduce a universal framework that variationally decomposes Bloch bands into generalized LLs, providing a controlled and quantitative characterization of their effective LL nature. Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moiré Hamiltonians, we find that the first moiré valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moiré band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $ν_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $θ= 2.45^\\circ$ and $2.13^\\circ$. At $θ= 2.45^\\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $ν_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum.

To examine whether different device topologies show measurable differences, we study three geometries with distinct topological invariants: a Mobius strip, a loop, and a trefoil knot, which have been proposed in electronic-structure settings. From quantum capacitance measurements, we extract power versus frequency spectra and fit Lorentzian line shapes to obtain the linewidth, amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, and coherence time. The signal-to-noise ratio quantifies the ratio of the parity measurement signal to background noise and serves as an indicator of readout quality, while the coherence time characterizes the timescale for decoherence of the quantum state. Across all three topologies, coherence times are similar, with no clear dependence on geometry. In contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio differs in the regime E0 = 10 micro-eV and Z = -1, following the ordering Trefoil, Mobius, and Loop.

We introduce Residual Neural Likelihood Estimation (RNLE), a modification of Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE) that learns the likelihood of non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detector data. Exploiting the additive structure of the signal and noise generation processes, RNLE directly models the noise distribution, substantially reducing the number of simulations required for accurate parameter estimation and improving robustness to realistic noise artifacts. The performance of RNLE is demonstrated using a toy model, simulated gravitational-wave signals, and real detector noise from ground based interferometers. Even in the presence of loud non-Gaussian transients, glitches, we show that RNLE can achieve reliable parameter recovery when trained on appropriately constructed datasets. We further assess the stability of the method by quantifying the variability introduced by retraining the conditional density estimator on statistically identical datasets with different optimization seeds, referred to as training noise. This variability can be mitigated through an ensemble approach that combines multiple RNLE models using evidence-based weighting. An implementation of RNLE is publicly available in the sbilby package, enabling its deployment within gravitational-wave astronomy and a broad range of scientific applications requiring flexible, simulation-based likelihood estimation."}

The resulting Gaussian curvature integrates to $-2π$, independently of $σ$, and including the boundary contribution, yields Euler characteristic $χ=0$, corresponding to a punctured plane.

Spatial slices embed isometrically as helicoids, and geodesics exhibit a characteristic swirling motion.

They also offer intrinsic anisotropic optical properties, which can be used to shape and manipulate light even inside spatially highly symmetric structures. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed optical characterization of a spherical bipolar liquid crystal polymer microlaser that tightly confines the optical path of whispering gallery modes to the equatorial plane. By controlled anchoring of the liquid crystal mesogens followed by polymerization, a fixed refractive index gradient is formed within the spherical microcavity. Consequently, only transverse electric (TE) modes oscillating in the equatorial plane experience the high extraordinary refractive index, allowing to confine lasing into a single plane. Furthermore, we observe that the refractive index gradient causes a characteristic splitting of the TE modes. By combining hyperspectral imaging and analytical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed splitting is caused by lifting of the energy degeneracy of higher order azimuthal laser modes, enabling direct insights into the complex interplay of refractive index gradients and resulting whispering gallery mode confinement. In addition, the unique ability to confine lasing of a spherical microbead into only a single plane makes these microlasers independent of the exact position of the pump beam, which allows consistent localized sensing especially in combination with fast point scanning microscopes or inside highly dynamic biological environments."}

This gap persists even though, for more conventional light-matter interactions, the complex underlying electron dynamics can often be confined to a single Brillouin zone and described well within the dipole approximation. Previous studies were restricted to nonlinear, perturbative regimes, largely because the generation of intense ultrashort vortex pulses, particularly in the mid-infrared spectral regime, has remained a long-standing challenge. Consequently, the role of structured light in driving nonlinear, non-perturbative processes in solids, and the associated transfer of angular momentum during these interactions, has not been systematically explored. Here, we investigate solid-state high-harmonic generation (HHG) driven by intense ultrashort structured light using a versatile experimental approach applicable to different materials and geometries. We demonstrate that the OAM of the driving field is coherently transferred to the emitted harmonics. In particular, we show that the OAM is conserved independently of the crystal symmetry, the range of electronic interactions, and the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling.

This approach provides a physically viable interpretation of these analytic solutions, which (in general) admit no isometries, thus allowing, in principle, for modeling time and space varying 3-dimensional fields of peculiar velocities that can be contrasted with observational data on our local cosmography. As a ``proof of concept'' we examine the peculiar velocities of varying dark matter and dark energy perfect fluids with respect to the CMB frame using a simple, spherically symmetric particular solution.

In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory. Our findings establish a general framework for non-Hermitian higher-order photonic systems and open avenues toward tailorable topological photonic devices exploiting non-Hermitian enhanced localization."}

Using Negativity, Measurement-Induced Non-locality (MIN), Uncertainty-Induced Nonlocality (UIN), and Bell nonlocality (as quantified by the CHSH inequality) as measures, we analyze the interplay between anisotropy parameters, magnetic fields, and temperature on the survival of quantum correlations. Our results demonstrate that Bell nonlocality and entanglement (Negativity) are highly sensitive to temperature and anisotropy, exhibiting sudden death under thermal noise, whereas MIN and UIN are significantly more robust. In particular, these discord-like and information-theoretic measures provide the largest baseline and persist even in parameter regions where entanglement vanishes, highlighting their suitability as a quantumness witness in realistic conditions. Notably, our Bell nonlocality study is tailored to the asymmetric qubit-qutrit setting by exploiting a recently developed qubit-qudit CHSH maximization framework. However, Bell nonlocality is confirmed to be the most fragile, surviving only in narrow parameter windows at low temperature. A key finding of this work is that we observe the fragility hierarchy: Bell nonlocality < Negativity < UIN(MIN) in the qubit-qutrit setting. These results provide deeper insight into the relative robustness of distinct quantum resources in anisotropic qubit-qutrit models, suggesting that quantum discord-like measures, such as MIN and UIN, may serve as more practical resources than entanglement for quantum information tasks in thermally active spin systems."}

This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films."}

In this paper we prove that any Hamiltonian hosting such ``ferromagnetic scar states'' necessarily admits a structural decomposition into a Zeeman term and an ``annihilator'' that annihilates the entire scar manifold. Moreover, we show that this annihilator must itself decompose into a sum of terms built from local projectors that locally annihilate the scar states.

To eliminate the statistical errors due to variable and usually arbitrary sampling of the directions in a color point, we integrate the measures over a complete ellipsoid/ellipse. It turns out that in the limit for small deviations from circularity all proposed measures ($V_{AB}$, $γ-1$, $CV$ and $\\mathrm{STRESS}$) are equivalent. For greater deviations the measures become distinct with $γ-1$ the most sensitive and $\\mathrm{STRESS}$ the least. Ideally a difference measure should be coordinate independent and then it is advantageous to apply an affine transformation to both sets, e.g. turning the theoretical one into the unit ball. Although MacAdam already used this method but sampled the transformed ellipse, we integrate over the ellipsoid/ellipse. Comparing the results with the base measures we show that only $\\mathrm{STRESS}$ is coordinate independent. Judging whether a single ellipsoid/ellipse resembles a unit ball can easily be done by comparing the eigenvalues with one and we show that our previously proposed error measure $d_{ev}$ (Candry e.a. Optics Express, 30, 36307, 2022) is the eigenvalue version of $γ-1$. We show why the short lived correlation coefficient $r$ was justly abandoned, being very coordinate dependent, but that Pant's recent geometric measure $1-R$ on the other hand is coordinate independent. All measures are routinely made scale invariant by the introduction of a scaling parameter, to be optimized. Lastly we show that from all measures the $γ-1$ ones are the only ones permitting the simple derivation of the globally optimized difference measure from the locally defined ones."}

We demonstrate that, unlike its linear counterpart, the NSdH effect is highly sensitive to the spin textures that arise from SOI.

We demonstrate that the CQFI admits a decomposition into incoherent (population) and coherent (basis rotation) contributions, augmented by a transient interference cross-term absent at the ensemble level.

Leveraging this framework, we construct a stochastic information geometry that defines thermodynamic length and action for single quantum trajectories.

Here, we introduce a hybrid unified 3D printer that leverages the complementary strengths of both printing mechanisms to bridge this scale-resolution gap. We propose integrating 2PP for high-resolution, localized spatial control with single-photon TVAM for enabling rapid, high-throughput 3D fabrication. In this approach, TVAM first forms millimeter-scale volumetric structures attached on a glass rod, via overprinting, which is then accessible for subsequent high-resolution 2PP. Without needing to change the photoresin or introducing intermediate post-processing steps, we demonstrate finely printed structures via 2PP using a tightly focused femtosecond laser beam, fabricated both inside and on the surface of the millimeter-scale 3D objects printed with TVAM. Here, TVAM contributes by generating a pre-polymerized volume that facilitates subsequent 2PP and by directly driving volumetric polymerization in designated regions within seconds. We experimentally demonstrate that this dual-mode strategy provides a scalable approach for rapidly fabricating millimeter-scale 3D structures featuring sub-micrometer details. For applications like bioscaffolds and tissue engineering, tens of micrometer-scale features are sufficient across the majority of the volume with higher resolution confined to localized functional regions.

While understanding of the anomaly in bulk materials remains incomplete, a version of this anomaly can be found in an ensemble of two-site systems and hence has been predicted to be observable in parallel-coupled double quantum dots.

Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints. Machine learning based decoders offer fast GPU inference and flexible function approximation, yet many approaches do not explicitly exploit the lattice geometry and local structure of topological codes, which can limit performance. In this work, we propose QuantumSMoE, a quantum vision transformer based decoder that incorporates code structure through plus shaped embeddings and adaptive masking to capture local interactions and lattice connectivity, and improves scalability via a mixture of experts layer with a novel auxiliary loss.

Quantum chaos is traditionally characterized by spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, most notably through the spectral form factor, while the hardness of classical simulation within the stabilizer formalism, commonly referred to as quantum magic, can be quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy. In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer Rényi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition. We then demonstrate this relation explicitly in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, using an auxiliary-spin representation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy that exhibits an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry. We further find that, in the high-temperature regime of the SYK model, the transition occurs at a finite time, with the long-time phase marked by spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In contrast, at low temperatures, the transition is pushed to times exponentially long in the system size. Our results reveal an intriguing interplay between quantum chaos and quantum magic."}

The idea is simple yet decisive: a third-order expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the magnetic field reveals that the threefold component originates from the relative positions of the mirror planes in the crystals with respect to the measurement setups. Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals.

In sharp contrast, quantum teleportation displays an unavoidable, protocol-induced coherence cost that grows linearly with the number of teleported qubits and is independent of the input state. Through a stage-resolved analysis of the teleportation circuit, we separate protocol-generated coherence from message-dependent contributions and identify a universal two-bit coherence offset per teleported qubit at the maximal-coherence stage. We further demonstrate explicitly that this extensive intermediate coherence generation is fully consistent with information-theoretic bounds, including the Holevo limit, and does not correspond to an increase in accessible classical information."}

By leveraging a momentum-matched plasmonic coupling mechanism, the device maps vortex beams onto surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) with OAM-dependent splitting angles, thereby generating photocurrents that uniquely encode the topological charge. The incorporation of a surface dielectric lens and a split-electrode architecture further enhances mode resolution and enables chirality discrimination.

Source code and datasets available at https://github.com/AleynaCeyran/ParaQNN-Quantum-Decoherence", "summary": "Modeling the dynamics of open quantum systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices constitutes a major challenge, as high noise levels and environmental degradations lead to the decay of pure quantum states (decoherence) and energy losses. This situation represents one of the most important problems in the field of quantum information technologies. While existing data-driven methods struggle to generalize beyond the training data (extrapolation), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) require predefined governing equations, which limit their discovery capability when the underlying physics is incomplete or unknown. In this work, we present the ParaQNN (ParaQuantum neural network) architecture, an equation-free framework for physical discovery. ParaQNN disentangles multi-scale dynamics without relying on a priori laws by employing a dialetheist logic layer that models coherent signal and decoherent noise as independent yet interacting channels. Through extensive benchmark tests performed on Rabi oscillations, Lindblad dynamics, and particularly complex ``mixed regimes'' where relaxation and dephasing processes compete, we show that ParaQNN exhibits a consistent performance advantage compared to Random Forest, XGBoost, and PINN models with incomplete physical information. Unlike its competitors, ParaQNN succeeds in maintaining oscillatory and damping dynamics with high accuracy even in extrapolation regions where training data are unavailable, by ``discovering'' the underlying structural invariants from noisy measurements. These results demonstrate that paraconsistent logic provides a structurally more stable epistemic foundation than classical methods for learning quantum behavior in situations where mathematical equations prove insufficient."}

We study this question in an arena where computation, learning, and causality collide. A twist on Grover's search that reflects about an a priori unknown state can collapse the query complexity from $O(\\sqrt{N})$ to $O(\\log N)$ over a search space $N$, i.e., an exponential speedup. Yet, standard quantum theory forbids such a unknown-state reflection (no-reflection theorem). We therefore build a state-learning-assisted architecture, called ``amplify-learn,'' which alternates the coherent amplitude amplification with state learning. Embedding this amplify-learn into the Bao-Bouland-Jordan no-signaling framework, we show that the logarithmic-round dream would open a super-luminal communication channel unless each round expends the learning-sample and reflection-circuit budgets scaling at least as $Ω(\\sqrt{N}/\\log N)$. In parallel, we derive tight computational learning-theoretic sample bounds for learning circuit-generated pure states, revealing a state-universal ansatz ``lock'' at order $N$ in the worst case. The dramatic closure is that no-signaling does not merely veto the unphysical primitive, but it fixes the only consistent reflection-circuit complexity, and feeding this causality-enforced complexity into the computational learning bound makes it collapse onto the very same $\\sqrt{N}/\\log N$ scaling demanded by no-signaling alone. No-signaling thus acts as a regulator of learnability: a constraint that mediates between physics and computation, welding query, gate, and sample complexities into a single causality-compatible triangle."}

Using a spinful Rice--Mele model, we show that a stationary LV background induces a momentum-odd correction to the Bloch Hamiltonian, which generates an odd-in-field contribution to the shift current. This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear optical responses offer a practical and symmetry-selective route for probing LV effects in solid-state systems."}

By free, we mean that there is no potential within the interval and that its walls are penetrable; hence, the pertinent energy current density does not vanish at the walls. Certainly, quantization in an interval is not trivial because certain restrictions imposed by the domains of the operators involved arise. Here, our objective is to obtain the Hamiltonian for these particles. In practice, the Feshbach-Villars (FV)--free Hamiltonian is the proper operator for characterizing them and is a function of the momentum operator. Additionally, a Majorana condition must also be imposed on the wavefunctions on which these two operators can act. Thus, we start by calculating the pseudo self-adjoint momentum operator. A three-parameter set of boundary conditions (BCs) constitutes its domain. Up to this point, the domain of the Hamiltonian is induced by the domain of the momentum operator; however, we ensure that only the BCs for which the energy current density has the same value at each end of the interval are in its domain. All these BCs essentially belong to a one-parameter set of BCs. Moreover, because the FV equation is invariant under the operation of parity, the parity-transformed wavefunction is also a solution of this equation, which further restricts the domain of the free FV Hamiltonian. Finally, knowing the most general three-parameter set of BCs for the pseudo self-adjoint FV Hamiltonian for a 1D KFGM particle in an interval, we find that only two BCs can remain within the domain of the FV--free Hamiltonian: the periodic BC and the antiperiodic BC. These BCs are satisfied by both the two-component FV wavefunction, with these components being related, and the one-component KFG wavefunction, which can be real or imaginary."}

Recent advances in atomic-scale tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) have enabled vibrational mapping of single molecules with sub-nanometer spatial resolution, providing unprecedented insights into molecule-surface interactions by confining light in plasmonic picocavities. Here, we exploit TERS in a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope junction to perform Raman hyperspectral mapping of single iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules in three non-equivalent adsorption configurations on Ag surfaces. We explore the changes in the vibrational modes of FePc molecules adsorbed on two distinct silver crystal terminations with differing symmetry, Ag(111) and Ag(110), revealing how subtle variations in the adsorption geometry due to substrate anisotropy can strongly influence molecular vibrations, lifting the degeneracy of individual normal modes. Our findings not only demonstrate the first use of sub-nanometer TERS mapping across different symmetry configurations but also provide a deeper understanding of how site-specific vibrational properties are intimately linked to local atomic environments. This capability paves the way for precisely tailoring surface interactions and controlling chemical reactions at the atomic scale."}

Quantum chaos is traditionally characterized by spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, most notably through the spectral form factor, while the hardness of classical simulation within the stabilizer formalism, commonly referred to as quantum magic, can be quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy. In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer Rényi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition. We then demonstrate this relation explicitly in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, using an auxiliary-spin representation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy that exhibits an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry. We further find that, in the high-temperature regime of the SYK model, the transition occurs at a finite time, with the long-time phase marked by spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In contrast, at low temperatures, the transition is pushed to times exponentially long in the system size. Our results reveal an intriguing interplay between quantum chaos and quantum magic."}

III-VI semiconductors possess a rare property in the class of multilayered semiconductors, which is that their fundamental excitons are oriented out-of-plane. This allows them to exhibit phenomena such as transparency in the visible range while also being emissive in the visible and near-infrared ranges.

We achieved a well-controlled QD coverage of the rGO sheets by functionalizing the rGO surface with mercapto-silane linkers. A further spectroscopic investigation of near-infrared PbS QD-rGO materials demonstrates efficient electronic coupling between both materials. The QD photoluminescence emission quenching and exciton lifetime shortening up to 95%, together with subtle graphene Raman G-band shifts upon QD linking, supports electron transfer as the dominant relaxation pathway from the QD to the rGO.

We identify the dominant coupling channels and characterize their observable signatures in the QD response. We predict strong linear energy shifts under volumetric strain and quadratic behavior under shear strain, especially in GaAs QDs. The piezoelectric effect is dominated by polarizability, which also leads to a quadratic response. The simulations show energy modulations up to 0.7 meV for an acoustic wave with 0.1 nm amplitude. The quadratic response to shear strain and piezoelectric field leads to frequency doubling in the QD response to a mechanical wave and to non-harmonic time traces when linear and quadratic effects contribute to a similar degree.

The platform is modular, where each three-mode optomechanical system serves as a fundamental building block. Operating independently, a single block achieves nonreciprocity for classical fields. Specifically, asymmetric radiation pressure from intrinsic optomechanical nonlinearity induces nonreciprocal mechanical displacement, modulating the cavity intensity through optomechanical feedback. This enables full isolation of backward transmission without requiring parameter initialization. Alternatively, for quantum signals, the platform is reconfigured by activating photonic and phononic exchange channels between the two blocks. In this configuration, nonreciprocity arises from quantum interference between direct photon hopping and indirect conversion pathways. Constructive interference enables unidirectional low-loss transmission, while destructive interference completely suppresses the reverse direction. After adiabatically eliminating the auxiliary modes, the optimal nonreciprocal frequency and the trade-off between insertion loss and nonreciprocal bandwidth can be controlled by engineering optomechanically induced mechanical dissipation. Additionally, the three-mode-based device requires less control-field power than two-mode systems under resolved-sideband conditions, demonstrating versatile potential for optical nonreciprocity applications across classical and quantum domains."}

In the weak-coupling regime, the BIC dominates, enabling perfect and persistent information storage. At stronger coupling, all bound states contribute, leading to oscillatory behavior and reduced storage fidelity.

The potential arises from the image charges that form in the grounded planes, along with the added condition that at x = 0, L, where L is the distance between the planes, the wavefunction must be zero. This effectively couples a hydrogen like system to a particle-in-a-box (PIB) based on L, the distance between the planes. The problem of finding the electrostatic potential of this infinite series of image charges is an old one, going back to at least 1929. Here, we give a short derivation for one of the limiting cases that yields a compact expression and show how the Kellogg infinite summation formula converges to that value. We note here that this potential is a symmetric double well potential, so there will be many familiar properties of its solutions. Then using that potential, we solve Schrödinger's equation using a spectral technique. The limiting forms of a particle in a box for small L (and high E), and that of a (degenerate) bound image charge at large L and small energy are recovered.

Using Negativity, Measurement-Induced Non-locality (MIN), Uncertainty-Induced Nonlocality (UIN), and Bell nonlocality (as quantified by the CHSH inequality) as measures, we analyze the interplay between anisotropy parameters, magnetic fields, and temperature on the survival of quantum correlations. Our results demonstrate that Bell nonlocality and entanglement (Negativity) are highly sensitive to temperature and anisotropy, exhibiting sudden death under thermal noise, whereas MIN and UIN are significantly more robust. In particular, these discord-like and information-theoretic measures provide the largest baseline and persist even in parameter regions where entanglement vanishes, highlighting their suitability as a quantumness witness in realistic conditions. Notably, our Bell nonlocality study is tailored to the asymmetric qubit-qutrit setting by exploiting a recently developed qubit-qudit CHSH maximization framework. However, Bell nonlocality is confirmed to be the most fragile, surviving only in narrow parameter windows at low temperature. A key finding of this work is that we observe the fragility hierarchy: Bell nonlocality < Negativity < UIN(MIN) in the qubit-qutrit setting. These results provide deeper insight into the relative robustness of distinct quantum resources in anisotropic qubit-qutrit models, suggesting that quantum discord-like measures, such as MIN and UIN, may serve as more practical resources than entanglement for quantum information tasks in thermally active spin systems."}

Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations.

In this interferometric framework, we present entropic wave-particle duality relations between quantum coherence, characterized by the relative entropy of coherence of the quanton state, and which-path knowledge, quantified by the mutual information obtained through detector-state discrimination. By applying a general optimal discrimination measurement, which has a closed-form solution and encompasses other fundamental strategies as special cases, we provide an exact quantification of which-path knowledge in a variety of scenarios. This measurement is carried out in two steps. First, an optimal separation map with a prescribed separation level $ξ\\in [0,1]$ probabilistically reduces the overlaps between the input detector states with maximum success rate, or increases them in case of failure. Then, a minimum-error (ME) measurement discriminates either only the successful outputs (standard approach) or both the successful and failure outputs (concatenated approach). We show that the duality relation is tighter at $ξ=0$, where both approaches reduce to the ME measurement. For $ξ>0$, each approach yields a distinct relation that becomes less tight as $ξ$ increases, with the concatenated one providing the tighter bound. Finally, by using the discrete uncertainty principle, we determine the sets of detector states that lead to saturation of the duality relation, showing that they span $n$-dimensional subspaces of the detector space, where $n$ divides $N$. As a result, nontrivial saturation occurs only for interferometers with a nonprime number of paths. From the identified saturating sets, we highlight how the quanton-detector correlations underlie this phenomenon."}

A. Müller as the \"drosophila of solid-state physics\", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides."}

Our platform employs a bulk lithium niobate crystal whose large dielectric constant creates wavelength-scale confinement of microwave photons. By incorporating this crystal within a high-finesse Fabry - Perot optical cavity, microwave photons couple to optical photons through the electro-optic effect. We demonstrate the ability to tune our system into triply resonant operation, where microwave photons, optical pump photons, and upconverted optical photons are simultaneously resonant with high quality factor electromagnetic modes of the system. The device achieves photon number conversion efficiency at the percent level, comparable to state-of-the-art devices at room temperature -- sufficient to resolve the thermal occupation of the microwave mode -- while avoiding the noise and loss associated with metal electrodes. These results establish our all-dielectric devices as a promising platform for high-precision sensing of optically detected microwave fields and as a viable route toward single-photon-level microwave - optical quantum transduction."}

Among randomly initialized models with identical architecture, approximately one-third show performance improvement under moderate noise, while a smaller fraction deteriorate and the remainder are marginally affected. We identify a strong negative correlation ($r = -0.62$) between baseline model performance and noise benefit, suggesting that noise acts as an implicit regularizer for under-optimized models while disrupting well-converged ones. The observed optimal noise level falls below theoretical predictions, indicating error cancellation in structured quantum circuits.

One method of fault-tolerant state preparation is to initialize multiple ancilla states and check them against each other to detect problematic errors. In the worst case, the number of states required for successful initialization grows polynomially with the code distance, but it has been shown that this can be reduced to constant ancilla overhead-in the best case, only four states are required. However, existing techniques for finding low-overhead initialization schemes are limited to codes with large symmetry groups, such as the Golay code. In this work, we propose a general, automated synthesis methodology for Steane-type fault-tolerant state preparation circuits that applies to arbitrary Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes and does not rely on code symmetries. We apply the proposed methods to various CSS codes up to a distance of seven and simulate the successful fault-tolerant initialization of logical basis states under circuit-level depolarizing noise.

Complementarily, we obtain certified upper bounds on fidelity by variational lower bounds on the trace distance through the same framework. We demonstrate the power of this approach with two examples: fidelity correlators in critical mixed states, and codeword distinguishability in an approximate quantum error-correcting code. Remarkably, the variational lower bound accurately track the universal scaling behavior of the fidelity with a size-consistent relative error, allowing for the extraction of previously unknown critical exponents.

Here, we analyze memory effects in these processes -- examining the evolution of quantum states and of observables -- through witnesses of non-Markovianity for open quantum systems. We focus on discrete-time reset processes, which are of particular interest as they can be implemented on existing gate-operated quantum devices.

We analyze how the two main fusion operations, Type-I and Type-II, act on weighted graph states. Type-I fusion operates identically to the unweighted case, merging two one-dimensional weighted graphs, while preserving edge weights and success probabilities. In addition, the pool of 2-qubit weighted graph states can be generated easily by GHZ states or Bell pairs. In contrast, Type-II fusion requires a logical qubit, which can be formed only for specific weight configurations, and with success probability below one-half, which is an obstacle one can avoid. When successful, it fuses the states correctly, but its failure outcomes destroy the structure of the graphs, removing the good-failure feature, known from ordinary graph states. We compute the entanglement reduction of the resulting link due to the fused states being weighted graph states (for generalized fusion), and classify the resulting states of a general non-Bell projection. These results define the practical limits of the fusion-based construction of weighted graph states for MBQC."}

Instead of accumulating at the physical boundary, all eigenmodes become compressed and skewed within a finite spatial range determined by the inhomogeneous profile-a phenomenon we term the confined non-Hermitian skin effect. Consequently, the evolution of the probability distribution on the lattice starting from a single site is doubly confined: it is spatially bounded to a finite range by the inhomogeneous coupling, and further restricted to a one-sided trajectory at the edge of this range by the non-reciprocity.

Despite recent progress, a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental precision limits of continuous metrology with bosonic systems is currently lacking. We develop a general theoretical framework for quantum metrology with multimode free bosons under continuous Gaussian measurements. We derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic growth rates of the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the environmental QFI, which quantify the total information encoded in the joint system-environment state and the information accessible from the emitted radiation, respectively. We derive fundamental bounds on these quantities, showing that while Heisenberg-type scaling with the number of modes is attainable, the precision scales at most linearly with time and a meaningful energy resource. To illustrate our findings, we analyze several concrete setups, including coupled cavity arrays and trapped particle arrays. While a local setup yields a standard linear scaling with resources, a globally coupled setup can achieve the optimal quadratic scaling in terms of the mode number. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a nonreciprocal setup can leverage the non-Hermitian skin effect to realize an exponentially enhanced global QFI. Notably, however, this enhancement cannot be reflected in the environmental QFI, highlighting a fundamental distinction between the information stored within the joint state and the information radiated into the environment.

Integrated photonics offers a scalable solution, yet a critical spectral gap persists. Although telecom-band integrated photon-pair sources are well established, near-visible photons offer distinct advantages for satellite-to-ground links by mitigating diffraction loss and maximizing the collection efficiency of optical telescopes. Scalable integrated sources in this regime have remained elusive due to the fundamental challenge of achieving anomalous dispersion in materials transparent at visible wavelengths. Here we bridge this gap by demonstrating an integrated near-visible photon-pair source based on a wide-bandgap, ultralow-loss, silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) microresonator. By engineering the dispersion of higher-order waveguide modes, we overcome the intrinsic normal dispersion limit to achieve efficient phase matching.

Measurement-free quantum error correction (mfec) replaces repeated measurements and classical feed-forward by coherent quantum feedback, but existing mfec protocols suffer from severe connectivity overhead when mapped to planar surface-code architectures: transversal interactions between logical patches require SWAP chains of length $O(d)$ in the code distance, which increase depth and generate hook errors. This work introduces a 3D stacked surface-code architecture for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction that removes this connectivity bottleneck. Vertical transversal couplers between aligned surface-code patches enable coherent parity mapping and feedback with zero SWAP overhead, realizing constant-depth $O(1)$ inter-layer operations in d while preserving local 2D stabilizer checks. A fault-tolerant mfec protocol for the surface code is constructed that suppresses hook errors under realistic noise. An analytical performance model shows that the 3D architecture overcomes the readout error floor and achieves logical error rates orders of magnitude below both standard measurement-based surface codes and 2D mfec variants in regimes with slow, noisy measurements, identifying 3D integration as a key enabler for scalable measurement-free fault tolerance."}

To this end, efficient single-photon sources and spin-photon interfaces have been implemented by integrating color centers or erbium dopants into nanophotonic resonators. However, the optical emission frequencies in this approach are subject to temporal fluctuations on both long and short timescales, which hinders the development of quantum applications. Here, we investigate this limitation and demonstrate that it can be alleviated by integrating the emitters into Fabry-Perot instead of nanophotonic resonators. Their larger optical mode volume enables both increasing the distance to crystal surfaces and operating at a lower dopant concentration, which reduces implantation-induced crystal damage and interactions between emitters. As a result, we observe a fivefold reduction of the spectral diffusion linewidth down to 4.0(2) MHz. Calculations and experimental investigations of isotopically purified 28-Si crystals suggest that the remaining spectral instability is caused by laser-induced electric-field fluctuations. In direct comparison with a nanophotonic device, the instability is significantly reduced at the same intracavity power, enabling a tenfold increase of the optical coherence time up to 20(1) microseconds.

Quantum amplitude encoding methods encode the multi-variate normal distribution in the amplitudes of a quantum state. This work presents the Quantum Box-Muller transform which creates a superposition of binary-encoded grid points representing the multi-variate normal distribution. The gate complexity of our method depends on quantum arithmetic operations and, using a specific set of known implementations, the complexity is quadratic in the number of qubits. We apply our method to Monte-Carlo integration, in particular to the estimation of the expectation value of a function of Gaussian random variables. Our method implies that the state preparation circuit used multiple times in amplitude estimation requires only quantum arithmetic circuits for the grid points and the function, in addition to a single controlled rotation. We show how to provide the expectation value estimate with an error that is exponentially small in the number of qubits, similar to the amplitude-encoding setting with error-free encoding."}

Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is widely used to generate photon pairs for heralded single-photon sources, but intrinsic spectral correlations of the pairs often limit the purity and interference visibility of the heralded photons. Existing approaches to suppress these correlations rely on narrowband spectral filtering, which introduces loss, or exploiting different polarizations, which complicates on-chip integration. Here, we demonstrate a new strategy for generating spectrally separable photon pairs in thin-film lithium niobate nanophotonic circuits by harnessing higher-order spatial modes, with all interacting fields residing in the same polarization. Spectral separability is achieved by engineering group-velocity matching using higher-order transverse-electric modes, combined with a Gaussian-apodized poling profile to further suppress residual correlations inherent to standard periodic poling. Subsequent on-chip mode conversion with efficiency exceeding 95\\% maps the higher-order mode to the fundamental mode and routes the photons into distinct output channels. The resulting heralded photons exhibit spectral purities exceeding 94\\% inferred from joint-spectral intensity and 89\\% from unheralded $g^{(2)}$ measurement. This approach enables flexible spectral and temporal engineering of on-chip quantum light sources for quantum computing and quantum networking."}

Its applicability, however, is challenged by the existence of anomalous bunching, namely paradoxical situations in which partially distinguishable particles exhibit a higher bunching probability in two or more modes than perfectly indistinguishable ones. Using multimode bunching as a reliable criterion of genuine indistinguishability, therefore, requires a clear identification of the interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching can or cannot occur. In particular, since uncontrolled small time delays between single-photon pulses constitute a common source of mode mismatch in current photonic platforms, it is essential to determine whether the resulting photon distinguishability might lead to anomalous bunching. Here, we first identify a broad class of interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching is rigorously excluded, thereby establishing regimes where multimode bunching-based validation remains valid. Then, we find that, quite unexpectedly, temporal mode mismatch does not belong to this class. We exhibit a specific interferometric setup in which temporal distinguishability enhances multimode bunching, demonstrating that time delays can induce an anomalous behavior. These results help clarify the conditions under which multimode bunching remains a reliable validation tool."}

We report bright heralded single-photon superradiance via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1-mm-long, high-density cesium vapor cell. By reducing the average distance between atoms in the atomic vapor to 0.29 times the idler photon wavelength, we observe a dramatic narrowing of the temporal two-photon wavefunction. This compression of temporal two-photon wavefunction evidences the superradiance of heralded photons in the collective two-photon emission dynamics.

We propose the Distributed Variational Quantum Algorithm (DVQA) to overcome these limitations, enabling the solution of 1,000-variable instances on constrained hardware. A key innovation of DVQA is its use of the truncated higher-order singular value decomposition to preserve inter-variable dependencies without relying on complex long-range entanglement, leading to a natural form of noise localization where errors scale with subsystem size rather than total qubit count, thus reconciling scalability with accuracy. Theoretical bounds confirm the algorithm's robustness for p-local Hamiltonians.

In other words, we construct families of fully classical, i.e. commuting, measurements that nevertheless can be used to show contextuality of quantum theory. To overcome the apparent disagreement between the two notions of classicality, that is commutativity and noncontextuality, we propose a modified definition of generalised contextuality for continuous-variable systems. The modified definition is based on a physically-motivated approximation procedure, that uses only finite sets of measurement effects. We prove that in the limiting case this definition corresponds exactly to an extension of noncontextual models that benefits from non-constructive response functions.

The skin effect, induced by non-reciprocal dissipation, localizes relaxation modes near the system boundaries and gives rise to non-orthogonal spectral geometry. While such non-normality is often linked to slow relaxation, we show that it can instead accelerate relaxation through a two-step protocol - realizing a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional open chain with coherent hopping $J$, asymmetric incoherent hoppings $J_{\\rm R} \\neq J_{\\rm L}$, and a controllable end-to-end coupling $ε$. For $ε=0$, the system exhibits the Liouvillian skin effect, with left and right eigenmodes localized at opposite edges. We compare two relaxation protocols toward the same stationary state: (i) a direct relaxation with $ε=0$, and (ii) a two-step (Pontus) protocol where a brief coherent evolution transfers the excitation across the lattice before relaxation. Although both share the same asymptotic decay rate, the two-step protocol relaxes significantly faster due to its reduced overlap with the slow boundary-localized Liouvillian mode. The effect disappears when $J_{\\rm R}=J_{\\rm L}$, i.e., when the skin effect vanishes. Our results reveal a clear connection between boundary-induced non-normality and protocol-dependent relaxation acceleration, suggesting new routes for controlling dissipation and transient dynamics in open quantum systems."}

Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed \"information lattice\" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium."}

In this work, we study optimal bounds for partial trace quantities in terms of the spectrum; equivalently, we determine the best bounds attainable over unitary orbits of matrices. We solve this question for Schur-convex functionals acting on a single partial trace in terms of eigenvalues for self-adjoint matrices and then we extend these results to singular values of general matrices. We subsequently extend the study to Schur-convex functionals that act on several partial traces simultaneously and present sufficient conditions for sharpness. In cases where closed-form maximizers cannot be identified, we present quadratic programs that yield new computable upper bounds for any Schur-convex functional. We additionally present examples demonstrating improvements over previously known bounds. Finally, we conclude with the study of optimal bounds for an $n$-qubit system and its subsystems of dimension $2$."}

LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to being essentially constant for the volume-law phase thereby, discover an intrinsic length scale $ξ_E$ that diverges at the critical measurement probability $p_c$. While classical percolation transition captures successful transport across a network, MIPT as characterized by LE can be interpreted as quantifying the amount of quantum teleportation between two given nodes in a quantum circuit. Building on this insight, we propose a two-ancilla protocol that provides an experimentally accessible readout of entanglement redistribution across the transition."}

Paradigmatic examples often appear as quasiparticle towers of states, such as the maximally ferromagnetic spin-1/2 states, also known as Dicke states. A distinguishing feature of quantum many-body scars is that they admit multiple local \"parent\" Hamiltonians for which they are exact eigenstates. In this work, we show that the locality of such parent Hamiltonians strongly constrains the relative placement of these states within the energy spectrum. In particular, we prove that if the full set of Dicke states are exact eigenstates of an extensive local Hamiltonian, then their energies must necessarily be equally spaced. Our proof builds on recent results concerning parent Hamiltonians of the $W$ state, together with general algebraic structures underlying such quasiparticle towers. We further demonstrate that this equal spacing property extends to local Hamiltonians defined on arbitrary bounded-degree graphs, including regular lattices in any spatial dimension and expander graphs. Hamiltonians with $k$-local interactions and a bounded number of interaction terms per site are also encompassed by our proof. On the same classes of graphs, we additionally establish equal spacing for towers constructed from multi-site quasiparticles on top of product states. For the towers considered here, an immediate corollary of the equal spacing property is that any state initialized entirely within the quantum many-body scar manifold exhibits completely frozen entanglement dynamics under any local Hamiltonian for which those scars are exact eigenstates. Overall, our results reveal a stringent interplay between locality and the structure of quantum many-body scars."}

Given that quantum phase spaces (QPSs) provide an alternative description of quantum systems, and thus of the group's representation, one may wonder how such harmonic analysis changes. In this work we show that for general compact Lie-group quantum resource theories (QRTs), the entire family of Stratonovich-Weyl quantum phase space representations-characterized by the Cahill-Glauber parameter $s$-has a clear resource-theoretic and signal-processing meaning. Specifically, changing $s$ implements a group Fourier filter that can be continuously tuned to favor low-dimensional irreps where free states have most of their support ($s=-1$), leave the spectrum unchanged ($s=0$), or highlight resourceful, high-dimensional irreps ($s=1$). As such, distinct QPSs constitute veritable group Fourier filters for resources. Moreover, we show that the norms of the QRT's free state Fourier components completely characterize all QPSs. Finally, we uncover an $s$-duality relating the phase space spectra of free states and typical (Haar-random) highly resourceful states through a shift in $s$. Overall, our results provide a new interpretation of QPSs and promote them to a signal-processing framework for diagnosing, filtering, and visualizing quantum resources."}

However, this paradigm may break down in complex systems, where quantum interference and memory effects render the particle propagation anomalous, often fostering localization. Here we report on the observation of such anomalous dynamics in a minimal setting: an ultracold mass-imbalanced mixture of two fermionic gases in three dimensions. We release light impurities into a gas of heavier atoms and follow their evolution across different collisional regimes. Under strong interspecies interactions, by lowering the temperature we unveil a crossover from normal diffusion to subdiffusion. Simultaneously, a localized fraction of the light gas emerges, displaying no discernible dynamics over hundreds of collisions. Our findings, incompatible with the conventional Fermi-liquid picture, are instead captured by a model of an atom propagating through a (quasi-)static disordered landscape of point-like scatterers. These results highlight the key role of quantum interference in our mixture, which emerges as a versatile platform for exploring disorder-free localization phenomena."}

While the model remains quadratic, we find that the growth of the Lanczos coefficients structurally depends strongly on the chosen coupling. Concretely, we find $(i)$ approximately constant, $(ii)$ exactly constant, $(iii)$ square root-like as well $(iv)$ linear growth in the same model. We further argue that in fact through suitably chosen couplings, essentially arbitrary Lanczos coefficients can be obtained in this model.

In this theoretical work, we explore how tunneling dynamics in a bosonic Josephson junction are modified when the system is placed in a rotating, non-inertial frame. We show that the tunneling dynamics of ultracold bosons in a two-dimensional double-well potential offer an alternative pathway for inferring the rotation frequency. Using the mean-field and many-body analyses, we demonstrate that rotation strongly modifies the tunneling time period as well as the momentum and angular momentum dynamics. When the rotation axis passes through the center of the double well, the observables show distinct dynamical responses with increasing rotation frequency, enabling the rotation frequency to be assessed from changes in the tunneling dynamics. When the potential is displaced from the rotation axis, the rotation induces asymmetric tunneling and partial self-trapping, allowing both the rotation frequency and the displacement to be inferred. We further show that for an off-centered double well, the tunneling dynamics exhibit a pronounced orientation dependence, enabling the orientation of the double well to be inferred from the observed dynamics. The many-body analysis further shows that the depletion dynamics are strongly influenced by rotation, providing an additional tool for assessing the rotation frequency. Finally, we study the effect of time-dependent rotation in which the double well is gradually set into motion in the laboratory frame and identify distinct dynamical signatures that depend sensitively on the switching time. Together, these results establish a comprehensive framework for inferring the rotation frequency, radial displacement, and orientation directly from the tunneling dynamics."}
