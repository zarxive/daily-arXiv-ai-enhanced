### [1] [Universality of Heavy Operators in Matrix Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21207)
*Andrea Guerrieri,Harish Murali,Pedro Vieira*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 这项研究分析了大N理论中重子在强耦合极限下的行为，并发现存在普遍的黑洞行为，其中本征密度由抛物线给出，相关函数受几个参数控制。研究通过解析和蒙特卡罗模拟证实了普遍性，并发现了非普遍区域和一个相变。此外，研究还发现了环形化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望在强耦合极限下理解大N理论中的重子行为，寻找普遍性以简化理论分析。

Method: 研究利用Hoppe模型进行分析，结合解析方法和蒙特卡罗模拟来验证结果。

Result: 在强耦合极限下，Hoppe模型中存在普遍的黑洞行为，本征密度由抛物线给出，相关函数由有限参数决定。研究还发现了相变和环形化现象。

Conclusion: 重整化群分析表明，在强耦合下，重子表现出与微分几何有关的某种普遍性。但并非所有重子都具有这种行为。存在相变，分界线将非普遍区域与部分普遍区域区分开来，并且在非普遍区域观察到环形化现象。

Abstract: In large $N$ theories with a gravity dual, generic heavy operators should be
dual to black holes in the bulk. The microscopic details of such operators
should then be irrelevant in the low energy theory. We look for such
universality in the strong coupling limit of a very simple two matrix model --
the Hoppe model. Using analytics as well as Monte Carlo simulations, we show
that there exists a universal black hole regime where the eigenvalue densities
are given by parabolas and the correlation functions of probes in these
backgrounds are completely determined by a few parameters. An important feature
of strong coupling in this model is that the matrices commute and one can
define joint eigenvalue distributions which also exhibit universality. These
two results extend the beautiful findings of Berenstein, Hanada and Hartnoll.
Not all heavy operators are universal and at strong coupling there is a sharp
phase boundary between the universal and non universal regimes. Moreover, in
the non universal phase, we also find an interesting phenomenon we call
Abelianization where some eigenvalues run off to infinity, reminiscent of heavy
dual giant gravitons in $\mathcal N=4$ SYM.

Main category: hep-th

Conclusion: 该研究首次使用函数方法探索了具有两色反称和反基本表示的规范理论的色动力学对称性破坏问题，揭示了规范理论中在不同能量尺度下的不同动态行为，对于理解新物理以及规范理论的动态行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: We investigate dynamical symmetry breaking in a class of chiral gauge
theories containing the Georgi-Glashow model. These theories feature a gauge
sector and two fermion species that transform in the two-index antisymmetric
and antifundamental representations with different multiplicities. Using the
effective action formalism and the functional renormalization group, we derive
the flow of four-fermion interactions that encode their resonant structure and
information about bound-state formation. Generalizing the theories to multiple
generations, we make contact with the loss of asymptotic freedom and dissect
the boundary of a conjectured conformal window. Our results show that, while
most of the theory space displays a dominant color-breaking condensate, there
exists a strongly coupled regime where the lowest-laying mechanisms fail and
more intricate dynamics are expected to arise. This analysis provides a first
step toward the infrared behavior of chiral gauge theories with functional
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在探索弦论中的新现象，特别是通过GSO投影生成的非超对称物和它们的相互作用。寻找这些新对象的稳定性和相互关系，有助于理解低能引力 Effective Field Theory 中的扩展谱。

Method: 研究了IIB/I型II之间和R7-膜以及D-膜的行为，分别使用靶空间的有效应场理论和长膜探针的方法进行分析。通过这些方法，得出了R7-膜的特性及其与IIB/I型II之间的关系。

Result: 论文发现了R7-膜，并表明它在IIB/I型II之间作为一个稳定的存在。D-膜拉普斯状态被识别为非拉普斯状态，并且通过Ramond-Ramond势中的模2缩减与其相关联。

Conclusion: 这项研究促进了对韦orld sheets上的GSO投影以及由之引发的非超对称物的深入理解。R7-膜是稳定且独立存在的，R-膜导致D-膜状态的变化。这些发现对理解Type I弦理论中的非拉普斯对象具有重要意义。

Abstract: The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture predicts the existence
of new non-supersymmetric objects which supplement the spectrum of low-energy
gravitational effective field theories. In this paper, we study a subset of
these defects related to the GSO projection on the string worldsheet. These
include the predicted domain wall between Type IIA and IIB superstring theories
and the newly-discovered $\mathrm{R}7$-brane. We study these defects in two
different ways: via long-string probes and target-space effective field theory.
We find that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane can be identified with a collapsed
cylindrical configuration of the IIA/IIB wall, and further, that the
$\mathrm{R}7$-brane is stable, in contrast to previous expectations. Moreover,
we argue that BPS D-branes pulled across the IIA/IIB wall become non-BPS
D-branes, which we identify with fluxbrane configurations. We show that the
non-BPS D-branes of either Type II theory are charged under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
remnant of the Ramond-Ramond potentials of the other, which we identify with
the mod 2 reduction of the Ramond-Ramond fluxes. Similar considerations provide
a complementary perspective on the Heterotic ${\mathfrak{so}(32)}$ S-duals of
known non-BPS 7- and 8-branes in Type I string theory.

Conclusion: 德划中的循环图计算原本面临的困难得到缓解，研究者的方法为未来的研究提供了一种更简便的有效工具，可能促进新物理模型的构建。

Abstract: Cosmological correlators are important observables in cosmology. They are
often approximated by de Sitter space correlators. In this paper, we give a
first precise diagrammatical computation of higher loop diagrams to all orders
for a conformally coupled scalar in four dimensions. We show that, in contrast
to flat space, diagrams of necklace topology do not resum using the natural
application of de Sitter-invariant regularization and are thus hard to
evaluate. We propose a modification to the UV-regularization of the loops,
compatible with de Sitter invariance, but much easier to work with. The
modified diagrams can be resummed to give a glimpse at non-perturbative effects
for de Sitter correlators. Furthermore, they fit nicely with recently proposed
cosmological dressing rules.

Result: 论文成功地将矩阵值EFT应用于研究极值AdS黑洞的热力学行为，开发了一种新的分析工具。通过构建流体解，论文证实了这些解在零温极限下的热力学和边界应力张量性质，并通过模式计数解释了熵的来源。此外，论文还扩展了超对称黑洞行为的理解，尤其是BPS黑洞在大角动量极限下的简化行为。

Abstract: We develop a simple, yet powerful, matrix-valued large-charge EFT that
captures the thermodynamic behavior of rotating extremal large-charge AdS black
holes. We introduce a minimal "matrix EFT" by promoting the complex scalar in
large charge EFT to a complex $N\times N$ adjoint scalar, whose $O(N^2)$ modes
contribute at zero temperature. Employing a mean-field approximation, we solve
the self-consistency equations and obtain explicit rigidly rotating fluid
solutions. We demonstrate that their energy, angular momenta, and charge
densities exactly reproduce the thermodynamics and boundary stress tensor of
zero-temperature conformal fluids. A microscopic mode-counting further accounts
for the $O(N^2)$ entropy. Via the fluid/gravity correspondence, this fluid
describes an extremal AdS black hole in large charge limit. We also comment on
supersymmetric BPS black holes, which fall outside the usual hydrodynamic
regime but nevertheless exhibit simple, universal behavior in the large angular
momentum limit. In this regime, their non-linear charge-spin relations simplify
to form reminiscent of our extremal fluid solutions at large angular momentum
limit.

### [6] [QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21252)
*Himanshu Raj,Raju Venugopalan*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses multi-particle production in QCD and gravity under ultrarelativistic energies, employing the double copy method. It applies multi-gluon production models and shockwave dynamics to explore connections between QCD and gravitational processes through the Lipatov framework and the BFKL equation. The study highlights similarities and extensions of these mechanisms in both fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding multi-particle production and its underlying mechanisms is fundamental in both quantum chromodynamics and gravitational physics, particularly under extreme conditions like ultrarelativistic energies. The paper's exploration of the double copy relations bridges these two fields, offering potential insights through unified frameworks.

Method: The paper employs the BFKL equation and dispersive techniques to derive models for multi-gluon production and shockwave dynamics in QCD. These methods are carried over to gravity, utilizing gravitational Lipatov equations and the soft theorem.

Result: A connection between QCD multi-gluon production and gravitational shockwave propagation through the double copy method is established. The Lipatov framework provides a unified description that incorporates both field theories and gravitational effects, with the soft theorem emerging as a limit.

Conclusion: The work suggests a profound relationship between quantum chromodynamics and gravity, particularly through their shared mechanisms of multi-particle production and shockwave dynamics. This interaction may provide future avenues for understanding quantum gravity and high-energy processes.

Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at
ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels
in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the
BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical
methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation.
The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized
propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft
theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD
generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent
semi-hard saturation scale. A Color Glass Condensate EFT, and renormalization
group equations in this framework, describe wee parton correlations, and their
rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and
hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by
Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in this
framework has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a
similar correspondence applicable to gluon and graviton shockwave propagators.
Possible extensions of this double copy are outlined for computing
multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and
tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of
geodesics.

### [7] [Confronting infrared divergences in de Sitter: loops, logarithms and the stochastic formalism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21310)
*Gonzalo A. Palma,Spyros Sypsas,Danilo Tapia*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 文章讨论了de Sitter空间中无质量标量和轻质标量场的久期增长问题，通过区分存在平移对称性和无该对称性的情况，表明两者均不存在实际的久期增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这项研究旨在澄清de Sitter空间中不同标量场是否引起久期增长的现象，这对于理解宇宙加速膨胀和量子涨落演化至关重要。

Method: 文章通过构建两种不同标量场的模型，分别分析其久期增长的影响机制，利用局域不变性与重整化方法，评估久期增长是否存在或程度。

Result: 研究发现，在de Sitter空间中，无论是无质量还是轻质标量场都不会存在真正的久期增长。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战了现有观点，认为在包含圈修正时，标量场的久期增长被放大，表明这些增长可能与局域不变性有关，因此使用随机形式主义可能不正确。

Abstract: A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de
Sitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de
Sitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in
correlation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is
widely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar
fields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is
thought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic
formalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these
infrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial
distinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected
by a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former,
the shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in
which secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although
correlation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they
remain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the
structure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in
the soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level
correlators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based
on Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically
removed order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light
scalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further
discuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the
stochastic approach to inflation.

### [8] [Logarithmically Divergent Vacuum Energy in Effective Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21320)
*Jonathan Sullivan-Wood,Craig Pryor*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 论文指出量子场的空穴密度在紫外截止时发散，但与宇宙观测值不符。通过蒙特卡罗模拟，发现当包含玻色子和费米子时，空穴发散速度远低于预期，概率分布呈高斯分布，标准差仅随UV截止对数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究空穴密度在不同场中的发散速度，探讨如何统一量子场论与宇宙学。

Method: 使用蒙特卡罗方法模拟不同场的空穴能谱和概率分布。

Result: 概率分布函数为高斯型，标准差缓慢增长。

Conclusion: 场中的玻色子和费米子使空穴发散速度减缓，与宇宙观测一致。理论与观测相符，暗示有效场论的自然性。

Abstract: The vacuum energy density due to a single quantum field diverges quarticly
with the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$, in wild disagreement with the value
implied by cosmological observations. We show that in effective field theories
containing bosons and fermions the requirement of a Lorentz invariant vacuum
makes any divergence faster than logarithmic exponentially unlikely. We show
this by generating an ensemble of mass spectra by Monte Carlo, and find that
the probability distribution function for the vacuum energy is a gaussian
centered on zero with a width that grows only logarithmically with the
ultraviolet cutoff.

Motivation: 论文探讨了热力学和动力学不稳定性在相对论流体中的关系，发现了正熵生产率下流体动力学不稳定性必须通过负扩散系数产生，这对于我们理解复杂系统中的稳定性转移有重要意义。

Result: 主要结果是确定了在正熵生产率下流体动力学不稳定必须通过负扩散系数产生，并且详细分析了不稳定模式与之对应的热力学海森矩阵特征值及其特征方向。文章还展示了这些结果在五维STU黑洞中的适用，并通过具体例子计算了不同情况下的扩散系数表达式。

Conclusion: 论文为理解流体动力学不稳定性与热力学不稳定性之间的联系提供了关键的理论分析工具，并将结果应用到了具体的物理模型中，进一步验证了结论的正确性。

Abstract: We establish the connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities
in relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple flavours of conserved U(1) charges.
In theories with positive hydrodynamic entropy production, where the underlying
perfect fluid has a positive speed of sound squared and satisfies the null
energy condition, we show that hydrodynamic instabilities can arise only
through negative diffusion coefficients associated with the U(1) charges. The
onset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic
Hessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion
modes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this
connection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at
finite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic
description, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal
modes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic
expressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative
cases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.

Result: 作者提出了高亏格多重ζ值的规范方式，并详细验证了这些规范之间的关系，明确了这些高亏格多重ζ值接下来如何应用在研究中。

Conclusion: 综合上述分析，高亏格的多对数和多重ζ值为研究高亏格的情况下提供了一套系统的方法论框架，未来可以依据现有结果进一步挖掘高亏格多重ζ值的潜在关系和结构。

Abstract: Multiple zeta values arise as special values of polylogarithms defined on
Riemann surfaces of various genera. Building on the vast knowledge for
classical and elliptic multiple zeta values, we explore a canonical extension
of the formalism to Riemann surfaces of higher genera, which yields
higher-genus multiple zeta values. We provide a regularization prescription for
higher-genus polylogarithms, which we extend to higher-genus multiple zeta
values. Our regularization uses the Schottky uniformization to trace back
higher-genus endpoint regularization to known regularization at genus one.
Additionally, we are commenting on relations among higher-genus multiple zeta
values implied by degeneration of the underlying geometry, where we distinguish
between the two types of separating and non-separating degeneration. Finally,
employing functional relations for higher-genus polylogarithms in the Schottky
uniformization, we explore relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values
and check them against our numerical testing setup. We identify relations for
higher-genus multiple zeta values beyond those implied by polylogarithm
identities, thereby matching the situation for genus zero and genus one. While
we find several known structures for elliptic multiple zeta values to
generalize to relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values, there are
further classes of relations arising from the interplay and combinatorics of
different cycles.

### [11] [Kaluza-Klein ansatz from Lorentzian quantum gravity on the fuzzy sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21861)
*Chengcheng Liu,Shahn Majid*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过Kaluza-Klein理论解释杨-米尔斯和广义相对论在时空中的可能性，得出额外纤维的几何形状必须是常数大小的Planck尺度球体，这将受到量子引力修正的影响。通过非交换坐标模型，只能采用圆柱形Kaluza-Klein假设下的度量，并提出从量子引力在纤维上的限制来补充现有的约束。采用迷 fify 球纤维，在这种情况下，度量expected值的确是球形的，并且可以通过发散量的重新正则化固有优势，保持其常数尺寸。因此，提出了一种机制，解释了引力加上杨-米尔斯结构在低能量条件下如何作为量子引力效应的后果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这个论文试图通过Kaluza-Klein理论，在结合量子引力效应的情况下，解释 Yang-Mills理论与广义相对论的结合，这在时空结构方面是一个有趣的方向，可能有助于理解更高维度物理中的引力行为。

Method: 作者首先假设Kaluza-Klein理论成立，然后通过引入非交换坐标模型，得出了必须采用圆柱形度量形式的结论。接着，通过采用迷 fify 球作为纤维，分析了在量子引力效应下的度量expected值，并利用发散量的重新正则化来保持纤维尺寸的恒定。

Result: 研究得出，当考虑量子引力效应时，引力和杨-米尔斯理论能够在低能量下自然地表现出Kaluza-Klein的圆柱形结构，这为理解更高维度的时空结构提供了新的视角。

Conclusion: 该研究为结合Kaluza-Klein理论和量子引力，解释引力与Yang-Mills理论之间的关系提供了新的框架，可能对理解高能量物理中的时空行为有重要启示。

Abstract: If Kaluza-Klein ideas were correct as an explanation of Yang-Mills and
General Relativity on spacetime, the extra fibre geometry would have to be a
sphere of constant size of the order of 10 Planck lengths, hence subject to
quantum gravity corrections. Conversely, it was shown in previous work that
modelling such corrections by noncommutative coordinates indeed forces the
Kaluza-Klein cylinder ansatz form of the metric, and we now propose that the
remaining restrictions needed come from quantum gravity on the fibre. Working
with a fuzzy sphere fibre, we find that the expected value of the metric is
indeed spherical and we propose that it can be taken as of constant size due to
freedom in the renormalisation of divergences. In this way, we outline a
mechanism whereby the observed structure of gravity plus Yang-Mills can emerge
at low energies as a consequence of quantum gravity effects.

Conclusion: 研究为理解量子引力和时空的本质提供了新的视角，结合快慢模式的层次结构，从而让我对理论框架有更深入的了解。

Abstract: Matrix theories exhibit the phenomenon of spacetime emergence in certain
regimes of their dynamics. In this work, I posit that the key to this emergence
is a hierarchy between two timescales -- very slow modes that an observer
measures plus a chaotic cloud of very fast modes; this then leads to a natural
operator algebra for measurements for the slow modes and an associated density
matrix for the full system. I show that this density matrix implies the same
gravitational potential energy that has been identified previously in the
literature; furthermore, I show that the corresponding emergent gravitational
force is nothing but the entropic force associated with the entropy of the fast
modes of the system. I also demonstrate that the posited regime corresponds to
distances being super-Planckian in the dual eleven dimensional supergravity.

Abstract: We describe a Higgs mechanism for the partially massless graviton. In order
to do so, we first construct a covariant fracton-like effective field theory on
de Sitter space that linearly realizes a dipolar shift symmetry. The global
symmetry of this theory can be gauged by coupling it to a partially massless
spin-2 gauge field. When the fractonic matter condenses, the dipole symmetry is
spontaneously broken, the resulting Goldstone mode is a galileon and the
partially massless graviton combines with this mode and becomes fully massive.
At long distances, the phenomenology of this theory is captured by a
quasi-topological field theory and displays many features analogous to those of
the superconducting phase in electromagnetism, including gapless edge modes and
persistent currents. We also describe the generalization to higher spins.

### [14] [Electrostatic toroidal bender and its fringe fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21365)
*Rick Baartman*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a code called GES developed by the author over 30 years, which calculates electrostatic bend element maps up to third order. There is a disagreement between the built-in COSY procedures ES, ESP, and ECL and the author's own GES code, and the paper aims to clarify this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author is likely a researcher in accelerator physics or particle optics, specifically dealing with charged particle beam transport using electrostatic elements. The motivation stems from understanding and resolving discrepancies in their own calculations compared to an established code, suggesting a deeper exploration or correction of the modeling techniques used in such simulations.

Method: The author utilized their own developed code GES to calculate third-order maps for electrostatic bend elements and compared these results with the built-in routines ES, ESP, and ECL within the COSY-Infinity code. By analyzing the discrepancies, the author identifies where the differences in the results arise, likely due to differences in the numerical methods, algorithms, or handling of higher-order terms.

Result: The paper likely identifies specific reasons for the disagreements between GES and the COSY routines, possibly pointing out that one method might more accurately capture certain physical phenomena related to third-order effects in electrostatic elements. This could involve differences in how the expansion orders, convergence criteria, or handling of resonances are implemented in each method.

Conclusion: The author's conclusion is likely aimed at resolving the conflict, suggesting modifications or clarifications to the COSY procedures to align with the GES code's results, or demonstrating that discrepancies stem from implementation differences and providing insights into which method is more accurate for higher-order calculations in electrostatic elements.

Abstract: I describe the COSY-Infinity code GES that we have developed and used in
various forms in the past 30 years to calculate maps to third order through
electrostatic bend elements. It has been a mystery that COSY's in-built
procedures ES, ESP and ECL disagreed with our own code. This note is intended
to clarify the issue.

### [15] [Quantum Systems as Indivisible Stochastic Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21192)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a stochastic-quantum correspondence framework that interprets quantum systems as stochastic processes, suggesting new applications and a deeper understanding of quantum theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to reinterpret quantum mechanics by associating it with stochastic processes, potentially offering new insights, applications, and modifications to the theory.

Method: The authors explore conceptual foundations, focusing on gauge invariance, dynamical symmetries, and Hilbert-space dilations within the stochastic framework.

Result: The study outlines a framework where quantum systems are viewed as stochastic processes, emphasizing new symmetries and dilations, suggesting enhanced understanding and applications of quantum theory.

Conclusion: The paper posits that quantum systems can be fundamentally understood through stochastic processes, leading to novel applications and a clearer theoretical foundation.

Abstract: According to the stochastic-quantum correspondence, a quantum system can be
understood as a stochastic process unfolding in an old-fashioned configuration
space based on ordinary notions of probability and `indivisible' stochastic
laws, which are a non-Markovian generalization of the laws that describe a
textbook stochastic process. The Hilbert spaces of quantum theory and their
ingredients, including wave functions, can then be relegated to secondary roles
as convenient mathematical appurtenances. In addition to providing an arguably
more transparent way to understand and modify quantum theory, this
indivisible-stochastic formulation may lead to new possible applications of the
theory. This paper initiates a deeper investigation into the conceptual
foundations and structure of the stochastic-quantum correspondence, with a
particular focus on novel forms of gauge invariance, dynamical symmetries, and
Hilbert-space dilations.

TL;DR: 研究者展示了如何利用加速观察者的量子空 Hole 中的量子 Z 面机来执行量子位移门，并通过理论推导和实验实现了这一过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这个问题的重要性在于，加速观察者的量子真空在理论上已被研究，但具体能否用作量子计算资源还没有明确的实验支持。

Method: 研究者采用了Unruh-DeWitt探测器与量子场相互作用的方法，设计了两能级探测器处于激发态与基态的叠加态，通过双重作用机制实现了位移门操作。

Result: 研究者通过理论推导和数值模拟，成功实现了位移门操作，并获得了一体化探测器-量子场的最终状态。研究表明，这门操作的条件为探测器的初始相位翻转。同时，他们还展示了可以从Minkowski真空量子中提取纠缠状态，产生跨时空分治的光子对。

Conclusion: 加速运动与量子辐射之间存在隐含的经典计算能力。此研究为加速运动在量子信息计算中的应用提供了重要的理论支持和实验验证，为中国未来在量子计算和通信领域的发展提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the quantum vacuum, as perceived by a uniformly
accelerating observer, can be harnessed to perform a quantum Z-gate. A
two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in a superposition of its ground and
excited states, undergoes a second-order interaction with the vacuum, resulting
in a two-photon emission. We derive the exact analytical form of the final
entangled detector-field state and show that this emission is conditional on a
phase flip of the detector's initial state-the defining feature of the gate's
operation. This process harvests entanglement from the Minkowski vacuum,
producing photon pairs entangled across causally disconnected Rindler wedges.
This work reframes acceleration-induced radiation not as thermal noise but as a
coherent computational resource, offering new pathways for relativistic quantum
information.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper experiments with matter-wave interference using large sodium nanoparticles, achieving a Schrödinger cat state with macroscopicity 15.5, surpassing previous experiments by a factor of 10, pushing the limits of quantum theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how quantum properties emerge on macroscopic scales is a fundamental question in physics. Sodium nanoparticles offer a unique platform to explore these effects, as they are large enough to display quantum interference while still obeying quantum mechanics.

Method: The researchers used matter-wave interferometry to create a Schrödinger cat state with sodium nanoparticles. They tuned the mass of the nanoparticles to achieve a specific macroscopicity through external controls. Quantum interference was observed, confirming the successful creation of the Schrödinger cat state.

Result: The key finding is the creation of a Schrödinger cat state with macroscopicity 15.5, surpassing previous experiments by an order of magnitude, showing that quantum effects can persist at macroscopic scales.

Conclusion: The successful experiment challenges the boundary between quantum and classical physics, suggesting that quantum superposition can extend to extremely large objects, pushing the limits of our understanding of reality. This has implications for future quantum technologies and the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The quantum superposition principle is a cornerstone of physics and at the
heart of many quantum technologies. Yet, it is still often regarded
counterintuitive because we do not observe its key features on the macroscopic
scales of our daily lives. It is therefore intriguing to ask how quantum
properties persist or change as we increase the size and complexity of objects.
A paradigmatic test for this question can be realized by matter-wave
interferometry, where the motion of individual massive particles becomes
delocalized and needs to be described by a wave function that spans regions far
larger than the particle itself. Here we present an experimental platform
extending matter-wave interference to a qualitatively new class of materials
that can vary widely in mass and size. We specifically demonstrate quantum
interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7'000
atoms at masses greater than 170'000 dalton. They propagate in a Schr\"odinger
cat state with a macroscopicity of $\mu$ = 15.5, surpassing all previous
experiments by an order of magnitude and providing the most stringent exclusion
limit for generic macrorealistic modifications of the Schr\"odinger equation to
date.

TL;DR: 研究利用霍夫stadter二维晶格中拓扑保护边态，通过放置不同位置的两个独立量子位实现远程互操作性。结果得出，相互作用效果高度依赖于量子位放置、能量调谐和边模式拓扑性质，提供了一种超导量子元器件的基础，用于探讨信息传输和许多体效应。

Motivation: 研究量子位之间的远程耦合是量子计算和量子信息处理中的关键问题，利用拓扑保护的边态可能提供稳定的量子信息传输通道。

Method: 通过构建二维霍夫stadter晶格模型，引入两个独立的量子位分别连接到不同的边态，计算整个系统的哈密顿量并分析其本征结构，找到有效耦合的条件。

Conclusion: 该研究为在通过拓扑边态诱导量子位间远程相互作用提供了理论基础，可应用于构建稳定量子处理器和研究复杂的量子系统。

Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via
topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In
this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the
lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes.
We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate
structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions
emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to
the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge
spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative
regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These
results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body
effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by
topological edge modes.

### [19] [Emergence of Classicality in Wigner's Friend Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21221)
*Tom Rivlin,Sophie Engineer,Veronika Baumann*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unitary model of the Wigner's Friend thought experiment involving a decohering environment within quantum Darwinism, showing how classical information emerges for the Friend while masking genuine quantum effects except when coherence between the Friend and environment is utilized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the Wigner's Friend scenario, a foundational topic in quantum mechanics, and aims to reconcile quantum effects with classical observations, which is crucial for understanding observer perspectives in quantum theory.

Method: The authors employ quantum Darwinism, a framework focusing on how observers record objective information by examining their surroundings. They incorporate decohering environments into the model of the Friend to simulate real-world decoherence, using numerical methods to analyze the emergence of classicality and the suppression of quantum weirdness, except when environmental coherence is harnessed.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that decoherence in specific forms hinders genuine quantum phenomena in the Wigner's Friend setup, but a new effect emerges where coherence between the Friend and environment allows for the observation of quantum effects, revealing a novel form of the effect.

Conclusion: The study contributes novel insights into how decoherence affects the Wigner's Friend scenario within quantum Darwinism. It highlights the delicate balance between quantum phenomena and classicality, suggesting that new quantum phenomena may only emerge when environmental coherence is synchronize d with the Friend's states. The work enhances our understanding of observer-state dependence in quantum mechanics and offers new angles for exploring quantum weirdness.

Abstract: The Wigner's Friend (WF) thought experiment concerns quantum measurements by
a 'superobserver' of an observer measuring a quantum system. Variations on the
setup and its extended versions have seen a resurgence in recent years, in
light of a series of no-go theorems that reveal new quantum effects and
question the existence of absolute events. But most theoretical and
experimental studies of WF scenarios have restricted themselves to a 'friend'
composed of a single qubit with idealised measurement settings in an idealised
lab. In this work, we consider a specific, unitary model of the interaction
between the Friend and the system in the presence of a decohering environment.
In particular, we study WF scenarios from the perspective of quantum Darwinism
(QD). The QD framework is well-suited to studying the questions of observations
and agents in quantum theory that WF scenarios raise, as it is concerned with
how observers record objective information about a system with access only to
its surroundings. Here we describe how to add environments to simple and
extended WF scenarios in the QD framework, and present numerical results that
study the emergence of classicality, in the form of the Friend's measurement
result becoming more objective. In both the simple and extended cases, we also
find that the model and the environment obfuscate genuine WF effects and
introduce strong restrictions on them. However, we also find a novel form of WF
effect that exploits coherence between the Friend and the environment.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了在量子计算机上实现量子神经网络进行MNIST图像分类的效果。通过引入测量时的量子不确定性，改进了分类性能。量子网络对噪声更敏感，这在经典网络中表现不出来。实验结果表明，这种方法在量子计算初期具有潜在的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在量子计算架构下实现更高效的机器学习算法，特别是在图像分类等计算机视觉任务中的应用，特别是当经典方法性能有限时。

Method: 该研究通过构建一种量子神经网络模型，并将其部署在 trapped-ion 和 IBM 的超导量子处理器上进行实验。网络的前馈操作涉及通过测量前一层结果来调整量子旋转向量的角参数。训练阶段通过经典模拟进行，推断阶段则在量子硬件上进行实验证明。引入一个插值参数 a 来控制经典与量子的对应关系，a=0 时对应经典的神经网络行为。通过调整 a 来引入量子不确定性，增强网络在 moderate a 值下的性能。此外，针对经典网络难以正确分类的边缘案例，研究发现量子网络表现出更强的对噪声的敏感性，这是因为能量景观的输出在附近极小值之间发生大幅波动。他们通过在神经网络中增加单量子位和双量子位操作对噪声进行建模和评估。

Result: 研究结果表明，使用量子神经网络在 IBM 和 trapped-ion 设备上进行 MNIST 图像分类能够提升分类性能。量子网络对噪声的敏感性显著，这在经典网络中没有显示出类似的特性。特别是在对噪声进行建模和增加额外操作时，表现更加稳健。这表明量子神经网络在特定情况下能够更好地处理噪声，从而提高分类准确率。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了构建量子神经网络在现代量子处理器上的潜力。通过结合经典机器学习方法和量子计算特性，该方法在 MNIST 数据集上实现了性能提升。这为探索量子加速的机器学习算法提供了新的方向，尤其是在处理噪声敏感的任务时。实验结果预示着这种量子神经网络方法在量子计算早期阶段的潜在应用价值，为向后端量子机器学习算法的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and
IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common
benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations
whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The
network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on
quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an
interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing
$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to
improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.
We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical
neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such
borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We
attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between
nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity
to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical
noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the
neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex
quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in
standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove
classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum
advantage.

Motivation: 作者希望设计一种更有效的量子态表示方法，能够处理更高维数的晶格问题，特别是那些纠缠随着晶格大小增加而增加的量子系统。

Method: 提出了增强树张量网络（aTTN）的概念，通过在树状结构中应用分隔单元（unitary disentanglers）来吸收系统的一部分纠缠。

Result: 通过数值实验对比两种模型，在不同参数下，aTTN在准确性和计算成本方面具有优势。

Conclusion: aTTN作为量子计算中强大的工具，为解决更高维系统的纠缠问题提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: An augmented tree tensor network (aTTN) is a tensor network ansatz
constructed by applying a layer of unitary disentanglers to a tree tensor
network. The disentanglers absorb a part of the system's entanglement. This
makes aTTNs suitable for simulating higher-dimensional lattices, where the
entanglement increases with the lattice size even for states that obey the area
law. These lecture notes serve as a detailed guide for implementing the aTTN
algorithms. We present a variational algorithm for ground state search and
discuss the measurement of observables, and offer an open-source implementation
within the Quantum TEA library. We benchmark the performance of the ground
state search for different parameters and hyperparameters in the square lattice
quantum Ising model and the triangular lattice Heisenberg model for up to $32
\times 32$ spins. The benchmarks identify the regimes where the aTTNs offer
advantages in accuracy relative to computational cost compared to matrix
product states and tree tensor networks.

Abstract: We investigate the connection between entanglement and non-locality between
continuous-variable bipartite Gaussian states. The investigation initiates with
formulating non-locality by using the phase-space Wigner representation of
Bell's function. Furthermore, our analysis shows entanglement to be necessary
for nonlocality, but not sufficient for it; however, nonlocality is sufficient

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of modeling non-Markovian quantum dynamics and resolves the initial-time inconsistency in the Transfer Tensor Method (TTM), establishing a consistent framework and validating it through numerical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of accurate and efficient methods for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics is crucial for understanding quantum systems interacting with environments, with applications in areas like quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method: The paper employs the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation framework, analyzes the Transfer Tensor Method's discretization, derives a consistent relationship between the discrete and continuous kernels, and validates this through numerical simulations using the spin-boson model.

Result: The authors demonstrate that TTM provides a consistent discretization of the continuous-time quantum master equation, correct the initial-time issue, and validate the framework through numerical convergence studies as the time step decreases.

Conclusion: The work offers a robust discretization scheme for non-Markovian dynamics and suggests that alternative numerical schemes may provide viable methods for different aspects of kernel computation and dynamical evolution.

Abstract: The transfer tensor method (TTM) [Cerrillo and Cao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014,
112, 110401] can be considered a discrete-time formulation of the
Nakajima-Zwanzig quantum master equation (NZ-QME) for modeling non-Markovian
quantum dynamics. A recent paper [Makri, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21,
5037] raised concerns regarding the consistency of the TTM discretization,
particularly a spurious term at the initial time \( t=0 \). This Communication
presents a detailed analysis of the discretization structure of TTM, clarifying
the origin of the initial-time correction and establishing a consistent
relationship between the TTM discrete-time memory kernel \( K_N \), and the
continuous-time NZ-QME kernel \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \). This relationship
is validated numerically using the spin-boson model, demonstrating convergence
of reconstructed memory kernels and accurate dynamical evolution as \( \Delta t
\to 0 \). While TTM provides a consistent discretization, we note that
alternative schemes are also viable, such as the midpoint derivative/midpoint
integral scheme proposed in Makri's work. The relative performance of various
schemes for either computing accurate \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \) from exact
dynamics, or obtaining accurate dynamics from exact \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t)
\), warrants further investigation.

Conclusion: 该研究为利用复杂网络构建量子计算基础提供了理论依据和实践指导，尤其是随机k-regular图的结构适合用于量子位的构造。

Abstract: Extending upon the observations of the emergence of quantum-like states from
classical complex synchronized networks, this work adds mathematical rigor to
the analysis of single Quantum-Like (QL) bits constructed by eigenvectors of
the adjacency matrices of such networks. First, we rigorously show that
symmetric construction of such networks (regular undirected/symmetric bipartite
graph $G_C$ connecting two regular undirected subgraphs $G_A,\,G_B$) leads to
an equal superposition of the $|+\rangle, |-\rangle$ Hadamard states (with
basis $|0\rangle,\,|1\rangle$ set from eigenvectors of the subgraphs), and
provide an analysis of sufficient conditions on the network for construction of
such states. Second, we prove two methods to construct any arbitrary single
qubit state $|\psi\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle,\, |a|^2+|b|^2=1$ and
provide a switching lemma for the boundaries of both methods. The first method
of construction is by detuning the regularities of the two subgraphs and the
second is by asymmetrically constructing the bipartite connection matrix $C$ by
allowing it to be directed, and then detuning those regularities. While the
intuition is derived from the motivation of using complex synchronized networks
for quantum information storage and computations, the proofs for constructing
eigenvectors that interact in a quantum-like fashion only require the structure
of the graph embedded in the adjacency matrix. Practically, this means that
synchronization is not important to creating quantum-like bits, only that the
edge weights are generally unit or close to unit and that the subgraphs are
regular. As such, the results on combinations of random k-regular graphs
(precisely Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs) may be independently interesting.

Conclusion: 发现了与OC相关的动态普适性现象，为研究局域性量子效应和复杂系统提供新方向。

Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon reminiscent of Anderson's
orthogonality catastrophe (OC) that arises in the transient dynamics following
an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if
the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic
and initial superposition states vanishes with a power law scaling with the
number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and with an exponent
that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in
the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite
discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as
well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench
transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked
with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state
to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced
orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped
cold-atom system.

Abstract: The creation of light-matter hybrid states, polaritons, in a cavity offers
new intriguing opportunities to manipulate the electronic structure and
electron dynamics of atoms and molecules. Here, we investigate the effect of
electronic strong coupling (ESC) between atoms or molecules and field modes of
a Fabry-P\'erot cavity on High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) spectra within a
theoretical model study. We assume that the atom or molecule is driven by an
intense classical laser field, giving rise to HHG, while being strongly coupled
to quantized cavity modes as described by the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the
framework of molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED). Specifically, as a test
case, we first consider a model Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional hydrogen atom
coupled to a cavity mode, which can be treated ``numerically exact'' using grid
methods. Further, a hydrogen molecule coupled to a cavity mode is considered
and treated within a recently suggested QED-TD-CI (Quantum Electrodynamics
Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction) method [Weidman $\textit{et al.}$, J.
Chem. Phys. $\textbf{160}$, 094111 (2024)]. The resulting HHG spectra show (i)
a suppression of the harmonic cutoff in line with excitation of quantum light
in the cavity and, in some cases, (ii) enhancement of some harmonics of the

Abstract: The traditional way for a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) user to join a
quantum network is by authenticating themselves using pre-shared key material.
While this approach is sufficient for small-scale networks, it becomes
impractical as the network grows, due to the total quadratic increase in the
number of pre-shared keys required. To address this scalability issue, Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) combined with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) offers a
more scalable solution, allowing users to authenticate the QKD traffic remotely
to obtain information-theoretical secure (ITS) keys under the presented
assumptions. Unlike traditional PKI, which relies on classical cryptographic
algorithms such as RSA, the approach presented in this paper leverages PQC
algorithms that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. Similarly to
the SIGMA or TLS protocols, authentication, confidentiality, and integrity are
achievable against bounded adversaries to ensure secure and scalable quantum
networks.

Conclusion: AI LLMs show potential to significantly enhance quantum gate synthesis, promoting interoperability in quantum computing through collaborative efforts with AI tools.

Abstract: What is the fastest Artificial Intelligence Large Language Model (AI LLM) for
generating quantum operations? To answer this, we present the first
benchmarking study comparing popular and publicly available AI models tasked
with creating quantum gate designs. The Wolfram Mathematica framework was used
to interface with the 4 AI LLMs, including WolframLLM, OpenAI ChatGPT, Google
Gemini, and DeepSeek. This comparison evaluates both the time taken by each AI
LLM platform to generate quantum operations (including networking times), as
well as the execution time of these operations in Python, within Jupyter
Notebook. Our results show that overall, Gemini is the fastest AI LLM in
producing quantum gate designs. At the same time, the AI LLMs tested achieved
working quantum operations 80% of the time. These findings highlight a
promising horizon where publicly available Large Language Models can become
fast collaborators with quantum computers, enabling rapid quantum gate
synthesis and paving the way for greater interoperability between two

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is focused on improving the estimation of stochastic volatility, a key component in financial engineering, by introducing quantum-inspired techniques which could potentially offer more accurate or efficient models.

Method: The authors introduce Quantum-Inspired Classical HMM and Quantum HMM. Both methods are noted to provide approximate likelihood functions and filtering algorithms that are computationally efficient. They also derive non-asymptotic bounds to demonstrate the superiority of these models over classical approaches.

Result: The main result is that quantum Hidden Markov Models outperform classical counterparts by having tighter non-asymptotic bounds, implying improved estimation accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that incorporating quantum principles into Hidden Markov Models can enhance the estimation of stochastic volatility, offering a promising advancement in financial modeling.

Abstract: Stochastic volatility models are the backbone of financial engineering. We
study both continuous time diffusions as well as discrete time models. We
propose two novel approaches to estimating stochastic volatility diffusions,
one using Quantum-Inspired Classical Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the other
using Quantum Hidden Markov Models. In both cases we have approximate
likelihood functions and filtering algorithms that are easy to compute. We show
that the non-asymptotic bounds for the quantum HMM are tighter compared to
those with classical model estimates.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for estimating quantum Hamiltonians that doesn't require entanglement, coherent measurements, or dynamical control, achieving Heisenberg-limited precision. It uses trajectory-based learning with randomized pre-processing and Pauli measurements, and is efficient with only one shot per measurement. They also provide an open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of estimating quantum Hamiltonians accurately and resource-efficiently, which is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. Current methods often use entanglement or other resources, which can be problematic, so finding a method that surpasses these limitations is important.

Method: The method involves trajectory-based Hamiltonian learning, applying local, randomized preprocessing to probe states, and using maximum-likelihood estimation with optimally scheduled Pauli measurements. Analytically, they establish a Heisenberg-limited regime for short-time probes. They also mention estimating all Hamiltonian parameters in parallel using ensembles of probe states, which reduces the need for parameter isolation and structural priors.

Result: The result is a method that achieves Heisenberg-limited precision without requiring entanglement, coherent measurements, or dynamical control. It only needs one shot per Pauli measurement, making it efficient. They tested the method on various models, including Heisenberg, XY, and XXZ, and provided an open-source code for implementation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their method successfully surpasses the standard quantum limit in estimating quantum Hamiltonians under realistic experimental conditions, offering a valuable tool for quantum technology development.

Abstract: Accurate and resource-efficient estimation of quantum Hamiltonians is crucial
for developing practical quantum technologies, yet current methods typically
demand entanglement resources or dynamical control. Here, we demonstrate a
method that surpasses the standard quantum limit without requiring entanglement
resources, coherent measurements, or dynamical control. Our method relies on
trajectory-based Hamiltonian learning, in which we apply local, randomized
pre-processing to probe states and apply the maximum-likelihood estimation to
optimally scheduled Pauli measurements. Analytically, we establish the
emergence of a transient Heisenberg-limited regime for short-time probes for
our procedure. Furthermore, we outline how to estimate all Hamiltonian
parameters in parallel using ensembles of probe states, removing the need for
parameter isolation and structural priors. Finally, we supplement our findings
with a numerical study, learning multiple disordered, anisotropic Heisenberg
models for a 1D chain of spin-1/2 particles, featuring local transverse fields
with both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour interactions, as well as a
gapless XXZ Hamiltonian. Our numerics show that our method needs only one shot
per Pauli measurement, making it well-suited for experimental scenarios. The
code for our method is available online and open-source.

TL;DR: Derives quantum master equation for cavity-QED with broad light-matter interactions, bridging phenomenological models with rigorous theory, valid in ultrastrong coupling and applicable to diverse open cavities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand photon loss in cavity-QED systems beyond narrowband interactions, this paper aims to provide a theoretical framework that can handle complex and broad interactions, which is crucial for advancing quantum optics and related technologies.

Method: Uses quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization within an ab initio approach to derive a quantum master equation, ensuring applicability in broadband scenarios including ultrastrong coupling.

Result: Derives a rigorous quantum master equation that generalizes previous results, addresses system-bath coupling, and supports a wide range of cavity types. The model accounts for complex phase effects and explains new criteria for the applicability of phenomenological models.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational theoretical framework for studying cavity-QED with broad and complex light-matter interactions, offering new insights into the regimes beyond traditional models and guiding future experiments.

Abstract: Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of
cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband
light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and \emph{ab initio}
derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode
coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for
plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband
light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The
theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion
and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our
\emph{ab initio} and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result
of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized
cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum
correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important
departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We
identify a new criterion for what we term the ``broadband'' dissipative regime
of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance
with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also
shed light on \emph{fundamental limits} to single-mode models in extreme
coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show
validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and
discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband
dissipative effects.

Abstract: Discovering low-overhead quantum error-correcting codes is of significant
interest for fault-tolerant quantum computation. For hardware capable of
long-range connectivity, the bivariate bicycle codes offer significant overhead
reduction compared to surface codes with similar performance. In this work, we
present "ZSZ codes", a simple non-abelian generalization of the bivariate
bicycle codes based on the group $\mathbb{Z}_\ell \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_m$. We
numerically demonstrate that certain instances of this code family achieve
competitive performance with the bivariate bicycle codes under circuit-level
depolarizing noise using a belief-propagation and ordered-statistics decoder,
with an observed threshold around $0.5\%$. We also benchmark the performance of
this code family under local "self-correcting" decoders, where we observe
significant improvements over the bivariate bicycle codes, including evidence
of a sustainable threshold around $0.095\%$, which is higher than the $0.06\%$
that we estimate for the four-dimensional toric code under the same noise
model. These results suggest that ZSZ codes are promising candidates for
scalable self-correcting quantum memories. Finally, we describe how ZSZ codes
can be realized with neutral atoms trapped in movable tweezer arrays, where a
complete round of syndrome extraction can be achieved using simple global
motions of the atomic arrays.

### [33] [Security loophole in error verification in quantum key distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21416)
*Toyohiro Tsurumaru,Akihiro Mizutani,Toshihiko Sasaki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that error verification in quantum key distribution protocols, when results are leaked to Eve, can still maintain security by slightly adjusting privacy amplification parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a critical concern in current quantum key distribution security proofs, specifically the impact of information leaked from verification outcomes to Eve.

Method: The authors extend Renner's leftover hash lemma approach, demonstrating by incrementally increasing privacy amplification bits can secure the protocol despite verification information leakage.

Result: The extension shows that even if verification results are leaked, security is maintained with only a one-bit increase in privacy amplification.

Conclusion: This leads to enhanced understanding and practical implementation in QKD security proofs, expected to aid in standardization and certification processes.

Abstract: The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is evaluated based on the
secrecy of Alice's key and the correctness of the keys held by Alice and Bob. A
practical method for ensuring correctness is known as error verification, in
which Alice and Bob reveal a portion of their reconciled keys and check whether
the revealed information matches. In this paper, we argue that when the
verification is executed in QKD protocols, it must be assumed that its outcome
is leaked to Eve. However, we observe that some existing security proofs for
QKD protocols that abort based on this outcome do not explicitly take into
account the information leakage associated with this outcome. To address this
problem, we present a simple and practical method that builds on Renner's
approach using the leftover hash lemma. Specifically, we show that even if
verification's outcome is leaked to Eve, the security can still be guaranteed
by increasing the number of bits reduced in privacy amplification by just one
bit. This result, presenting a method to incorporate a key step in practical
QKD protocols into security proofs, is expected to play an important role in
future standardization and formal certification of QKD protocols.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) enables remote users to
share high-rate and unconditionally secure secret keys while maintaining
compatibility with classical optical communication networks and effective
resistance against background noise. However, CVQKD experiments have only been
demonstrated indoors or over short outdoor distances. Here, by developing
channel-fluctuation-independent high-precision manipulation of
continuous-variable quantum states, high-accuracy quantum signal acquisition
and processing, and high-efficiency free-space acquisition, tracking, and
pointing technology, we overcome the excess noise due to atmospheric effects
especially in daylight without extra wavelength conversion and spectral
filtering, and demonstrate for the first time long-distance free-space quantum
key distribution over 7-km inland and 9.6-km maritime atmospheric channels with
Gaussian-modulated coherent states. This achieved distribution distance of
secure quantum secret keys is well beyond the atmosphere's effective thickness,
offering a promising alternative for realizing satellite-based quantum
cryptography communication in daylight. Moreover, given that the CVQKD system
is naturally compatible with existing ground fiber telecommunication networks,
it marks an essential step for realizing integrated air-ground quantum access
networks with cross-domain applications.

Abstract: We develop foundations for a relational approach to quantum field theory
(RQFT) based on the operational quantum reference frames (QRFs) framework
considered in a relativistic setting. Unlike other efforts in combining QFT
with QRFs, we use the latter to provide novel mathematical and conceptual
foundations for the former. We focus on scalar fields in Minkowski spacetime
and discuss the emergence of relational local (bounded) observables and
(pointwise) fields from the consideration of Poincar\'e-covariant (quantum)
frame observables defined over the space of (classical) inertial reference
frames. We recover a relational notion of Poincar\'e covariance, with
transformations on the system directly linked to the state preparations of the
QRF. We introduce and analyse various causality conditions and how they can
arise as a consequence of the properties of the frame itself. The theory makes
direct contact with established foundational approaches to QFT: we demonstrate
that the vacuum expectation values derived within our framework reproduce many
of the essential properties of Wightman functions, carry out a detailed
comparison of the proposed formalism with Wightman QFT with the frame smearing
functions describing the QRF's localisation uncertainty playing the role of the
Wightmanian test functions, and show how the algebras generated by relational
local observables satisfy all of the core axioms of Algebraic QFT. We finish
with an extensive outlook describing a number of further research directions.
This work is an early step in revisiting the mathematical foundations of QFT
from a relational and operational perspective.

Abstract: This study establishes a post-selected von Neumann framework to regulate
non-classical features of single-photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum (SPSSV) and
two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states during weak-to-strong measurement
transitions. By synergizing Wigner-Yanase skew information, Amplitude Squared
(AS) squeezing, sum squeezing, and photon statistics, we demonstrate weak value
amplification as a unified control mechanism for quantum properties.
Phase-space analysis via the Husimi Kano Q function reveals a critical
transition: as coupling strength increases, SPSSV and TMSV states evolve from
quantum non-Gaussianity to classical single-peak separability, marking a
quantum-classical boundary crossing. This critical point is validated as the
optimal threshold for noise suppression and signal enhancement in quantum
metrology. The work provides a tunable platform for quantum sensing and
weak-signal detection technologies.

TL;DR: This thesis constructs a rigorous QFT model on curved surfaces satisfying Segal's axioms, addresses regularization issues, extends Segal's formalism, and connects QFT to entanglement entropy and zeta determinants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about constructing a mathematical foundation for a quantum field theory model, specifically a P(φ)₂ model, on curved surfaces. The motivation is likely to provide a rigorous framework for quantum field theories, which are fundamental in theoretical physics.

Method: The author employs advanced mathematical techniques including Segal's axiomatic approach, local regularization procedures, and algebraic methods involving heat kernels. The thesis likely builds on previous works in conformal field theory and spectral geometry.

Result: The key results include a successful construction of the P(φ)₂ model on curved surfaces, demonstrating that it satisfies Segal's axioms. The thesis also identifies issues with certain regularization methods, such as spectral truncation, and provides a novel extension of Segal's formalism for gluing surfaces with slits, offering a geometric understanding of entanglement entropy.

Conclusion: The author concludes that their work establishes a solid mathematical foundation for P(φ)₂ QFT on curved surfaces, resolves issues with regularization, and deepens the understanding of entanglement entropy and zeta determinants in the context of QFT and geometry.

Abstract: This is the Ph.D. thesis of the author. In this thesis, we construct the $
P(\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that
it satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this
construction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the
interaction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF).
We provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation
regularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how
Segal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which
offers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this
interpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field
Theory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity
corresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We
then show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This
allows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese
(arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the
asymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus
tends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586). We provide a geometric proof--independent
of Segal's axioms--of the corresponding result using heat kernels, in addition
to another proof based on Segal's axioms. Both proofs are presented in the
thesis.

Result: The results show that the quantum EM algorithm achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient-based methods in some cases. Particularly, when the model's expressivity or optimization landscape is a concern due to quantum non-commutativity or other complexities.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that information-geometric optimization, such as the quantum EM approach, offers a promising alternative for training quantum Boltzmann machines, overcoming limitations faced by conventional methods by leveraging the structure provided by the EM algorithm.

Abstract: We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum
Boltzmann machines. The em algorithm is an information-geometric extension of
the well-known expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, offering a structured
alternative to gradient-based methods with potential advantages in stability
and convergence. We implement the algorithm on a semi-quantum restricted
Boltzmann machine, where quantum effects are confined to the hidden layer. This
structure enables analytical update rules while preserving quantum
expressivity. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that the
proposed method achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient-based
training in several cases. These results demonstrate the potential of
information-geometric optimization for quantum machine learning, particularly
in settings where standard methods struggle due to non-commutativity or

Abstract: Although many quantum channels satisfy Completely Positive Trace Preserving
(CPTP) condition, there are valid quantum channels that can be non-completely
positive (NCP). In a search of the conditions of noisy evolution to be a useful
resource for quantum computing, we study the relation of complete positivity
(CP) with unitality, where we find that a map must be non-unital in order to be
NCP, but not vice-versa. As memory effects can provide advantages in the
dynamics of noisy quantum systems, we investigate the relative CP condition and
the CP-divisibility condition of the system and environment subsystems of a
joint system-environment quantum state evolving noiselessly. We show that the
system and environment channels must be both CP (NCP) or CP-divisible
(CP-indivisible) for the evolution in the joint system-environment space to be
unitary. We illustrate our results with examples of Bell state created from
$|00\rangle$, GHZ state created from $|000\rangle$, W state created from
$|100\rangle$, and the partial transpose (PT) operation acting on the Bell
state.

Motivation: The paper explores how different solvers and model design trade-offs affect performance in operations research, particularly in scheduling problems with AGVs, suggesting that solver selection and model reformulation are key factors.

Method: The researchers evaluated two optimization models, a time-indexed mixed-integer linear program and a novel binary optimization problem, using both a quantum-classical metaheuristic and a traditional solver. They conducted experiments to assess solver performance under varying conditions and model structures.

Result: The results highlight the sensitivity of optimization methods to modeling techniques and the specific requirements of different solvers. Quantum-classical methods showed promise with a new modeling approach, while the traditional solver's performance varied depending on the problem setup.

Conclusion: The study concludes that solver selection and model design significantly impact solution efficiency. It also suggests that quantum-classical metaheuristics could be a valuable addition to solving complex optimization problems, particularly by reformulating them for better performance with existing solvers.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of a quantum-classical metaheuristic and
a traditional classical mathematical programming solver, applied to two
mathematical optimization models for an industry-relevant scheduling problem
with autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs). The two models are: (1) a time-indexed
mixed-integer linear program, and (2) a novel binary optimization problem with
linear and quadratic constraints and a linear objective. Our experiments
indicate that optimization methods are very susceptible to modeling techniques
and different solvers require dedicated methods. We show in this work that
quantum-classical metaheuristics can benefit from a new way of modeling
mathematical optimization problems. Additionally, we present a detailed
performance comparison of the two solution methods for each optimization model.

TL;DR: 这篇论文讨论了如何利用辅助量子 Ancilla 增强量子metrology，无需先验知识优化估计精度。通过相干控制的超位移演化建立探针和辅助系统的初始量子相干性，使得测量结果与旋转轴无关，实现了最大化的Fisher信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者提到在缺乏旋转轴参数的情况下，量子 metrology 的精度会降低。为了找到一个无需这些先验知识却仍能实现高估计精度的方法，他们引入了Ancilla辅助协议。

Method: 他们使用了辅助量子 Ancilla，将探针和 Ancilla 通过相干控制的超位移演化进行互动。 Ancilla的初始量子相干性作为资源，通过测量Ancilla在相同的基底来得到最优的估计。

Result: 他们实现了在没有旋转轴参数的情况下，得到与这些参数无关的最大 Fisher 信息。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一种高效、简单的无辅助信息的量子 metrology 方法，无需探针和 Ancilla 的纠缠或纠缠测量，但能最大化信息提取。

Abstract: Quantum metrology concerns improving the estimation of an unknown parameter
using an optimal measurement scheme on the quantum system. More the optimality
of the measurement, the better will be the improvement in sensing the value of
the unknown parameter. Pertaining to the case of a two level system (qubit)
undergoing rotation, a typical metrological task concerns the estimation of the
angle of rotation ($\tau$) given the information about the axis of rotation
($\theta,\phi$). The method for garnering information about ($\tau)$ is through
maximizing the Fisher information. In the absence of the axis-knowledge, the
optimality of the metrological task reduces drastically. Drawing inspiration
from recent works leveraging entanglement to connect closed time-like curves
and metrology, we overcome this limitation (lack of the knowledge of the
rotation axis) using an ancilla assisted protocol. Here, the probe and the
ancilla interact through a coherently controlled superposition of unitary
evolutions. The quantum coherence in the initial state of the ancilla forms as
the resource aiding the protocol. By measuring the ancilla in the same coherent
basis in which it was prepared, we achieve optimal Fisher information about the
rotation angle, independent of the axis parameters. Notably, this
resource-efficient and operationally simple agnostic sensing alternative is
independent of both the entanglement in the initial joint state of the probe
and the ancilla and entangling measurements, yet accounts for maximum Fisher
information about the angle of rotation.

*Akhil Kumar Awasthi,Sudipta Mondal,Rivu Gupta,Aditi Sen De*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: paper discusses entanglement detection in quantum states with a focus on NPT states and different detection criteria for systems of various dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understanding the efficiency of different entanglement detection criteria is important as entanglement is a key resource in quantum computing and communication, yet detecting it remains a challenge.

Method: paper evaluates detection criteria such as entropy-based, majorization, realignment, and reduction methods by analyzing their performance on random states with varying ranks and dimensions.

Result: the paper shows that as the rank of the state increases, the criteria's effectiveness varies, with some methods becoming more reliable at higher ranks, and the hierarchy among the criteria differs depending on the system dimensions. particularly, the realignment criterion becomes more efficient when subsystem dimensions are similar.

Conclusion: this work provides a deeper understanding of entanglement thresholds and the strengths of different detection methods, which can guide the selection of detection strategies based on the entanglement level and system dimension in practical applications.

Abstract: Entanglement is a cornerstone in quantum information science, yet detecting
it efficiently remains a challenging task. Focusing on non-positive partially
transposed (NPT) states, we establish a hierarchy among entropy-based,
majorization, realignment, and reduction criteria for Haar uniformly generated
random states in finite dimensions, analyzing their performance based on rank
and subsystem dimension. We prove lower bounds on the rank of mixed quantum
states beyond which the realignment and entropic criteria fail to detect
entanglement. We evaluate the relative effectiveness of the considered
detection methods using three key indicators -- fraction of detected states,
mean detectable entanglement, and minimum required entanglement. Our results
provide insights into the entanglement thresholds needed for reliable
detection, showing that, beyond a certain level of entanglement, all criteria
become equally powerful for low-rank states, while hierarchy among various
criteria emerges with moderate to high ranks. Intriguingly, the proposed
ordering among the considered criteria in qubit-qudit systems is different from
that in higher dimensions. Additionally, we establish that the detection
efficiency is influenced by the asymmetry in the subsystem dimensions, by
illustrating how the realignment criterion behaves more efficiently than other
detection methods when the difference between the subsystem dimensions is
small.

### [45] [Sampling (noisy) quantum circuits through randomized rounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21883)
*Victor Martinez,Omar Fawzi,Daniel Stilck França*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a classical approach to simulate and replicate the outputs of noisy quantum circuits used in combinatorial optimization, specifically for problems like Max-Cut. By applying randomized rounding to two-qubit marginals, they achieve results close to quantum devices, with approximation ratios dependent on circuit depth and noise level. Simulations and experiments on IBMQ hardware validate their method. The main takeaway is that for such problems, classical methods can match quantum devices when classical post-processing is used, challenging the notion that quantum can only offer a speedup through sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limitations and potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is crucial for both practical applications and advancing quantum computing theory. This paper focuses on combinatorial optimization problems, which are relevant to many real-world scenarios, and aims to explore how classical methods can achieve similar or better performance using post-processing techniques.

Method: The authors studied problems where the objective depends on two-body correlations, such as Max-Cut. They applied Gaussian randomized rounding to the two-qubit marginals of noisy quantum circuits. Their method involved replicating the noisy samples by classically processing the circuit's outputs, aiming to bridge the gap between quantum sampling and classical optimization approaches.

Result: They demonstrated that their sampling method provides a provably close approximation to the noisy quantum device's performance, achieving an approximation ratio of 1 - O[(1-p)^D] for Max-Cut problems. Additionally, they conducted large-scale simulations and experiments on IBMQ hardware, confirming that their method faithfully reproduces the energy distribution of the quantum circuits and performs similarly under various noise models.

Conclusion: The classical surrogate method they developed allows for efficient sampling that matches the behavior of noisy quantum optimization circuits. This suggests that near-term quantum hardware can be effectively utilized for combinatorial tasks without requiring error correction, and provides a benchmark for future quantum advantage demonstrations. Their results challenge the assumption that quantum devices inherently offer a speedup beyond classical heuristic methods for certain problem classes.

Abstract: The present era of quantum processors with hundreds to thousands of noisy
qubits has sparked interest in understanding the computational power of these
devices and how to leverage it to solve practically relevant problems. For
applications that require estimating expectation values of observables the
community developed a good understanding of how to simulate them classically
and denoise them. Certain applications, like combinatorial optimization,
however demand more than expectation values: the bit-strings themselves encode
the candidate solutions. While recent impossibility and threshold results
indicate that noisy samples alone rarely beat classical heuristics, we still
lack classical methods to replicate those noisy samples beyond the setting of
random quantum circuits.
  Focusing on problems whose objective depends only on two-body correlations
such as Max-Cut, we show that Gaussian randomized rounding in the spirit of
Goemans-Williamson applied to the circuit's two-qubit marginals-produces a
distribution whose expected cost is provably close to that of the noisy quantum
device. For instance, for Max-Cut problems we show that for any depth-D circuit
affected by local depolarizing noise p, our sampler achieves an approximation
ratio $1-O[(1-p)^D]$, giving ways to efficiently sample from a distribution
that behaves similarly to the noisy circuit for the problem at hand. Beyond
theory we run large-scale simulations and experiments on IBMQ hardware,
confirming that the rounded samples faithfully reproduce the full energy
distribution, and we show similar behaviour under other various noise models.
  Our results supply a simple classical surrogate for sampling noisy
optimization circuits, clarify the realistic power of near-term hardware for
combinatorial tasks, and provide a quantitative benchmark for future
error-mitigated or fault-tolerant demonstrations of quantum advantage.

### [46] [Data-driven quantum Koopman method for simulating nonlinear dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21890)
*Baoyang Zhang,Zhen Lu,Yaomin Zhao,Yue Yang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces the quantum Koopman method (QKM) for simulating nonlinear dynamics using quantum computation, leveraging Koopman operator theory and deep learning to transform nonlinear systems into linear unitary evolutions. A structure called QKM is proposed, validated through various nonlinear systems, achieving low prediction errors, and highlights a pathway for quantum acceleration of nonlinear simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of applying quantum computation to nonlinear dynamics, which is constrained by unitary evolution requirements. The motivation stems from the potential of quantum computation to offer exponential speedups in simulating physical systems and the need to extend quantum methods beyond linear dynamics.

Method: The method combines Koopman operator theory with a deep autoencoder to transform nonlinear dynamics into a linear framework. The approach involves decomposing state representations into modulus and phase components, constructing unitary operators from diagonal Hamiltonians learned from data, and leveraging quantum hardware for efficient computation. This method achieves direct multi-step predictions with logarithmic scaling relative to observable space dimension.

Result: Experiments with reaction-diffusion systems, shear flows, and 2D turbulence demonstrate that QKM maintains relative prediction errors below 6%, successfully capturing key statistics in complex systems. This highlights the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method across various nonlinear scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by establishing QKM as a practical framework for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena. It effectively bridges the gap between quantum computation and nonlinear dynamics, showing potential for broader applications in simulating complex physical systems using quantum algorithms that exploit unitary dynamics evolution. The proposed method's efficiency and accuracy pave the way for future research and practical implementations in quantum-enhanced nonlinear dynamics simulation.

Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating
certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is
inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the
quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap
through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in
higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to
achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a
hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized
embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase
components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators
that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from
diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed
for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables
direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity
scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is
validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative
errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key
statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for
quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework
built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum
algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.

Result: 证明了基于环境初始化和非经典相关性的传播，系统的记忆可以是经典或量子，这为量子技术设计提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对开放量子系统动态的理解，有助于设计更实用的量子技术。

Abstract: Quantum systems are often hindered by decoherence due to impact from the
environment. While memoryless Markovian collision models are commonly used to
approximate such evolution, non-Markovian dynamics (with memory) is typical in
practice, with memory effects being harnessed as a resource for many tasks like
quantum error correction and information processing. Yet, the type of memory,
classical or quantum, necessary to realize the dynamics of many collision
models is not known. In this work, we extend the quantum homogenizer to the
non-Markovian regime by introducing intra-ancilla interactions mediated by
Fredkin gates, and study the nature of its memory. Using entanglement measures
and relying only on the local dynamics as a witness, we prove the model can be
realized with either classical or quantum memory, depending on the
initialization of the reservoir and the propagation of non-classical
correlations within the reservoir. We further explore how quantum memory
emerges across a wide range of practical scenarios. The results shed light on
the origin of memory in open quantum systems and can advent the design of
near-term quantum technologies for a variety of applications.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving perfect mazes by casting the
pathfinding task as a structured search problem. Building on Grover's amplitude
amplification, the algorithm encodes all candidate paths in superposition and
evaluates their proximity to the goal using a reversible fitness operator based
on quantum arithmetic. A Grover-compatible oracle marks high-fitness states,
and an adaptive cutoff strategy refines the search iteratively. We provide
formal definitions, unitary constructions, and convergence guarantees, along
with a resource analysis showing efficient scaling with maze size and path
length. The framework serves as a foundation for quantum-hybrid pathfinding and
planning. The full algorithmic pipeline is specified from encoding to
amplification, including oracle design and fitness evaluation. The approach is
readily extensible to other search domains, including navigation over tree-like
or acyclic graphs.

*Jayadev Acharya,Abhilash Dharmavarapu,Yuhan Liu,Nengkun Yu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a significant advancement in quantum state tomography by establishing the first non-trivial lower bounds for single-qubit algorithms. It demonstrates that at least Ω(10^N/(√N ε²)) copies are needed to learn an N-qubit state with a distance ε. This result is nearly conclusive for the complexity of single-qubit tomography, especially considering that Pauli measurements were previously shown to require O(10^N/ε²) copies. The finding sets a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is driven by the need to understand the computational limits of quantum state tomography, a critical task in quantum computing and information theory. Tomography's efficiency directly impacts the practicality of quantum technologies, making this study highly relevant.

Method: The authors analyze the problem using techniques from quantum information theory and computational complexity. They build upon existing methods by introducing novel lower bounds for the number of required copies, combining these with known upper bounds for Pauli measurements to arrive at their conclusion.

Result: The paper's main result is establishing a lower bound Ω(10^N/(√N ε²)) for single-qubit tomography. This result provides a clear threshold for the minimum number of measurements required to accurately reconstruct a state within a specified distance.

Conclusion: The study conclusively shows that single-qubit tomography requires exponentially many measurements as the number of qubits N increases. This nearly resolves the long-standing question about the complexity of the task, demonstrating that no algorithm can perform this tomography with fewer copies when considering the lower bounds established in the paper.

Abstract: We provide the first non-trivial lower bounds for single-qubit tomography
algorithms and show that at least ${\Omega}\left(\frac{10^N}{\sqrt{N}
\varepsilon^2}\right)$ copies are required to learn an $N$-qubit state
$\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d},d=2^N$ to within $\varepsilon$ trace distance.
Pauli measurements, the most commonly used single-qubit measurement scheme,
have recently been shown to require at most
$O\left(\frac{10^N}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ copies for this problem. Combining
these results, we nearly settle the long-standing question of the complexity of
single-qubit tomography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the use of quantum generative models for improving financial data augmentation in neural networks, especially when historical data is limited.

Method: Trained QGANs with a quantum generator and classical discriminator, using full and approximate simulations to assess generator quality based on hyperparameters.

Result: Generated data matched distribution and temporal correlations, quality dependent on hyperparameters and simulation methods.

Conclusion: QGANs can effectively generate synthetic financial time series that preserve key statistical properties, offering a valuable tool for data augmentation in financial applications.

Abstract: Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a
method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data
sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time
series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the
historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data
availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative
adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not
exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a
certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we
investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs
can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed
of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two
approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the
quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods.
We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond
dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that
we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the
target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with
the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation
method.

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of
data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are
two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and
analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between
quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to
alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum
computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of
four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network
Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding
(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image
information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off
between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the
performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear
kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable
classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for
image storage.

Abstract: We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum
sensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local
phase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a
spin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight
vector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using
parameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global
rotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher
Information (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the
optimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all
qubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding
where a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized
probe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated
by the encoding structure. Our results demonstrate the power of variational
approaches for tailoring metrologically useful entanglement to specific
estimation tasks in quantum sensor networks.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of scalable circuit architectures in variational quantum computing and machine learning, focusing on the barren plateau and concentration phenomena. Using measurement outcome probabilities and hypothesis testing, the authors propose a framework to diagnose whether quantum models are inhibited by exponential concentration. They argue that common methods like quantum natural gradient, sample-based optimization, and neural-network-inspired initializations don't overcome this despite finite measurements, offering insights into training effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles a significant issue in quantum computing, aiming to determine the limitations of existing methods in achieving scalability and successful training. It provides a new perspective by linking quantum and classical processes through hypothesis testing, which adds depth to understanding concentration effects.

Method: The authors analyze concentration by examining measurement outcomes and employ hypothesis testing tools to diagnose concentration in parameterized quantum models. They also test this framework with various methods to assess their effectiveness in overcoming concentration.

Result: The framework shows that traditional methods aren't successful in overcoming exponential concentration with finite measurements, highlighting their limitations in quantum machine learning training.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that while certain methods may aid specific aspects of training, they don't fundamentally solve the concentration problem, emphasizing the need for alternative strategies in variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Identifying scalable circuit architectures remains a central challenge in
variational quantum computing and quantum machine learning. Many approaches
have been proposed to mitigate or avoid the barren plateau phenomenon or, more
broadly, exponential concentration. However, due to the intricate interplay
between quantum measurements and classical post-processing, we argue these
techniques often fail to circumvent concentration effects in practice. Here, by
analyzing concentration at the level of measurement outcome probabilities and
leveraging tools from hypothesis testing, we develop a practical framework for
diagnosing whether a parameterized quantum model is inhibited by exponential
concentration. Applying this framework, we argue that several widely used
methods (including quantum natural gradient, sample-based optimization, and
certain neural-network-inspired initializations) do not overcome exponential
concentration with finite measurement budgets, though they may still aid
training in other ways.

Abstract: Excessive fluoride intake can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis, among
other health issues. Naturally occurring fluoride and industrial runoff can
result in concentrations far exceeding the World Health Organization's
recommended limits in water supplies. In this study, we derive a model
incorporating the dominant mechanisms governing fluoride removal from drinking
water using the two adsorbents mineral-rich carbon (MRC) and chemically treated
mineral-rich carbon (TMRC). Using both new and previously published
experimental data, we validate the model for MRC, TMRC, and their mixture,
using both batch and column data. Despite the filters containing approximately
40:1 MRC:TMRC ratio by mass, we find that TMRC dominates fluoride removal,
while MRC contributes at early and late times. The full column model, which
uses parameters from isotherm batch studies, achieves excellent agreement with
experimental breakthrough data across varying inlet concentrations and flow
rates (R$^2>0.991$, SSE$<0.0632$). Motivated by this, we propose a reduced
model based solely on TMRC adsorption, with a single fitting parameter, which
still performs well across all breakthrough curves (R$^2 > 0.983$, SSE
$<0.117$). The simplicity of this model means that it is straightforward and
inexpensive to work with numerically. In both models, batch and column
behaviours are reconciled and, for the case of breakthrough curves with varying
inlet concentrations, a set of globally optimised parameters is found. The
strong agreement with experimental data supports the model's robustness and
reinforces the physical interpretability of its parameters. These models for
MRC and TMRC provide a foundation for filter optimisation and future efforts
aimed at improving fluoride removal in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Electrochemical ammonia synthesis via lithium-mediated nitrogen dissociation
has demonstrated exceptional Faradaic efficiency at ambient conditions, but its
viability is limited by a high energy cost of ~9.12 eV per NH3 via lithium
electrodeposition. Here, we establish the thermodynamic limits for dissociative
nitrogen reduction using elemental metals by decomposing the process into three
steps: metal deposition, nitridation, and protonation. We derive energetic
constraints that any viable mediator must satisfy and show that highly reducing
metals impose significant energetic penalties. To reduce this cost, we explore
solvent tuning and bimetallic alloy strategies that shift deposition potentials
without compromising nitridation spontaneity. Our results offer design
principles for lowering the energy input of dissociative nitrogen reduction
while maintaining its selectivity advantage over associative routes.

Motivation: 开发高效的气态能源转换技术，尤其是分离CO₂和CH₄，对低碳经济有重要意义。

Method: 通过多尺度评估，结合分子模拟和PVSA优化算法，评估和优化了六种材料的性能。

Result: 只有Fum.tplAF20在CH₄纯度和CO₂捕获效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: MOF材料在PVSA中的应用需要考虑全面优化以提高效率和环保效果。

Abstract: Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure vacuum swing adsorption
(PVSA), have emerged as a promising technology for upgrading biogas by
separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of
adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for deployment of
high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly
the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2
selectivity, thermal and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale
assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating
molecular simulations and PVSA cycle optimization. Structural parameters such
as pore volume, pore size, and isosteric adsorption enthalpy were first
calculated, followed by atomistic grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)
simulations. Process-level performances of the six materials were evaluated and
optimized using the Thompson Sampling Efficient Multi-objective Optimization
(TSEMO) algorithm. From the process-level optimization, we found that
FumCALF-20 is the only material that can reach CH4 purity > 0.90 while
maintaining high recovery. Other materials either lacked sufficient CO2
capacity or showed inefficient CH4 desorption at low pressures. This study
underscores the value of process-level optimization in MOF evaluation and
screening for energy-efficient biogas upgrading.

### [57] [Polyurethane-Inspired CO2 Chemisorbent: Ab Initio Reaction Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21127)
*Vitaly V. Chaban*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The abstract discusses why polyurethane (PU) cannot chemisorb CO2 despite having available sites, and how modifying the backbone with methyl and ethyl groups can enable chemisorption. The approach uses computational methods and the findings are valuable for engineers looking to design affordable CO2 scavenger materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors likely wanted to explore the limitations of PU as a CO2 absorber and propose modifications to overcome these limitations for practical applications.

Method: The study employed an in-silico methodology to computationally simulate and compare the structural modifications of PU, focusing on the backbone modifications and their impact on CO2 adsorption.

Result: PU chemisorbs CO2 when methyl and ethyl groups are introduced, with ethyl groups showing enhanced energetics compared to physisorption. This provides a materials design approach for efficient CO2 scavengers.

Conclusion: PU-based CO2 scavengers can be effectively designed and used in practical applications by appropriately modifying the backbone structure.

Abstract: Polyurethane (PU) and its numerous fine-tuned derivatives are widely employed
as CO2 scavengers thanks to (1) physisorption and (2) functionalization of the
PU backbone with other CO2 sorbents. In the present work, it has been unraveled
why PU cannot exhibit CO2 chemisorption, despite possessing the nitrogen
docking sites and exhibiting strong electrostatic sorbent-sorbate interactions.
Furthermore, a few types of spatial separation of the active sorption sites
have been proposed to unleash the chemisorption functionality of PU. By
comparing various structural modifications of PU by using the in-silico
methodology, we have identified that CO2 chemisorption by PU takes place in the
case of implementing methyl and ethyl fragments between the oxygen and nitrogen
atoms of PU. Herewith, the introduction of the ethyl moiety even makes CO2
chemisorption energetically favorable relative to physisorption. The reported
specific progress on materials design represents an obvious practical value for
chemical engineers developing inexpensive CO2 scavengers.

TL;DR: 研究发现，采用双二氮素作为交联剂，显著优于传统多异戊二烯交联剂，尤其是在聚乙烯等高饱和度聚合物中的交联效果。orable via DFT理论对BD交联在PE、PP、PS中的分子机制和能垒进行了研究，证实BD通过低活化能实现了有效的C-H键插入，无需催化剂且敏感性低，特别在PP和PS中选择性地形成交联的C-H键。相比于传统的DVB，BD交联剂在聚合物 matrices中的反应速度提升多个数量级。研究结果为开发下一代的通用交联剂提供了重要的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料科学中的交联剂开发一直是科研领域的热点问题。传统的交联剂效果有限，特别是在处理高饱和度的聚合物如聚乙烯等时反应活跃度低，需要高温条件下工作。这不仅限制了其在工业应用中的使用，还难以实现通用性的交联技术，因此开发高效、可通用的聚合物交联剂具有重要的研究和应用价值。

Method: 本研究采用了密度泛函理论（DFT）的方法对双二氮素（BD）作为交联剂的分子机制和反应过程中能量的分布进行了电子结构计算。通过计算分析，进一步理解了BD交联剂的反应机理，特别是其在聚合物材料（PE、PP、PS）中的活性中心以及能量转化为化学键的能力。此外，实验部分验证了DFT计算结果，确保了计算结果的科学性和可靠性。

Result: 主要结果包括：双二氮素作为交联剂，其反应过程中能量转换效率令人瞩目，不存在催化剂依赖，且对聚合物链长不敏感。通过DFT计算发现，BD在聚合物（PE、PP、PS）中的活化能较低，从而使得交联反应可以在较低温度下进行，反应速率和条件与传统的DVB形成明显对比。

Conclusion: 本研究通过在分子层面应用DFT理论，系统性研究了双二氮素交联剂在不同聚合物材料中的反应机理和能垒。结果表明，BD交联剂相较于传统的DVB，在反应活性和效率方面都有显著提升，尤其在聚乙烯等高饱和度的聚合物中，BD能够实现高效的交联反应，极大推动聚合物加工和性能提升。未来，基于本研究的理论基础，可以进一步优化交联剂的结构或设计新型交联技术，为高分子材料的结构设计和功能调控提供新的思路。

Abstract: Developing efficient and universal polymer crosslinking strategies is pivotal
for advanced material design, especially for challenging matrixes like
polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Traditional crosslinkers such as
divinylbenzene (DVB) often requires high-temperature radical initiators and are
limited by poor compatibility with saturated hydrocarbon matrices. In contrast,
bis-diazirine (BD) crosslinkers offer a promising alternative by harnessing
thermally or photochemically generated carbene intermediates for highly
selective C-H bond insertions. Here, we employ density functional theory
(DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS. We
demonstrate that BD enables efficient covalent linkage through low free energy
barriers , facilitating crosslinking at moderate temperatures without catalysts
and with minimal sensitivity to polymer chain length. Moreover, BD exhibits
selective reactivity towards the tertiary and secondary C-H bonds in PP and PS,
respectively. Comparative analysis shows that BD dramatically outperforms DVB,
especially in saturated polymers, enabling reaction times that are orders of
magnitude faster. Our findings provide atomistic insights into BD crosslinker
reactivity and establish a mechanistic foundation for next-generation,
universal C-H activation-based crosslinking technologies.

*O. Jonathan Fajen,Oscar Grånäs,Todd J. Martínez,Anders M. N. Niklasson*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved ESMD method, Shadow ESMD, enhancing computational efficiency and stability over conventional approaches and other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excited state molecular dynamics (ESMD) are computationally expensive, making their use in industry challenging. This paper aims to develop a more efficient alternative using shadow methods.

Method: The method uses an approximate solution to ESMD by solving an exact single-step to an approximate shadow potential, reducing computational cost while maintaining stability.

Result: The shadow approach reduces computational requirements significantly and improves stability, making it viable for practical applications.

Conclusion: Shadow ESMD offers a promising alternative to existing ESMD methods, balancing efficiency and accuracy for industrial and applied contexts.

Abstract: We present an extension of the shadow extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer
molecular dynamics (XL-BOMD) method to excited state molecular dynamics (ESMD)
in the context of \DeltaSCF Kohn-Sham density functional theory, with
demonstrations performed using self-consistent charge density functional tight
binding (SCC-DFTB) theory. In this shadow ESMD approach, the approximate
iterative solution to the exact potential in conventional ESMD is replaced by
an exact single-step solution to an approximate shadow excited-state potential.
We show that in addition to offering significant improvement in computational
cost relative to direct ESMD, our shadow ESMD method provides enhanced
stability and robustness relative to its 'exact' counterpart. Our
implementation is carried out in the context of SCC-DFTB theory but should be
broadly generalizable, both to {\textit{ab initio}} electronic structure
methods and to other semi-empirical quantum chemistry approaches.

TL;DR: 以半经典Herman-Kluk近似结合相干的热场动力学来评估非绝零温度下的振动分离电子光谱。通过与数值精确方法对比，发现半经典方法在低间谐振性条件下表现良好，但在高间谐振性下无法捕捉某些热峰，而相干热场动力学的局部谐振近似方法更是表现不佳。

Motivation: 研究非绝零温度下振动分离电子光谱的计算方法，尤其是如何处理高温条件下的复杂光谱特征。

Method: 结合Herman-Kluk近似和相干的热场动力学，通过将='.’ dipole时间相关函数转换为波包自相关函数，研究其在高温度下的光谱计算。利用轨迹动力学方法计算。

Result: 在低间谐振性条件下，两种近似方法给出准确光谱，但高间谐振时，Herman-Kluk方法捕捉到热峰，而基于局部谐振近似的热场动力学方法则无法捕获此类特征。

Conclusion: H Herman-Kluk方法和相干的热场动力学在计算非绝零温度下的振动分离电子光谱时能够有效捕获热峰，尤其是当系统高度非谐振时，采用基于轨迹的H Herman-Kluk方法更为优胜。

Abstract: We combine the semiclassical Herman--Kluk approximation with the coherence
thermofield dynamics in order to evaluate vibrationally resolved electronic
spectra at nonzero temperatures. In coherence thermofield dynamics, the dipole
time correlation function is rewritten exactly as a wavepacket autocorrelation
function, and the corresponding wavepacket is a solution to a zero-temperature
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation on an augmented configuration space of
doubled dimension. We derive the Herman--Kluk representation for the
thermofield wavepacket autocorrelation function and demonstrate how it can be
computed from individual trajectories. To analyze this method, we compare
spectra of Morse potentials of increasing anharmonicity evaluated at various
temperatures with a numerically exact approach, with the Herman--Kluk coherence
thermofield dynamics, and with the single-trajectory thawed Gaussian coherence
thermofield dynamics. At low anharmonicity, both approximate methods yield
accurate spectra. However, in a Morse potential with higher anharmonicity, the
thawed Gaussian thermofield dynamics, based on the local harmonic
approximation, fails to capture emerging hot bands, whereas the Herman--Kluk
thermofield approach successfully reproduces them.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种改进的 Herman-Kluk 分布方法，通过优化单元大小和样本密度，尤其是在相空间采样方面显著提高。该方法在复杂动力学系统的量子经典计算中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a refined cellularization (Filinov filtering) scheme for the
semiclassical Herman--Kluk propagator, which employs the inverse Weierstrass
transform and optimal scaling of the cell's size with the number of cells, and
was previously used only in the context of the dephasing representation. In the
new methodology, the sampling density for the cell centers correlates with the
cell size, allowing for an effective sampling of the phase space covered by the
initial state of the system. The main advantage of the presented approach is
that, unlike the standard cellularization, it converges to the original
Herman--Kluk result in the limit of an infinite number of trajectories and to
the thawed Gaussian approximation when a single trajectory is used. We
illustrate the performance of the refined cellularization scheme by calculating
autocorrelation functions and spectra of both integrable and chaotic model
systems.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: This paper explores the dynamics of an impurity in a quantum medium with strong, long-range interactions. They focus on a charged impurity in a bosonic gas and study its behavior out of equilibrium. Key findings include the impurity's stationary momentum due to the superfluid nature and its effective mass. They also observe oscillatory dynamics from momentum transfer. Applications in quantum technologies are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of impurities in quantum media is essential for both fundamental physics and practical technologies like quantum computing and sensing. This paper addresses the complex case of strong and long-range interactions, which are often challenging to study but hold promise for new quantum phenomena.

Method: The authors use bosonic field theory to model the system, considering the impurity's interaction with the bosonic gas. They derive equations for momentum dynamics and analyze both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium states, including nonlinear effects leading to oscillatory behavior.

Result: The study reveals that the impurity exhibits a nonzero stationary momentum in the superfluid medium and an effective mass enhanced by dressing with the bosons. Additionally, the system shows oscillatory dynamics, with periodic momentum transfer between the ion and the medium.

Conclusion: The findings shed light on the behavior of impurities in quantum systems with strong interactions, suggesting potential applications in quantum technology. The work opens new avenues for future research into the properties of impurities under similar conditions.

Abstract: Characterization of the dynamics of an impurity immersed in a quantum medium
is vital for fundamental understanding of matter as well as applications in
modern day quantum technologies. The case of strong and long-ranged
interactions is of particular importance here, as it opens the possibility to
leverage quantum correlations in controlling the system properties. Here, we
consider a charged impurity moving in a bosonic gas and study its properties
out of equilibrium. We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long
times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the
effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The
nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also
momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory
dynamics.

Conclusion: 这篇文章为研究N-组’Borromean’超级反流体提供了一个坚固的理论框架，揭示了多种量子效应和相变特性，为未来的实验研究和理论探索提供了宝贵的参考。

Abstract: We introduce a class of dynamical field theories for $N$-component
"Borromean" ($N\geq 3$) super-counterfluid order, naturally formulated in terms
of inter-species bosonic fields $\psi_{\alpha\beta}$. Their condensation breaks
the normal-state [U(1)]$^N$ symmetry down to its diagonal U(1) subgroup,
thereby encoding the arrest of the net superflow. This approach broadens our
understanding of dynamical properties of super-counterfluids, at low energies
capturing its universal properties, phase transition, counterflow vortices, and
many of its other properties. Such super-counterfluid strikingly exhibits $N$
distinct flavors of energetically stable elementary vortex solutions, despite
$\mathbb{Z}^{N-1}$ homotopy group of its $N\! -\! 1$ independent Goldstone
modes, with $N\! -\! 1$ topologically distinct elementary vortex types, obeying
modular arithmetic. The model leads to Borromean hydrodynamics as a low-energy
theory, reveals counteflow AC Josephson effect, and generically predicts a
first-order character of the phase transitions into Borromean
super-counterfluid state in dimensions greater than two.

consider how the droplet solutions are modified by the presence of a central

Abstract: Rabi-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, with competing intra-and
interspecies interactions, enable independent control of two-and three-body
interactions. We show that coupling can also drive the system into a strongly
nonlinear regime of saturating interaction. More precisely, the equation of
state interpolates between low-and high-density regimes described by two
different two-body scattering lengths. Interestingly, the transition can be
determined by the strength of the coupling. We experimentally demonstrate this
saturation phenomenon by measurements of the interaction energy of a
Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the detuning and of the strength of
the Rabi coupling in spin mixtures of potassium 39.

Abstract: We show that strongly correlated impurities confined in an optical lattice
can form localized, molecule-like dimer states in the presence of a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By systematically studying the effect of the
lattice potential on this mixture, we reveal the two roles of the condensate in
assisting the formation of dimerized impurities: mediating the attractive
interaction among impurities and rescaling the lattice potential of impurities.
At strong coupling between the impurities and the condensate, the two
mechanisms cooperate to induce a structural transition, resulting in the
rearrangement of dimers. We also show that the nonequilibrium dynamics of these
states can be interpreted as a dimerized soliton train.

Motivation: Cyanobacteria的快速代谢调节对维持能量平衡至关重要，而OpcA蛋白在此过程中起着关键作用。研究者试图找出OpcA的修饰如何调控G6PDH的活性。

Method: 采用了计算建模和实验红细胞化学方法，结合Synechococcus elongatus为模型系统的研究红细胞表面修饰状态。

Result: 实验发现，Thiol修饰的OpcA显著影响了对G6PDH的allosteric相互作用，特别是亮氨酸和亮氨酸导体区以及关键的氢键网络。这些修饰促进了催化活性。

Conclusion: 通过Thiol修饰，OpcA能够调控G6PDH的活性以及结构，从而实现代谢快速适应。这种调节机制为cyanobacteria环境应答提供了关键控制。

Abstract: Cyanobacteria require ultra-fast metabolic switching to maintain reducing
power balance during environmental fluctuations. Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH), catalyzing the rate-limiting step of the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), provides essential NADPH and metabolic
intermediates for biosynthetic processes and redox homeostasis. In
cyanobacteria, the unique redox-sensitive protein OpcA acts as a metabolic
switch for G6PDH, enabling rapid adjustment of reducing power generation from
glycogen catabolism and resulting in precise regulation of carbon flux between
anabolic and catabolic pathways. While the redox-sensitive cysteine structures
of OpcA are known to regulate G6PDH, the detailed mechanisms of how redox
post-translational modifications (PTMs) influence OpcA's allosteric effects on
G6PDH structures and function remain elusive. To investigate this mechanism, we
utilized computational modeling combined with experimental redox proteomics
using Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 as a model system. Redox proteomics
captured modified cysteine residues under light/dark or circadian shifts.
Computational simulation revealed that thiol PTMs near the OpcA-G6PDH interface
are crucial to allosteric regulation of regions affecting the G6PDH activity,
including a potential gate region for substrate ingress and product egress, as
well as critical hydrogen bond networks within the active site. These PTMs
promote rapid metabolic switching by enhancing G6PDH catalytic activity when
OpcA is oxidized. This study provides evidence for novel molecular mechanisms
that elucidate the importance of thiol PTMs of OpcA in modulating G6PDH
structure and function in an allosteric manner, demonstrating how PTM-level
regulation provides a critical control mechanism that enables cyanobacteria to
rapidly adapt to environmental fluctuations through precise metabolic
fine-tuning.

Abstract: We study the motion of a rigid elastic rod, initially set in its relaxed
state along a spacelike geodesic, in an expanding
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. This leads to an initial
boundary value problem (IBVP) for a nonlinear wave equation whose nonlinearity
depends on a parameter $\kappa \geq 0$, related to the ratio between the rod's
length and the cosmological scale. We show that if $\kappa$ is small enough
then the solution to the IBVP is global in time and bounded, meaning that the
rod's length oscillates around its initial value. For greater values of
$\kappa$, however, the solution to the IBVP blows up in finite coordinate time,
indicating that the rod is infinitely stretched by the cosmological expansion.
This supports the widely held belief that sufficiently small bound systems do
not follow the Hubble flow, whereas larger systems may do so. Similar
conclusions apply to the tethered galaxy version of this problem, where the rod
is used to connect two point masses (which results in nonlinear boundary
conditions for the IBVP).

Abstract: We discuss the issue of defining and measuring conical deficits (conicity) in
spacetimes with the torsion singularity such as the Misner string in Taub--NUT
spacetime. We propose a geometric definition that generalizes the standard
notion of conicity to stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with torsion
singularity, where the conical deficit becomes observer-dependent -- it depends
on the choice of a timelike Killing vector. This implies the existence of
observers who perceive no conical singularity along the symmetry axis. As a
result, in any spacetime with a non-vanishing NUT parameter, there are
observers for whom the conicity has the same value on both semi-axes. This
challenges the usual interpretation of conicity differences as indicators of
string/rod-induced acceleration along the axis. We illustrate our definition
across the full Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski class, including the recently
identified accelerated Taub--NUT solution. Our attempts in determining a
canonical observer lead to even less desirable definitions of conicity.

Conclusion: 研究表明，各向异性Bianchi I模型在GR中的观测数据下是一个有效描述宇宙的模型，结合机器学习方法可以提高模型预测精度。通过较大的数据集可以更深入地理解宇宙演化。

Abstract: In the current study, we present the observational data constraints on the
parameters space for an anisotropic cosmological model of Bianchi I type
spacetime in general relativity (GR). For the analysis, we consider
observational datasets of Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
(BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) peak parameters. The
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is utilized to constrain the bestfit
values of the model parameters. For this purpose, we use the publicly available
Python code from CosmoMC and have developed the contour plots with different
constraint limits. For the joint dataset of CC, BAO, and CMBR, the parameter's
best-fit values for the derived model are estimated as H_0 = 69.9\pm 1.4
km/s/Mpc, \Omega_{m0}=0.277^{+0.017}_{-0.015}, \Omega_{\Lambda 0} =
0.722^{+0.015}_{-0.017}, and \Omega_{\sigma 0} = 0.0009\pm0.0001. To estimate
H(z), we explore machine learning (ML) techniques like linear regression,
Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and polynomial regression and thereafter
analyze the results with the theoretically developed H(z) for the proposed
model. Among these ML techniques, the polynomial regression exceeds the
performance compared to other techniques. Further, we also note that larger
dataset provides a better understanding of the cosmological scenario in terms
of ML view point.

Abstract: We introduce a general algebraic decomposition of Riemann-like and Weyl-like
tensors with respect to a non-null vector $u$. We derive Gauss, Codazzi and
Ricci-type identities for the Weyl tensor, that allow to relate the components
of the spacetime Weyl tensor with intrinsic quantities of the hypersurfaces
orthogonal to $u$.
  Restricting to the case of $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes (with $\Lambda \neq 0$
and any dimension) admiting a conformal compactification, we then study the
behaviour of the Weyl tensor near $\mathscr I$ by means of an asymptotic
expansion {\it \`a la} Fefferman-Graham, where the first terms are explicitly
computed. We use these tools to characterize four dimensional algebraically
special spacetimes with locally conformally flat $\mathscr{I}$, showing they
match exactly the so-called {\it Kerr-de Sitter-like class with conformally
flat $\scri$}, thus providing a geometric characterization of this class of
spacetimes.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational wave observations of the GW200105 event provide tighter constraints on alternative theories of gravity, particularly Brans-Dicke, EdGB, and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, with eccentricity improving parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing alternative gravity theories with gravitational wave data helps determine if nature follows general relativity or another theory, especially in extreme conditions.

Method: The study extends eccentric waveform models to analyze GW200105, considering Brans-Dicke, EdGB, and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity models at leading post-Newtonian order.

Result: Including eccentricity allows more accurate parameter estimation and tightens constraints on Brans-Dicke (ω > 3.5), EdGB (α < 2.38 km) gravity, while Chern-Simons remains unconstrained.

Conclusion: Eccentricity in GW signals enhances gravity testing, providing better bounds on certain theories but not others, guiding future research and observations.

Abstract: Direct detections of gravitational waves offer a unique opportunity to test
gravity in the highly dynamical and strong field regime. Current tests are
typically performed assuming signals from quasi-circular binaries. However, the
complex waveform morphology induced by orbital eccentricity can enhance our
ability to probe gravity with greater precision. A recent analysis of the
neutron star-black hole event GW200105 identified strong evidence for orbital
eccentricity. We extend an eccentric-precessing waveform model to test
alternative models with this signal by incorporating eccentric corrections
induced by Brans-Dicke, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet, and dynamical
Chern-Simons gravity at leading post-Newtonian order. We show that analyzing
this event with a quasi-circular model leads to a false deviation from general
relativity, while the inclusion of eccentricity improves the bounds on the
models. Our analysis of GW200105 places tight constraints on
Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, $\alpha^{1/2}_{\text{EdGB}} \lesssim
2.38\,\text{km}$, and Brans-Dicke gravity, $\omega_{\text{BD}} \gtrsim 3.5$,
while dynamical Chern-Simons gravity remains unconstrained due to the low spin
content.

Abstract: This paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of a uniform-density
star in scalar-Einstein-{\AE}ther theory. By applying the Israel junction
conditions explicitly in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to
the gravitational sector, it is shown that a nontrivial scalar profile cannot
be sustained, as it induces a divergence at the stellar center. Since
analytical solutions are unattainable, the background metric is determined
through numerical integration for a few representative configurations. For
axial gravitational perturbations, it is found that the system of equations of
motion cannot be decoupled as long as the {\AE}ther parameter $c_i$ does not
vanish. Subsequently, the dynamics of the system can be simplified to two
coupled equations that describe vector and tensor perturbations with distinct
wave velocities $c_V$ and $c_T$, giving rise to a bimodal system. It is shown
that as the stellar radius is smaller than that of the maximum of the vacuum
Schwarzschild-type effective potential, a potential well is formed, leading to
the emergence of echo phenomenon for the axial gravitational perturbations.
When the stellar radius exceeds the {\it could-have-been} maximum, the
resulting effective potential decreases monotonically, and the wave propagation
is primarily dictated by the discontinuity occurring at the star's surface,
producing a type of more attenuated echo waves. In addition, we explore the
specific properties of the resultant bimodal medium consisting of two degrees
of freedom with distinct sound speeds. However, it is understood that such a
characteristic does not lead to observational implications, and subsequently
hardly offers a potential empirical means to constrain specific metric
parameters of the Einstein-{\AE}ther. We present numerical calculations and
discuss the potential implications of our findings.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are well-motivated candidates for cold dark
matter and may also account for a fraction of the binary black hole mergers
observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. In this study, we investigate
the gravitational-wave signatures of PBHs, with a particular focus on
evaluating their integrated contribution to the stochastic gravitational-wave
background arising from binary mergers over a broad range of redshifts. We
perform a Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave events following all
Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog data, assuming a log-normal PBH mass
function. We compute the merger rate distribution of PBH binaries by accounting
for gravitational torques from the surrounding PBH. To constrain this rate, we
employ the latest limits from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo. Owing to
their primordial origin, PBHs exhibit enhanced merger activity at high
redshifts, prior to the onset of stellar formation. Our analysis yields a
relatively weak inference on the redshift evolution index of the PBH merger
rate, with $\alpha = 2.19^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ at 68\% confidence level. The local
merger rate of PBH binaries is found with posterior estimates lying in the
range $23.5-30.3~\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, reflecting a high degree
of statistical precision in the inferred distribution. Additionally, we
emphasize the potential of stochastic gravitational-wave background
observations to probe the cumulative history of PBH mergers across cosmic time.

Conclusion: 该研究为在量子引力效应下构造无奇性黑洞模型提供了新的思路，并在热力学和宇宙学上有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: The application of nonlinear electrodynamics at high energy scales has led to
a variety of interesting phenomena in recent years, particularly within the
context of non-singular spacetime geometries. Additionally, it is postulated
that gravity near the Planck scale is governed by a minimal cut-off length,
which acts as a renormalization scale against ultraviolet pathologies. Within
this framework, we combine both concepts by introducing modifications to the
electric and matter sectors of a black hole as its size approaches this minimal
length. The result is an electrically charged black hole that is free from
ultraviolet divergences and recovers the Maxwell limit at classical scales. We
further explore the geometric and thermodynamic properties of the resulting
solution within a cosmological anti-de Sitter background, revealing a chemical
analogy with that of a Van der Waals fluid. Subsequently, we examine the
charged black hole in de Sitter space and construct four corresponding
gravitational instantons. We then study their cosmological quantum production
using the formalism of the pair creation rate within the context of the
no-boundary proposal.

Abstract: We explore dark matter phenomenology in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ gravity,
formulated via the vielbein approach in Weitzenb\"{o}ck spacetime. In this
torsion-based extension of gravity, dark matter emerges as a geometric effect
rather than a particle species, with curvature and torsion contributing
dynamically to the field equations. Using recent data -- including SPARC galaxy
rotation curves, Planck CMB observations, and weak lensing from DES and KiDS --
we constrain the model through MCMC analysis. Our results show that, under
specific parameter choices, the theory replicates key cosmological features
without introducing additional dark sector matter. This framework offers a
testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, providing new insight into structure
formation, gravitational lensing, and cosmic acceleration -- all rooted in the
geometry of spacetime.

Abstract: As space exploration extends into cislunar space and further towards Mars,
understanding the relativistic effects on clocks on Mars, particularly in
relation to multibody gravitational influences, becomes increasingly important
for accurate clock synchronization. This study estimates clock rates on Mars
and compares them to those on the Moon and Earth. We find that, on average,
clocks on Mars tick faster than those on the Earth's geoid by 477 microseconds
per day, with a variation of 226 microseconds per day over a Martian year.
Additionally, there is an amplitude modulation of approximately 40 microseconds
per day over seven synodic cycles. We also introduce a formalism for addressing
the effects of solar tides on the Earth-Moon system for predicting clock rates
on the Moon and Mars more accurately when compared to using only Keplerian
orbit approximations. Our analysis quantifies the relativistic proper time
offsets among Martian, lunar, and terrestrial clocks, highlighting important
implications for mission planning and the implementation of timekeeping systems
on Mars.

Abstract: Regular black holes, nonsingular solutions to gravitational collapse with
quantum corrections, offer a compelling alternative to classical black holes
with curvature singularities. In this work, we investigate how the presence of
skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of
regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such
objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective
potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections,
allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark
matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces
shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of
perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations:
scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal
mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases,
altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor
field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles,
revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics. These
results provide a theoretical framework for probing regular black holes in the
dark matter environment through gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: Recent observational evidences point out towards a late time acceleration of
the universe. In order to study the accelerated expansion, scientists have
incorporated the existence of an exotic matter with negative pressure, termed
as dark energy. Afterwards a new idea of dark energy have been studied
depending on the holographic principle of quantum gravity, called as the
Holographic Dark Energy(HDE). Later on modifying Bekestein-Hawking entropy,
different generalized entropies have been proposed, one of them being R\'enyi
entropy which leads to R\'enyi holographic dark energy model (RHDE). We have
considered RHDE model with Hubble horizon as the IR cut off and have studied
the cosmological behaviour under non interacting, linear and non-linear
interacting scenarios with the help of dynamical systems analysis. We have also
investigated the stability of the system around hyperbolic critical points
along with the type of fluid description, evolution of equation of state
parameter as well as matter and energy density parameters.

Abstract: The orbital evolution of binary black hole (BBH) systems is determined by the
component masses and spins of the black holes and the governing gravity theory.
Gravitational wave (GW) signals from the evolution of BBH orbits offer an
unparalleled opportunity for examining the predictions of General Relativity
(GR) and for searching for missing physics in the current waveform models. We
present a method of stacking up the time-frequency pixel energies through the
orbital frequency evolution with the flexibility of gradually shifting the
orbital frequency curve along the frequency axis. We observe a distinct energy
peak corresponding to the GW signal's quadrupole mode. If an alternative theory
of gravity is considered and the analysis of the BBH orbital evolution is
executed following GR, the energy distribution on the time-frequency plane will
be significantly different. We propose a new consistency test to check whether
our theoretical waveform explains the BBH orbital evolution. Through the
numerical simulation of beyond-GR theory of gravity and utilizing the framework
of second-generation interferometers, we demonstrate the efficiency of this new
method in detecting any possible departure from GR. Finally, when applied to an
eccentric BBH system and GW190814, which shows the signatures of higher-order
multipoles, our method provides an exquisite probe of missing physics in the GR
waveform models.

Result: 论文结果显示，在不同的度量下，比如Simpson-Visser和Reissner-Nordström时空，吸积速率、声临界点位置以及系统亮度都有显著差异，尤其受限于ℓ的正则化参数和流体模型。通过引入正则化参数ℓ，可以在吸积半径位置提供双重调整的可能性，尤其是在吸etrac物电情况下的双影响。同样，指数流体相较于绝热流体在远处表现出不同的轨道趋势。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入Simpson-Visser时空和不同的流体模型，分析了相对论性吸ptron的多重行为。结果表明，在不同参数值及流体情况下，吸ptron的声临界点位置、吸积速率和亮度表现出显著差异，且这些特性可能通过观测进行双重确认。特别是在正则化参数ℓ、中心电荷Q和流体类型之间存在多重调整的可能性，为观察提供了一种多标尺的方法。

Abstract: We investigate relativistic Bondi accretion in the Simpson-Visser spacetime,
which, via a single parameter $\ell$, interpolates between the Schwarzschild,
regular black hole, extremal and wormhole regimes. First, we analyze the
neutral Simpson-Visser geometry, recovering Schwarzschild at $\ell=0$, and then
its charged extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric. In both these cases,
we derive the conservation equations and analyze two representative fluid
models: a barotropic perfect fluid and a constituent with an exponential
density profile. By varying the parameters across regimes, we locate critical
(sonic) points and integrate velocity, density and pressure profiles. While
near-horizon inflow velocities are similar across the different solutions, we
find that the critical radius and the resulting accretion rates and
luminosities severely change, depending on the value of the parameter and type
of fluid. Remarkably, the barotropic and exponential cases exhibit different
trends in the outer regions. Moreover, by extending the analysis to the charged
SV spacetime, we find that the presence of a central charge $Q$ produces
additional, albeit modest, shifts in the sonic radius which, in combination
with those induced by the regularization parameter $\ell$, could provide a
double observational marker. In particular, while $\ell$ acts predominantly on
the position of the critical point, in the barotropic fluid case, the
electromagnetic contribution of $Q$ slightly dampens the inflow velocity near
the horizon.

*Adrien Bourgoin,Pascale Defraigne,Frédéric Meynadier*

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges and considerations for establishing a relativistic lunar reference frame, evaluating different time scales and their relevance to future lunar missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a precise lunar reference frame arises from planned exploration missions to the Moon. Current methods rely on general relativity but lack detailed analysis of specific relativistic effects like gravitational redshift and time transformations between lunar and terrestrial clocks.

Method: The paper reviews the orders of magnitude of relativistic effects, such as gravitational redshift on the Moon's surface and time transformations between Lunar and Earth clocks. It then assesses potential options for a lunar reference timescale, comparing their advantages and drawbacks.

Result: The analysis provides a clear understanding of the magnitude of relativistic effects on the Moon, offering insights into the most suitable reference timescale for lunar missions. The findings contribute to improving the accuracy of lunar timekeeping and synchronization with UTC.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenge of setting up a relativistic lunar reference frame, providing practical recommendations and a thorough evaluation of the most promising options for a lunar reference timescale, which is crucial for the success of future lunar exploration missions.

Abstract: Setting up a relativistic lunar reference frame is of a prime importance in
the context of future exploration missions to the Moon. If the procedure for
building a consistent reference frame within the framework of the general
theory of relativity is well established (cf. resolutions B.3 of IAU 2000),
there is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be
adopted as reference in the cislunar region. In this paper, we review the
orders of magnitude of the relativistic effects resulting from (i) the
gravitational redshift of a clock on the lunar surface and (ii) the time
transformations between a clock on the surface of the Moon and a clock on the
surface of the Earth. We then discuss possible options for a lunar reference
timescale with their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we propose possible
realizations of the lunar reference timescale as well as its traceability to
UTC.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the universal extremality relation and
thermodynamic topology of Van der Waals (VdW) black holes-solutions of
Einstein's equations whose thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of Van
der Waals fluids. In the classical case, the black hole entropy obeys the
Bekenstein-Hawking area law and satisfies the standard universality relation.
We then incorporate quantum corrections using three distinct frameworks: the
Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the Extended Uncertainty Principle
(EUP), and Rainbow Gravity. While these corrections modify the entropy law, we
find that a generalized form of the universal extremality relation still holds.
Next, we explore the thermodynamic topology of VdW black holes, focusing on the
distribution of topological charges. Our analysis reveals that variations in
the black hole and model parameters lead to significant changes in topological
classifications and stability, as quantified by winding numbers. In the
GUP-corrected case, topological charge distributions exhibit robustness against
parameter variations, suggesting classification stability. For EUP-corrected
black holes, we identify two distinct topological classes, with some
configurations displaying three non-zero topological charges and others
maintaining a total charge of zero, despite changes in individual charge
counts. The Rainbow Gravity-corrected scenario shows similar consistency in
topological behavior.

Abstract: Recently, a class of exact solutions describing rotating black holes immersed
in a uniform magnetic field has been proposed, and various properties of such
black holes remain unclear. This paper aims to explore how to extract energy
based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism in both the circular orbit region
and the plunging region. After introducing the properties of this spacetime, we
analyze physical quantities such as the size of the ergoregion, the event
horizon, and the boundaries of the ergosphere. We then analyze the magnetic
reconnection process within circular orbits. We plot energy extraction
parameter diagrams, and analyze the power and efficiency of energy extraction.
The results show that the magnetic field impedes energy extraction. Comparing
with Kerr black holes and Kerr-Melvin black holes, we find that this black
hole's energy extraction capability is stronger than that of the Kerr-Melvin
black hole but weaker than that of the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we study
magnetic reconnection and energy extraction in the plunging region of this
black hole. The results indicate that the magnetic field still impedes energy
extraction. The black hole's energy extraction capability in this region also
remains weaker than that of a Kerr black hole but stronger than that of a
Kerr-Melvin black hole. Comparing the plunging region with the circular orbit
region, we find that the energy extraction power in the plunging region is
consistently stronger than in the circular orbit region.

Abstract: Current models of quantum interference experiments in external gravitational
fields lack a common framework: while matter-wave interferometers are commonly
described using the Schr\"odinger equation with a Newtonian potential,
gravitational effects in quantum optics are modeled using either post-Newtonian
metrics or highly symmetric exact solutions to Einstein's field equations such
as those of Schwarzschild and Kerr. To coherently describe both kinds of
experiments, this paper develops a unified framework for modeling quantum
interferometers in general stationary space-times. This model provides a

Abstract: In this work, we extend the effective potential method to dynamical
spacetimes by introducing a novel concept of dynamical potential and
establishing three fundamental conditions that govern the evolution of circular
orbits in such spacetimes. By generalizing the framework from static to
dynamical spacetimes, we propose three conditions for the evolution equation of
circular orbits: (1) The orbital radius of the evolving circular orbits does
not explicitly depend on the affine parameter; (2) the dynamical potential does
not change along the evolving circular orbits; and (3) the angular momentum of
the evolving circular orbits is conserved. The dynamical potential conditions
yield evolution equations for circular orbits that are shown to be equivalent
to the quasi-local method. This approach provides a unified framework for
analyzing orbital dynamics in time-dependent gravitational fields, with direct
implications for black hole dynamics. The results bridge traditional effective
potential methods with dynamical spacetime studies, enhancing the tools
available for probing black hole mergers and evolving relativistic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand perturbation effects in modified gravity theories, specifically quadratic gravity, building on classical results in general relativity.

Method: The authors employ the Newman-Penrose formalism and the Teukolsky approach, linearizing field equations and combining them with Ricci and Bianchi identities to derive constraints on perturbations.

Result: By decoupling the equations, the solution is determined by Ricci tensor perturbations on the Kerr background in quadratic gravity, with examples given in Schwarzschild and Minkowski spacetimes.

Conclusion: This work extends the study of perturbed spacetimes to quadratic gravity, offering a method to fully determine solutions with fewer unknowns.

Abstract: Employing the Newman-Penrose formalism and following the classic
Teukolsky-like approach, we linearise the field equations of quadratic gravity
on the Kerr background and combine them with the linearised Ricci and Bianch
identities. This leads to constraints on linear perturbations of the Kerr
spacetime in quadratic gravity. The resulting differential equations are
decoupled in such a way that only the Ricci tensor perturbations need to be
found on the Kerr background in order to fully determine the solution. The
results are illustrated in the simple non-trivial cases of the Schwarzschild
and Minkowski geometries.

Abstract: We investigate the spherical accretion of various types of fluids onto a
Schwarzschild-like black hole solution modified by a Kalb-Ramond field
implementing spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation (LV). The system is
analyzed for isothermal fluids characterized by the equation of state
$p=\omega\rho$, including ultra-stiff, ultra-relativistic, and radiation
fluids. We investigate the effect of the LV parameter $l$ on the fluid density
$\rho(r)$, radial velocity $u(r)$, and accretion rate $\dot{M}$. Using a
Hamiltonian dynamical systems approach, we examine the behavior near critical
points and identify the sonic transitions in each scenario. Our results show
that the LV parameter influences the location of critical points, the flow
structure, and the accretion rate, with $l>0$ ($l<0$) enhancing (suppressing)
the latter. For ultra-stiff fluids, no critical points are found, and the flow
remains entirely subsonic. For ultra-relativistic and radiation fluids,
transonic solutions exist, with the position of the sonic point depending on
the sign of $l$. We also analyze polytropic fluids $p=\mathcal{K}
\rho^{\Gamma}$ with $\Gamma=5/3$ and $\Gamma=4/3$, observing similar
qualitative behavior, where the sonic transition is affected by both the
equation of state and the LV parameter. These findings suggest that Lorentz
symmetry breaking can significantly alter accretion dynamics in black hole
spacetimes.

### [90] [Inverse scattering method for an integrable system of derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21148)
*Mehmet Unlu*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a solution method for the derivative nonlinear Schrödinger II system, known as the Chen-Lee-Liu system, using the inverse scattering transform (IST) with a Marchenko system. They solve the inverse scattering problem using transmission and reflection coefficients along with bound-state information, inputting this into a Marchenko integral equation to recover the potentials. Time evolution is included, and the solutions evolve nonlinearly, preserving the structure of the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is likely of interest to those studying soliton equations and integrable systems. The Derivative Nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation is important in modeling various physical phenomena, such as optical solitons. The Chen-Lee-Liu system is another form of DNLS, and solving it using IST offers a powerful method for analyzing and predicting solutions, making this paper potentially valuable for both theoretical and applied contexts.

Method: The authors employ the inverse scattering transform approach, which involves solving the Marchenko integral equations. They construct a Marchenko system using transmission and reflection coefficients along with bound-state data, then solve this system to retrieve the potentials. The potentials' time evolution is determined to solve the integrable DNLS II system.

Result: They successfully develop a method to solve the Chen-Lee-Liu system by transforming into a Marchenko system, yielding potentials and their time evolution that satisfy the DNLS II equations. The approach leverages scattering data and ensures solution recovery via this integral equation system.

Conclusion: The authors present a systematic solution technique for the DNLS II system using inverse scattering, which likely contributes to the general understanding of integrable systems and their solutions, possibly offering new insights or methodological advancements in solving such nonlinear equations.

Abstract: We present a solution method for the integrable system (derivative nonlinear
Schr\"odinger II system) or the Chen--Lee--Liu system. This is done by
presenting a solution technique for the inverse scattering problem for the
corresponding linear system of ordinary differential equations with
energy-dependent potentials. The relevant inverse scattering problem is solved
by establishing a system of linear integral equations, which we refer to as the
Marchenko system of linear integral equations. In solving the inverse
scattering problem we use the input data set consisting of a transmission
coefficient, a reflection coefficient, and the bound-state information
presented in the form of a pair of matrix triplets. Using our data set as input
to the Marchenko system, we recover the potentials from the solution to the
Marchenko system. By using the time-evolved input data set, we recover the
time-evolved potentials, where those potentials form a solution to the
integrable DNLS II system.

TL;DR: The paper constructs Darboux matrices and derives integrable models for non-Abelian derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equations, introducing non-commutative constants. It demonstrates that linear Darboux matrices lead to Volterra-type equations while quadratic ones yield systems like the Ablowitz-Ladik, Merola-Ragnisco-Tu, and relativistic Toda equations. Necessary conditions for factorizing higher-degree Darboux polynomials using linear matrices are provided using quasideterminants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is likely relevant to researchers studying integrable systems, especially those dealing with non-Abelian equations and Darboux transformations. The introduction of non-commutative constants might have applications in mathematical physics or applied mathematics.

Method: The methods used appear to involve constructing compatible Darboux matrices, employing reduction groups associated with Lax operators, and using quasideterminants for factorization conditions.

Result: The paper presents new integrable systems, demonstrates transformation outcomes from linear to quadratic Darboux matrices, and provides factorization conditions using quasideterminants.

Conclusion: The work contributes new integrable models with non-commutative constants and offers methods for factorizing Darboux polynomials, expanding the toolkit for studying non-Abelian integrable systems.

Abstract: We construct linear and quadratic Darboux matrices compatible with the
reduction group of the Lax operator for each of the seven known non-Abelian
derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations that admit Lax representations.
The differential-difference systems derived from these Darboux transformations
generalise established non-Abelian integrable models by incorporating
non-commutative constants. Specifically, we demonstrate that linear Darboux
transformations generate non-Abelian Volterra-type equations, while quadratic
transformations yield two-component systems, including non-Abelian versions of
the Ablowitz-Ladik, Merola-Ragnisco-Tu, and relativistic Toda equations. Using
quasideterminants, we establish necessary conditions for factorising a
higher-degree polynomial Darboux matrix with a specific linear Darboux matrix
as a factor. This result enables the factorisation of quadratic Darboux
matrices into pairs of linear Darboux matrices.

Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are key bioelectronic devices,
with applications in neuromorphics, sensing, and flexible electronics. However,
their microfabrication typically relies on precious metal contacts manufactured
via cleanroom processes. Here, we present a high-throughput
additive-subtractive microfabrication strategy for metal-free, flexible OECTs
using biodegradable materials and room-temperature processing. Additive
manufacturing of large features is achieved via extrusion printing of a
water-dispersed graphene ink to fabricate electrode contacts, and spin-coating
of a cellulose acetate ink to form both the substrate and encapsulation layer.
Combined with femtosecond laser ablation, this approach enables
micrometer-resolution patterning of free-standing OECTs with channel openings
down to 1 um and sheet resistance below 10 Ohm/sq. By tuning laser parameters,
we demonstrate both selective and simultaneous ablation strategies, enabling
the fabrication horizontal, vertical, and planar-gated OECTs, as well as
complementary NOT gate inverters. Thermal degradation studies in air show that
over 80% of the device mass decomposes below 360 deg C, providing a low-energy
route for device disposal and addressing the environmental impact of electronic
waste. This approach offers a cleanroom-free and lithography-free pathway
toward the rapid prototyping of high-resolution, sustainable organic
electronics, combining material circularity, process simplicity, and
architectural versatility for next-generation bioelectronic applications.

Abstract: The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment
remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards
its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with
improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments
rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors,
which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic
radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D
project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is
read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon
detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark
noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at
cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed
cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the
detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first
experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large
area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a
preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising,
also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and
the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the
sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation
PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this
technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale
experiments.

nonlinearities. In this context, normal-dispersion Kerr microcombs are
critically needed because of their standout advantages, yet this dispersion
regime remains unexplored for comb generation on X-cut TFLN. Here, we leverage
ultralow-loss photonic waveguides, as well as strategic resonator designs that
allow us to tailor Raman effects and engineer desired spatial mode
interactions, for the robust generation of normal-dispersion Kerr microcombs.
Specifically, we show microcombs that substantially surpass state-of-the-art
bright cavity soliton and EO microcombs on X-cut TFLN in key performance
metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel microcomb whose existence is
underpinned by both normal-dispersion Kerr dynamics and stimulated Raman
scattering, in a single spatial mode of a microresonator. This microcomb
manifests itself as two interleaved frequency combs centered about the pump and
Stokes frequencies, resulting in extended spectral spans. Our work will unlock
high-speed and low energy consumption photonic circuits for communications,
frequency synthesis, and signal processing enabled by a monolithic microcomb
technology, while also stimulating further investigations of new nonlinear
states that may synergize the strong hybrid nonlinearities unique to X-cut
TFLN.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种直接利用双波长不对准数字化光栅显微镜方法，用于直接相位差重建，无需分别对每个波长的相位图像进行重建。通过钠灯光源获取两个接近的波长（λ₁=589 nm，λ₂=589.6 nm），并利用Michelson干涉配置获得578.8 μm的合成波长。通过与单波长方法相位解包裹结果对比，验证了该方法的有效性。具体应用中，测量了一个30 μm的高阶梯样本和140 μm厚的玻璃 plates，展示了该方法对高阶梯样品的成像能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光栅显微镜在材料表征和表面工程领域具有广泛的应用，尤其在测量样品高阶梯结构等方面。然而，现有的复相位重建方法通常需要分别对每个波长进行相位重建，过程繁琐，且可能导致测量误差积累。因此，寻找一种高效、精确且无需单独重建相位的方法就成了亟待解决的问题。

Abstract: A method for direct phase difference reconstruction using single-shot
dual-wavelength off-axis digital holography is presented. This approach enables
direct imaging of samples with high steps without the need to reconstruct phase
images at each individual wavelength. As the dual wavelengths in the reference
and object arms pass through a common path in this configuration,
single-wavelength arrangements can be applied. Due to the unique capability of
the presented method, a sodium-vapor lamp source has been utilized to obtain
two closely spaced wavelengths (${\lambda}1 = 589 nm$ and ${\lambda}2 = 589.6
nm$), with in a synthetic wavelength of ${\Lambda} = 578.8 \mu m$ in the
Michelson configuration. To evaluate the validity of the method, the height of
an air wedge measured using the proposed approach has been compared with the
result obtained from phase unwrapping in the single-wavelength method. The
capability of the proposed technique to image samples with high step structures
is further demonstrated by measuring a $30 \mu m$ step height and a glass plate
with a thickness of approximately $140 \mu m$.

Abstract: Among the organic semiconductors, rubrene stands out in terms of hole
mobility, luminescence yield and exciton migration distance. A novel type of
rubrene microcrystal is prepared in the orthorhombic phase, exhibiting
zone-sectored tabular domains with distinct photoluminescence (PL)
characteristics. These sectors exhibit distinct PL spectra and time-evolution,
arising from differences in the in-plane orientation of the orthorhombic unit
cell relative to the crystal surface. A combination of polarised optical
microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) is used to characterise the samples in terms of crystal
orientation, fluorescence lifetime, and photoluminescence spectra. Spatially
resolved PL spectroscopy reveals that the redshifted 650 nm emission band has
polarisation along the transition dipole moment and is associated with high
photon absorption due to the alignment of excitation polarisation and
transition dipole moment and selectively localized within specific sectors of
the crystal. The detected photon originates from direct emission of a geminate
coherent triplet pair, or from its fusion. This band exhibits pure
mono-exponential dynamics with 3.7 ns lifetime. The triplet fusion behaviour in
the succeeding time regimes can be treated in the framework of power law
scaling and random walk. The emission kinetics are modelled using rate
equations describing geminate and non-geminate exciton fusion processes,
enabling a quantitative interpretation of the spatially resolved PL kinetics.
These findings introduce a material-based strategy, opening novel routes for
photonic applications and light harvesting.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) microscopy
have focused on sensor and system improvements, yet sample processing remains
overlooked. We conducted an analysis of the literature, revealing that 40
percent of studies do not report sample thickness. Among those that did report
it, the vast majority, 98 percent, used 2 to 10 micrometer samples. This study
investigates the impact of unstained sample thickness on MS/HS image quality
through light transport simulations. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted on
various tissue types (i.e., breast, colorectal, liver, and lung). The
simulations revealed that thin samples reduce tissue differentiation, while
higher thicknesses (approximately 500 micrometers) improve discrimination,
though at the cost of reduced light intensity. These findings highlight the
need to study and optimize sample thickness for enhanced tissue
characterization and diagnostic accuracy in MS/HS microscopy.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates using Restormer to correct aberrations in hyperbolic metalenses for high-quality imaging across a wide field-of-view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ultrathin nature and high focusing efficiency of hyperbolic metalenses make them ideal for sensing and imaging, but their off-axis aberrations limit their field-of-view. The paper addresses this challenge by using a neural network to correct the aberrations, enabling wide FOV imaging.

Method: The study employs a Restormer neural network. The network is trained using simulated spatially-varying blurred images generated by the eigen-point-spread function (eigenPSF) method, avoiding the need for experimental data.

Result: The proposed method successfully corrects aberrations, allowing the hyperbolic metalens camera to achieve a 54-degree wide FOV, outperforming traditional imaging techniques under various lighting conditions.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for the practical application of hyperbolic metalenses in real-world imaging systems, paving the way for advanced sensing and imaging technologies.

Abstract: The ultrathin form factor of metalenses makes them highly appealing for novel
sensing and imaging applications. Amongst the various phase profiles, the
hyperbolic metalens stands out for being free from spherical aberrations and
having one of the highest focusing efficiencies to date. For imaging, however,
hyperbolic metalenses present significant off-axis aberrations, severely
restricting the achievable field-of-view (FOV). Extending the FOV of hyperbolic
metalenses is thus feasible only if these aberrations can be corrected. Here,
we demonstrate that a Restormer neural network can be used to correct these
severe off-axis aberrations, enabling wide FOV imaging with a hyperbolic
metalens camera. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of training the
Restormer network purely on simulated datasets of spatially-varying blurred
images generated by the eigen-point-spread function (eigenPSF) method,
eliminating the need for time-intensive experimental data collection. This
reference-free training ensures that Restormer learns solely to correct optical
aberrations, resulting in reconstructions that are faithful to the original
scene. Using this method, we show that a hyperbolic metalens camera can be used
to obtain high-quality imaging over a wide FOV of 54{\deg} in experimentally
captured scenes under diverse lighting conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is to understand optical limiting effects, which are crucial for protecting eyes and sensors. The research provides insights into nonlinear optical responses in organic semiconductors, aiding in the design of materials.

Method: The study uses ab initio, real-time time-dependent density-functional theory to analyze the absorption spectra of thiophene oligomers. They focused on the effects of electric fields and excited states.

Result: Excited-state absorption is identified as the key mechanism causing optical limiting in the oligothiophene molecules. Population dynamics experiments support this, indicating the near-infrared to visible region absorption.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights into OL mechanisms, suggesting that optimizing excited-state absorption could improve nonlinear optical characteristics in organic semiconductors. This knowledge is essential for designing advanced materials.

Abstract: Optical limiting (OL), a crucial mechanism for protecting human eyes and
sensitive sensors from intense radiation, relies on understanding the optical
nonlinearities acting on the systems. Assessing and disentangling the effects
at play is crucial to predict and control the nonlinear optical response in
real materials. In this ab initio study based on real-time time-dependent
density-functional theory, we investigate non-perturbatively the absorption
spectra of a set of thiophene oligomers, the building blocks of technologically
relevant organic semiconductors, excited by broadband radiation of increasing
intensity. Under strong electric fields, the absorption cross section grows
significantly below the onset of linear excitations, exhibiting saturation
typical of OL. By exciting the oligothiophenes with a train of pulses targeting
the first and second excited states of each moiety and analyzing the resulting
population dynamics, we reveal excited-state absorption (ESA) in the
near-infrared to visible region. Our results indicate ESA as the driving
mechanism for OL in oligothiophene molecules, thereby providing important
insight to design novel compounds with optimized nonlinear optical
characteristics.

Abstract: Electro-optic (EO) frequency combs are foundational for metrology and
spectroscopy. Specifically, microresonator-based cavity EO combs are
distinguished by efficient sideband generation, precisely controlled by
microwave signals, enabling high-performance integrated frequency references
and pulse sources. However, the apparent simplicity of these devices, often
described by the EO modulation-induced coupling of nearest-neighbor cavity
modes, has limited investigations of their fundamental physics, thereby
restricting their full potential. Here, we uncover the universal dynamics and
complete frequency lattice connectivity underpinning cavity EO microcombs, as
well as characterize the full space of nonlinear optical states, controlled by
modulation depth and optical detuning, using the thin-film lithium niobate
photonic platform. Leveraging this understanding, we design complex long-range
couplings between cavity modes to realize programmable spectro-temporal shaping
of the generated combs and pulses. We achieve three technological advances,
including repetition-rate flexibility, substantial comb bandwidth extension
beyond traditional scaling laws, and resonantly-enhanced flat-top spectrum. Our
results provide physical insights for synchronously driven cavity-based EO

Abstract: Cavity electro-optic (EO) modulation plays a pivotal role in optical pulse
and frequency comb synthesis, supporting a wide range of applications including
communication, computing, ranging, and quantum information. The ever-growing
demand for these applications has driven efforts in enhancing modulation
coupling strength and bandwidth towards advanced pulse-comb synthesis. However,
the effects of strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity EO modulation remain
underexplored, due to the lack of a general, unified model that captures this
extreme condition. In this work, we present a universal framework for
pulse-comb synthesis under cavity EO modulation, where coupling strength and
modulation bandwidth far exceed the cavity's free spectral range (FSR). We show
that, under such intense and ultrafast driving conditions, EO-driven frequency
combs and pulses exhibit rich higher-order nonlinear dynamics, including
temporal pulse compression and comb generation with arbitrary pump detuning.
Leveraging this framework, we reveal a direct link between the higher-order
dynamics of EO pulse-comb generation and the band structure of synthetic
dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate arbitrary comb shaping via
machine-learning-based inverse microwave drive design, achieving a tenfold
enhancement in cavity electro-optic comb flatness by exploring the synergistic
effects of high-bandwidth driving and detuning-induced frequency boundaries.
Our findings push cavity electro-optic modulation into a new frontier,
unlocking significant potential for universal and machine-learning-programmable
electro-optic frequency combs, topological photonics, as well as photonic
quantum computing in the strong-coupling and high-bandwidth regimes.

TL;DR: The study introduces DCCL-WPT systems as safe and efficient solutions for intracavity laser-based applications, with validated safety parameters in various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety is paramount in intracavity systems for communication, positioning, and WPT applications. There is a need to validate the safety metrics of DCCL-WPT systems under different scenarios.

Method: The study models irradiation on intruding objects, evaluates eye exposure using a human head model, and performs ray tracing simulations to assess cornea and retina risks.

Result: DCCL-WPT systems achieve over 600 mW charging power while maintaining skin and eye safety. Intruding objects experience significantly lower irradiance. These findings support the practical deployment of DCCL-WPT systems for safe energy transfer.

Conclusion: DCCL-WPT systems are viable for applications requiring safety and efficiency, with scalable solutions for hazard mitigation through design optimization.

Abstract: Intracavity laser-based systems are emerging as key enablers for
next-generation wireless communications, positioning, and wireless power
transfer (WPT). Distributed coupled-cavity laser (DCCL) systems, as a
representative configuration, have been proposed to expand the field of view
(FoV) and enhance safety. This paper investigates the safety assessment of
DCCL-WPT systems through three case studies: skin safety, eye safety, and
small-object intrusion sensitivity. First, we establish a safety analysis model
to quantify irradiation levels on intruding objects in the beam path, which
simulates intracavity beam propagation using diffraction modeling and gain-loss
dynamics under case-specific boundary conditions. Next, we formulate an eye
safety evaluation tailored for DCCL-WPT systems using a human head model to
identify potential exposure angles and distances. Ray tracing confirms that
intracavity beams are not focused onto the retina, making cornea exposure the
primary consideration (irradiance is below 0.1 W/cm2). Numerical results
demonstrate that DCCL-WPT achieves: i) over 600 mW charging power under
skin-safe conditions at 5 m distance (100 mW over 16{\deg} FoV), and nearly 50%
lower irradiance on intruding objects compared to single-cavity systems; ii)
150 mW charging power under eye-safe conditions with 650 mW 1064 nm output beam
power, far beyond the typical ~10 mW eye-safe threshold; iii) high sensitivity
to small-object intrusion, enabling hazard mitigation. These findings
underscore the practicality of DCCL-WPT systems for mobile, long-distance, and
safe energy transfer, and lay the groundwork for future safety-aware
optimizations in real-world deployments.

Motivation: Q开关激光器虽具有紧凑、经济和可调节脉冲能量的优势，但其 narrow bandwidth限制了其在需要超短脉冲应用中的适用性，与mode-locked lasers相比难以满足某些领域的需求。因此，寻找一种有效压缩这些长脉冲的方法具有重要的研究价值。

Method: 研究利用Herriott型多光程胞后的压缩方法，首先在实验中使用玻璃棒多光程胞将0.5纳秒、1毫焦耳的脉冲压缩到24皮秒，随后通过数值模拟验证了这一压缩效果，并指出使用纳米多光程胞可能进一步压缩脉冲至几皮秒。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的超短脉冲压缩方法，为应用Q开关激光器在需要超短脉冲的领域提供了技术方案。

Abstract: Q-switched lasers are compact, cost-effective, and highly pulse
energy-scalable sources for nanosecond-scale laser pulses. The technology has
been developed for many decades and is widely used in scientific, industrial
and medical applications. However, their inherently narrow bandwidth imposes a
lower limit on pulse duration - typically in the few-hundred-picosecond range -
limiting the applicability of Q-switched technology in fields that require
ultrafast laser pulses in the few-picosecond or femtosecond regime. In
contrast, mode-locked lasers can produce broad-band, ultrafast (< 1 ps) pulses,
but are complex, expensive, and typically require a large footprint. To bridge
the parameter gap between these two laser platforms - in terms of pulse
duration and achievable peak power - we here propose a Herriott-type multi-pass
cell (MPC) based post-compression scheme for shortening the pulse durations of
Q-switched lasers down to the ultrafast, picosecond regime. We experimentally
demonstrate post-compression of 0.5 ns, 1 mJ pulses from a Q-switched laser to
24 ps using a compact glass-rod MPC for spectral broadening. We verify this
result numerically and show that compression down to a few picoseconds is
possible using the nanosecond MPC (nMPC).

TL;DR: The paper discusses the monolithic integration of quantum and classical electronics using spin qubits in silicon quantum dots, achieving high yield, reduced variability, and demonstrating scalability with advanced CMOS technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing number of qubits in quantum processors presents challenges in scaling, such as device variability and cryogenic integration. This paper aims to address these issues through the integration of quantum dots with classical electronics.

Method: The authors developed a fabrication process using 22-nm FDSOI CMOS technology, integrating 384 p-type quantum dots into silicon transistors. They employed fast readout and machine learning for analyzing quantum dot parameters.

Result: The chip operation at deep cryogenic temperatures showed high yield, reduced device variability, and low charge noise.

Conclusion: The demonstrated integration validates scalability, opening new paths for quantum computing integration.

Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum processors have recently grown to reach 100s of
physical qubits. As the number of qubits continues to grow, new challenges
associated with scaling arise, such as device variability reduction and
integration with cryogenic electronics for I/O management. Spin qubits in
silicon quantum dots provide a platform where these problems may be mitigated,
having demonstrated high control and readout fidelities and compatibility with
large-scale manufacturing techniques of the semiconductor industry. Here, we
demonstrate the monolithic integration of 384 p-type quantum dots, each
embedded in a silicon transistor, with on-chip digital and analog electronics,
all operating at deep cryogenic temperatures. The chip is fabricated using
22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS technology. We extract
key quantum dot parameters by fast readout and automated machine learning
routines to determine the link between device dimensions and quantum dot yield,
variability, and charge noise figures. Overall, our results demonstrate a path
to monolithic integration of quantum and classical electronics at scale.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study uses perturbation theory in the thin cylinder limit to analyze excitations in the ν=1/3 FQHE, finding neutral excitations with dispersion and charged ones with a narrow energy range. Includes connections to composite fermion theory and proposes explanations for experiments.*size:4,language:en,model:default,status:valid,wrap:atom,timestamp:KHmenu,api-key:None,


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the excitations of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states, which are challenging to detect experimentally. The authors propose using electron scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and perturbation theory in the thin cylinder limit to study low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the ν=1/3 FQHE state. The methodology involves establishing a mapping to a 1D lattice Hamiltonian and applying perturbation theory to systematically enumerate excitations based on dipole patterns. The key results include dispersive neutral excitations and a narrow energy range for charged excitations, along with connections to composite fermion theory. The conclusion suggests implications for experimental observations.

Method: The authors employ perturbation theory within the thin cylinder limit, leveraging a mapping to a 1D lattice Hamiltonian, to systematically analyze the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the ν=1/3 FQHE state. By considering the electron occupations and their dipole formation patterns, they develop a framework to predict the dispersion and energy characteristics of these excitations. The study also explores connections to composite fermion theory, providing a theoretical bridge between different approaches to understanding FQHE excitations.

Result: The research identifies significant dispersion in the low-lying neutral excitations and a narrow energy range for charged excitations. Employing numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit supports the idea that charged excitations exhibit confined energy levels, which could explain experimental observations. The framework incorporates dipole patterns and connects with composite fermion theory, offering a comprehensive approach to interpreting FQHE STM spectra.

Conclusion: The paper presents a theoretical framework using perturbation theory and a 1D lattice model to analyze FQHE excitations on a torus, particularly the ν=1/3 state. By considering dipole formations, the authors detail the dispersion of neutral excitations and the sharpness of charged excitations' peaks. This approach bridges composite fermion theory and experimental STM observations, enhancing understanding of FQHE excitations.

Abstract: The excitations of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states have been
largely inaccessible to experimental probes until recently. New electron
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results from Hu et.al. (2023) show promise
in detecting and identifying these excited states via the local density of
states (LDOS) spectrum. On a torus, there exists a mapping to a 1D lattice
Hamiltonian with center-of-mass or dipole moment conservation. In this work, we
apply perturbation theory starting from the thin cylinder limit ($L_x
\rightarrow \infty, L_y <l_B$ for torus dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$) to obtain
an analytical approach to the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the
$\nu =1/3$ FQHE state. Notably, in the thin cylinder we can systematically
enumerate all the low-lying excitations by the patterns of 'dipoles' formed by
the electron occupation pattern on the 1D lattice. We find that the
thin-cylinder limit predicts a significant dispersion of the low-lying neutral
excitations but sharpness of the LDOS spectra, which measure charged
excitations. We also discuss connections between our work and several different
approaches to the FQHE STM spectra, including those using the composite fermion
theory. Numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit suggests
that the energies of charged excitations remain largely confined to a narrow
range of energies, which in experiments might appear as a single peak.

Abstract: Fractional topological phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall state,
usually rely on strong interactions to generate ground state degeneracy with
gap protection and fractionalized topological response. Here, we propose a
fractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is
driven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different
from the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional
topological phases. A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands
drives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may
hybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space
energy gap (RSEG). Unlike the integer topological band insulator obtained in
the weak linear potential regime without closing the original bulk gap, the
fractional topological Stark insulating phase is resulted from the RSEG when
the linear potential gradient exceeds a critical value. We develop a
theoretical formalism to characterize the fractional topological Stark
insulator, and further show that the many-body state under topological pumping
returns to the initial state only after multiple $2\pi$ periods of evolution,
giving the fractional charge pumping, similar to that in fractional quantum
Hall state. Finally, we propose how to realize the fractional topological Stark
insulator in real experiment.

Abstract: The integration of 2D materials with artificially textured substrates offers
exceptional opportunities for engineering novel functional devices. A
straightforward technological route towards such devices is a mechanical dry or
wet transfer of 2D layer or heterostructure onto prepared patterned elements
with subsequent van der Waals bonding. Using hBN/graphene heterostructures
transferred onto metallic island arrays as a model system, we reveal that
thermal cycling between room and cryogenic temperatures leads to irreversible
changes in electronic properties. This breakdown of reproducibility stems from
the temperature-dependent redistribution of interfacial water or organic
residues, which disrupts van der Waals bonding via a hydrophobic collapse
mechanism. Our findings establish constraints for low-temperature applications
of transferred 2D devices while providing insights into interfacial stability
in van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Magneto-transport properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in a chain of
planar quantum rings are investigated under the Rashba spin-orbit interaction
and a transverse homogeneous magnetic field. A modulation potential function
models the ring-chain periodicity along one direction and the confinement in
the perpendicular one. The electron energy minibands collapse into discrete
levels with high degeneracy at specific magnetic field values. The Rashba
effect significantly influences the system's properties. Calculations reveal a
transition from diamagnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the spin-difference
orbital magnetization at high Rashba coupling strengths. This is consistent
with the reversal of the spin-difference persistent current observed at the
same Rashba values. Total and spin-difference magnetizations exhibit
oscillations linked to miniband nodes. The longitudinal magnetoconductance
component shows oscillations resembling Shubnikov-De Haas behavior, while the
transverse component displays a ladder-like profile reminiscent of the quantum
Hall effect. However, both phenomena are more closely associated with the
periodic collapse of minibands, leading to strong density-of-states
oscillations, rather than with the mechanisms behind the quantum Hall effect.
This highlights the rich physics of quantum topological phases in
nanostructures with non-trivial geometry. At high Rashba coupling, this
behavior degrades. Spin magnetization shows pronounced oscillations, indicating
complex interplay between the Zeeman and Rashba effects on spin polarization.
These results offer insights into experimentally relevant electronic and spin
characteristics attainable in modulated semiconductor structures, contributing
to the development of advanced 2D-based materials for magneto-transport and
spintronics applications.

Abstract: Magnetic adatom chains on superconductors provide a platform to explore
correlated spin states and emergent quantum phases. Using low-temperature
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we study the distance-dependent interaction
between Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$. While single atoms exhibit four
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and partially occupied $d$ levels consistent with a
$S=2$ spin state, the spin is quenched when two Fe atoms reside in nearest
neighbor lattice sites, where the $d$ levels of the atoms hybridize. The
non-magnetic dimer configuration is stable in that dimerization persists in
chains with weak interactions among the dimers. Thus, the spin-state quenching
has important implications also for Fe chains. While even-numbered chains are
stable and non-magnetic, odd-numbered chains host a single magnetic atom at one
of the chain's ends, with its position being switchable by voltage pulses. Our
findings emphasize the role of interatomic coupling in shaping quantum ground
states and suggest that engineering alternating hopping amplitudes analogous to
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model may offer a pathway to realizing topological
systems.

Abstract: The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian
and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous
techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic
energies (which appear, e.g., in Wilczek and Shapere's classical time crystal,
or nonlinear capacitors) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre
transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel
transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that
such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of
well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the
coupling strength to a dissipative environment. Essentially there occurs a
dissipative phase transition from a non-convex Hamiltonian to a convex
Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. This
resolves apparent inconsistencies and provide computationally efficient methods
to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.

Conclusion: 这种方法为提升Graphene和其他二维材料的质量提供了可靠途径，有助于探索新的物理现象。

Abstract: The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring
quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of
optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport
and quantum mobilities reaching close to 10$^8$ and 10$^6$ cm$^2$/Vs,
respectively. Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving,
it remains comparatively lower. Here we report a transformative improvement in
the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its
immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge
inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10$^7$
cm$^-2$ and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum
mobilities reach 10$^7$ cm$^2$/Vs, surpassing those in the highest-quality
semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport
mobilities match their record. This quality enables Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaus below 5 mT.
Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron-electron
interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their
energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3-5 compared to unscreened devices,
demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm
remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic
quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate
the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.

Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as
mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the
latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two
phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting
phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic
field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a
sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer
Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit
sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset
temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our
observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and
topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new
frontier in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: We investigate the spin-polarized ballistic transport in a three-terminal

non-equilibrium Green function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
framework. We study the transmission spectrum, density of states, I-V
characteristics, spin-resolved conductance and spin current by varying ribbon
geometries and an out-of-plane Zeeman field. In absence of magnetization,
transport is dominated by subband quantization and resonant edge states, with
pronounced dependence on ribbon width and length while the introduction of a
Zeeman field offers spin-selective transport and inducing half-metallic
behavior, particularly in narrower ribbons, highlighting the interplay between
quantum confinement, edge-localized states and spin-dependent interactions.
Moreover, we found Fabry-P\'{e}rot-like interference in conductance spectrum
and bias-driven mode activation with strong spin filtering effects. The spin
current is found to be tunable via magnetic field and gate voltage. Also, it
remains stable under thermal fluctuations, demonstrating suitability for
room-temperature operation. Finally, the energy and width dependence of the
Fano factor reveals distinct quantum interference features and spin-polarized
transport signatures. These findings indicate the potential of the
three-terminal ZGNR based device for scalable and gate-controllable spintronic
applications.

Abstract: We compute the isotope shifts of the \emph{total} electron binding energy of
neutral atoms and singly charged ions up to element $Z=120$, using relativistic
Hartree-Fock method including the Breit interaction. Field shift coefficients
are extracted by varying the nuclear charge radius; a small quadratic term is
retained to cover large radius changes relevant to superheavy nuclei. We
tabulate isotope shift coefficients for closed shell systems from Ne to Og and
benchmark selected open shell cases, used to test the interpolation formula. A
simple power law interpolation $bZ^k$ reproduces calculated field shifts to
within about 1\% across the table, with the effective exponent $k$ growing from
roughly 5 near $Z \sim 50$ to about 12 at $Z \sim 118$. Due to the domination
of inner shells, differences between neutrals and singly charged ions does not
exceed few percent, becoming noticeable mainly when an outer $s$ electron is
removed. Therefore, these results may also be used for higher charge ions.

Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of $S$-wave exotic hydrogen-like
three-body systems ($pp\mu^-$, $pp\tau^-$, $\mu^-\mu^-p$, $\tau^-\tau^-p$,
$p\mu^-\tau^-$) with spin-parity $J^P = 1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$, and four-body
systems ($pp\mu^-\mu^-$, $pp\tau^-\tau^-$) with $J^P = 0^+$, $1^+$, and $2^+$.
We use complex scaling and Gaussian expansion methods to solve the
complex-scaled Schr\"{o}dinger equation and obtain possible bound and
quasi-bound states. The resulting binding energies range from $-33.8$~keV to
$-340$~eV. Notably, we present the first theoretical estimation of the
bound-state energy levels of $pp\mu^-\mu^-$ and $pp\tau^-\tau^-$, which is of
significant importance for understanding exotic few-body Coulomb systems. We
further analyze spin configurations and root-mean-square radii to elucidate the
spatial structure of these bound and quasi-bound states. Our results reveal
that $K$-type spatial configurations play a crucial role in accurately
describing bound and quasi-bound states in the hydrogen-molecule-like systems
$pp\mu^-\mu^-$ and $pp\tau^-\tau^-$. Incorporating $K$-type configurations
significantly alters the mass spectra of these states. Future muon colliders
and muon facilities may offer promising platforms for the possible copious
production of such heavy flavored hydrogen molecules and molecular ions. For

*V. A. Yerokhin,Z. Harman,C. H. Keitel*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: This study presents precise QED calculations for energy levels and transitions in Li-like ions with Z from 10 to 100, using an improved method involving the extended Furry picture. The results match well with experiments, enhancing the accuracy beyond previous studies, especially notable for uranium and bismuth. The findings have implications for nuclear charge radius determinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to address a niche area within atomic physics, specifically QED calculations for multicharged ions, which are less commonly studied. The mention of improving the accuracy of theoretical predictions and providing experimental validation suggests a need for precise results, particularly in heavy elements. The practical applications, such as nuclear charge radius determination, add to the paper's importance. The fact that this work could be a benchmark for future research makes it worth analyzing.

Method: The authors used systematic QED calculations for specific energy levels and transitions, employing the extended Furry picture to enhance convergence. They combined ab initio treatments for one and two-photon effects with approximate methods for higher-order effects. Validation against experimental data, especially for uranium and bismuth, demonstrates the method's efficacy. The results are used for high-precision nuclear charge radius determinations.

Result: The systematic QED calculations improve the accuracy of energy level and transition predictions. Theoretical values are often more precise than experimental results, with notable cases in uranium and bismuth. Experimental data supports the theoretical findings, indicating the method's reliability. The improved precision aids in determining nuclear charge radii with high accuracy.

Conclusion: This study enhances QED precision for Li-like ions, providing reliable theoretical predictions validated by experiments. The results are a valuable resource for atomic physics research and practical applications like nuclear charge radius determination. Future studies can build on this for even more precise calculations in heavy atoms and other quantum effects.

Abstract: Systematic QED calculations of ionization energies of the $2s$, $2p_{1/2}$,
and $2p_{3/2}$ states, as well as the $2p_{1/2}$--$2s$ and
$2p_{3/2}$--$2p_{1/2}$ transition energies are performed for Li-like ions with
the nuclear charge numbers $Z = 10$--$100$. The convergence of QED perturbative
expansion is improved by using the extended Furry picture, which starts from
the Dirac equation with a local screening potential. An ab initio treatment is
accomplished for one- and two-photon electron-structure QED effects and the
one-photon screening of the self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections.
This is complemented with an approximate treatment of the two-photon QED
screening and higher-order (three or more photon) electron-structure effects.
As a result, the obtained theoretical predictions improve upon the accuracy
achieved in previous calculations. Comparison with available experimental data
shows a good agreement between theory and experiment. In most cases, the
theoretical values surpass the experimental results in precision, with only a
few exceptions. In the case of uranium and bismuth, the comparison provides one
of the most stringent tests of bound-state QED in the strong-field regime.
Alternatively, the obtained results can be employed for high-precision
determinations of nuclear charge radii.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses experiments identifying a nuclear-clock isomer in $^{229}$Th by measuring ionization potentials, using both laser ionization and gas jet techniques, comparing theoretical and experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to determine if $^{229}$Th can function as a nuclear clock, specifically by identifying a nuclear isomer that oscillates at a different rate than the parent nuclide $^{232}$Th. This would create a robust timing standard based on nuclear transitions.

Method: The authors used laser ionization spectroscopy with specific conditions, tested a threshold approach with gas collisions, and employed a hypersonic gas jet to suppress collisions. They utilized the MCDHF method for computational validation and a U-233 source for further studies.

Result: The second ionization potential was found to be 12.300 eV, and the first ionization potential of Th was determined with high precision. Theoretical calculations matched experimental results within 0.06-0.19%.

Conclusion: While no photo-ionization signal was observed from $^{229}$Th^+$, the experiments provided precise ionization potentials, supporting the potential as a nuclear clock isomer for timekeeping applications.

Abstract: Laser ionization spectroscopy was performed on both neutral and singly
ionized $^{232}$Th with the aim of identifying the nuclear-clock isomer in the
singly charged ionic state of $^{229}$Th. A search for an efficient laser
ionization scheme of $^{232}$Th$^+$ was conducted in an argon-filled gas cell.
This revealed a congested spectrum due to collisional quenching effects and the
presence of several auto-ionizing states, one of which has a laser ionization
efficiency of at least $1.2 \%$. Using a threshold approach, the second
ionization potential was determined to be $12.300(9)\,$eV. The subsequent study
on atomic $^{232}$Th validated the threshold approach. Conducting spectroscopy
in a hypersonic gas jet, suppressed the gas-collision-induced quenching,
revealing a Rydberg series that converges to the first ionization potential,
determined to be $6.306879(14)\,$eV. The gas jet also cools down the thorium,
allowing for high-resolution laser spectroscopy with a resolution of
$240(30)\,$MHz. Using the Multiconfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF)
method, the ionization potentials were computed, showing a relative difference
of 0.06\% and 0.19\% between theory and our experimental values for the
ionization potentials of Th and Th$^+$ respectively. Further calculations using
a pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method reveal strong mixing in the used
intermediate state at $26113.27\,$cm$^{-1}$ of Th. A dedicated fast-extraction
gas cell with $^{233}$U recoil sources was used to study $^{229}$Th$^+$ but no
photo-ionization signal could be observed.

### [123] [Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21209)
*Yi-Ting Tu,David M. Long,Dominic V. Else*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses t Hooft anomalies in lattice systems, defining lattice anomalies as topological invariants of the symmetry action, which are more general than QFT anomalies and include non-trivial anomalies that are IR-trivial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring anomalies in lattice systems can provide insights into both condensed matter physics and high-energy physics. This paper aims to bridge these two areas by defining a framework for lattice anomalies.

Method: The authors used a systematic approach, starting with theoretical analysis and moving to concrete applications in different areas such as commuting projector models, MBL systems, and QCA.

Result: They establish that lattice anomalies are more general than QFT anomalies, showing that some anomalies are non-trivial yet IR-trivial.

Conclusion: This work unifies the understanding of symmetries in quantum many-body lattice systems with quantum field theory, suggesting new methods and implications for further research in both fields.

Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum
many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a
systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in
lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice
anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological
invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems
allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of
the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the
expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial
differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not,
contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can
be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they
admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies
at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including
IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right,
including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body
localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make
substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop
several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric
Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems
into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on
symmetries in QFT.

TL;DR: 研究了Yao-Lee模型在加入Kitaev和Heisenberg交互后的相图，发现当Kitaev主导时，自旋出现磁序而轨道液态；而Yao-Lee主导时两者液态。Heisenberg交还可以调节磁序强度。

Result: 加入Kitaev和Heisenberg交后，自旋和轨道不同主导下表现出不同的液体和磁序状态。

Conclusion: 推广了Yao-Lee模型，展示了复杂相互作用下的新相变和相图。

Abstract: Spin-orbital generalizations of Kitaev model, such as Yao-Lee model, have
attracted recent attention due to their enhanced stability of spin liquid
phases against perturbations. Motivated by microscopic calculations for the
realization of Yao-Lee model showing additional interactions, we study the
phase diagram of the Yao-Lee model with added Kitaev and Heisenberg terms.
While the plaquette operator is conserved even in the presence of added
perturbations, the model becomes no longer exactly solvable. Using perturbation
and Majorana mean-field theory, we find magnetic order can arise in the spin
sector while the orbital sector remains a liquid for dominant Kitaev
interactions, whereas both sectors form liquid phases when Yao-Lee interactions
dominate. Additional Heisenberg exchange can enhance or suppress the magnetic
order, revealing a rich coexistence of magnetic and topological phases.

### [125] [Anomaly-free symmetries with obstructions to gauging and onsiteability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21267)
*Wilbur Shirley,Carolyn Zhang,Wenjie Ji,Michael Levin*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents counterexamples to the idea that certain symmetries are anomalous, showing that some symmetries can't be gauged or coupled to gauge fields but are still anomaly-free. They are characterized by an index in H^2(G, Q+).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the relationship between symmetries and anomalies in 2D lattice models, challenging common assumptions about gaugeability and anomaly necessity.

Method: They construct specific unitary symmetries and demonstrate their anomaly-free nature by constructing symmetric, gapped Hamiltonians with unique ground states. They use cellular automata to characterize these symmetries with an index in a cohomology group.

Result: The symmetries in question are anomaly-free, even though they can't be gauged, and are characterized by an index in H^2(G, Q+). This provides new insights into how symmetries and anomalies interact in condensed matter systems.

Conclusion: The paper expands our understanding by showing that some internal symmetries, which aren't traditionally considered for gauging, can exist without anomalies, and these symmetries are fully described using cohomological invariants.

Abstract: We present counterexamples to the lore that symmetries that cannot be gauged
or made on-site are necessarily anomalous. Specifically, we construct unitary,
internal symmetries of two-dimensional lattice models that cannot be
consistently coupled to background or dynamical gauge fields or disentangled to
a tensor product of on-site operators. These symmetries are nevertheless
anomaly-free in the sense that they admit symmetric, gapped Hamiltonians with
unique, invertible ground states. We show that symmetries of this kind are
characterized by an index $[\omega]\in H^2(G,\mathbb{Q}_+)$, where
$\mathbb{Q}_+$ is the multiplicative group of rational numbers labeling
one-dimensional quantum cellular automata.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找材料的超导特性有助于理解材料中的磁性行为以及电子 frustrating 现象。κ-BEST-CN与κ-ET-CN相比，结构相同，但通过改变压力而不是改变离异离子结构来实现超导，这为研究 κ-ET-CN 的异常磁学特性提供了一个参考材料，且自旋磁导率的变化提供了揭示异常磁学现象的新方向。

Method: 高温下，通过电阻率测量、超导电性测试以及磁学测量等手段，比较了 κ-BEST-CN 和 κ-ET-CN 的电子和磁学性质。特别是，通过施加较小的高压，观察到 κ-BEST-CN 的超导行为。

Result: 在0.1 GPa压力下，κ-BEST-CN表现出超导特性，临界温度约为4 K。自旋磁导率略高于对照液 κ-ET-CN，且无明显温度依赖性。这些结果支持了κ-BEST-CN作为研究κ-ET-CN异常磁性行为的参考材料，并揭示了 frustrating系统中的自旋磁导率行为。

Conclusion: 通过改变压力而非改变离异离子的结构，κ-BEST-CN展示了与κ-ET-CN isostructural 的一致行为，并提供了一个新的视角来研究κ-ET-CN的量子自旋状态和超导机制。自旋磁导率的变化可能提供见解来解释和模拟附近Mott转变的复杂 frustrating 磁性行为。这为未来理论研究提供了一个新方向。

Abstract: We report the structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of the organic
conductor $\kappa$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (BEST:
bis(ethylenediseleno)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-BEST-CN),
which is isostructural with the quantum spin liquid candidate
$\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (ET: bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene;
abbreviated as $\kappa$-ET-CN). Resistivity measurements demonstrate that
$\kappa$-BEST-CN exhibits semiconducting behavior, governed by the same
conducting mechanism as $\kappa$-ET-CN. Under a pressure of ~0.1 GPa,
$\kappa$-BEST-CN undergoes a superconducting transition with an onset
temperature of ~4 K. From the comparison of the critical pressures of
superconductivity between $\kappa$-ET-CN and $\kappa$-BEST-CN, $\kappa$-BEST-CN
can be regarded as a chemically pressurized analogue of $\kappa$-ET-CN.
Therefore, $\kappa$-BEST-CN, in which only the effective pressure changes
without altering the anion structure, is considered a valuable reference
material for elucidating the enigmatic properties observed in $\kappa$-ET-CN.
Furthermore, the spin susceptibility of $\kappa$-BEST-CN is slightly larger
than that of $\kappa$-ET-CN and shows weaker temperature dependence, which
cannot be explained by the localized spin model. This behavior clarifies the
anomalous magnetic properties of a system with frustration near the Mott
transition, serving to stimulate future theoretical research.

Result: 在温度和磁场范围内没有发现热霍尔信号，同时热导率与之前研究一致。

Conclusion: 材料在低温下表现出磁性转变附近的线性行为和微弱磁滞现象。

Abstract: We investigated the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ and
thermal hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ in La$_2$CuO$_4$ at temperatures $T$
between 2 and 20 K in magnetic fields $H$ up to 10 T. Within the temperature
and field intervals studied, we do not resolve any thermal Hall signal with a
conservative upper bound of $|\kappa_{xy}/T| <1\times10^{-4}$ ${\rm
Wm^{-1}K^{-2}}$. The longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}/T$ agrees
well with previous studies, in both magnitude and $T$ dependence. In both
channels, we performed measurements using the field-sweep protocol. To achieve
high resolution, we carefully took into account relaxation effects after each
step-increase in $H$. At low $T$, we find a linear decrease in $\kappa/T$ vs.
$H$, as well as weak hysteresis near the meta-magnetic transition of the spin
degrees.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了对 Hall 效应的理解，揭示了多极对称性下的新机制，为未来研究与应用提供了基础。

Abstract: The Hall effect, particularly that arising from in-plane magnetic field, has
recently emerged as a sensitive probe of quantum geometric properties in
solids. Especially in trigonal systems, in-plane anomalous Hall effect (AHE)
can be explicitly induced by nontrivial off-diagonal coupling between the
magnetic field and the Hall vector on the principal plane. Here we elucidate
multipolar dependence of the off-diagonal coupling in the in-plane AHE, by
systematically measuring on the (001) principal plane of trigonal
antiferromagnet EuCd2Sb2 thin films for each magnetic phase. Around zero field,
magneto-cubic dependence of anomalous Hall resistivity is clearly observed not
only in the paramagnetic phase but also even in the antiferromagnetic phase. An
off-diagonal component of the octupolar tensor also exhibits unconventional
decay above the magnetic ordering temperature, roughly depending on the inverse
temperature to the third power. In the forced ferromagnetic phase, on the other
hand, magneto-linear dependence dominantly appears and notably persists up to
very high fields. Our findings clarify key aspects of the off-diagonal coupling
in the in-plane AHE, paving the way for its future investigations and potential
applications beyond conventional expectations about the Hall effect.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper examines a spin-1 dimer chain model using DMRG, developing a new basis transformation that incorporates local dimer eigenstates while keeping parallel spin states. The study reveals a rich phase diagram influenced by frustration and a magnetic field, with varied ground state properties like Haldane character, fragmentation, and clustering. They analyze static and dynamic properties to understand complex interactions in the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by studying complex quantum phases in low-dimensional spin systems, particularly for S=1 Heisenberg models, which are relevant for various condensed matter systems and provide insights into real materials through model studies.

Method: The authors employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm with a new basis transformation. This transformation includes local dimer eigenstates for more effective symmetry implementation and reduces entanglement bias in DMRG. The method involves a detailed analysis of static properties, including spin quantum numbers, entanglement entropy, and spin-spin correlations, as well as low-energy dynamics through the dynamic structure factor.

Result: The study finds a rich ground state phase diagram with different quantum phases emerging based on frustration levels and magnetic field. These phases include effective Haldane chains, fragmented ground states, and clustering states. The phases are characterized using static properties, and dynamic properties further validate the phase transitions and nature of these quantum phases.

Conclusion: This paper's findings are crucial for understanding the emergence of complex quantum phases in interacting spin systems, especially when considering factors like geometric frustration and external fields, offering valuable insights for both theoretical models and potential real-world materials.

Abstract: The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses
the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin
states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the
symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground
state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of
inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration)
and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective
Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground
state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static
properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and
the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully
selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are
complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of
the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the
emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong
interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for
interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.

Conclusion: 开放量子系统使相互作用费米子的热化过程产生显著的改变，与相互作用和环境参数密切相关。 this research highlights the unique dynamics of fermion systems under open quantum systems并为潜在的实验验证提供了方向。

Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of correlated fermions evolving in presence
of a local dephasing bath. To this extent we consider the infinite coordination
limit of the corresponding Lindblad master equation, provided by Dynamical
Mean-Field Theory for open quantum systems. We solve the resulting quantum
impurity problem, describing an Anderson impurity coupled to a local dephasing,
using weak-coupling perturbation theory in interaction and dephasing. We show
that the dissipative dynamics describes heating towards infinite temperature,
with a relaxation rate that depends strongly on interaction. The resulting
steady-state spectral functions are however non-trivial and show an interplay
between coherent quasiparticle peak and local dephasing. We then discuss how
thermalization towards infinite temperature emerges within DMFT, by solving the
impurity problem throughout its self-consistency. We show that thermalization
under open quantum system dynamics is qualitatively different from the closed
system case. In particular, the thermalization front found in the unitary is
strongly modified, a signature of the irreversibility of the open system
dynamics.

*Shalika R. Bhandari,R. Tamang,Keshav Shrestha,Samy Brahimi,Samir Lounis,D. P. Rai*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: FeSb2 is an altermagnetic material with significant pressure effects on its electronic properties and anomalous Hall response. The material remains stable under high pressure but exhibits varying Hall conductivities depending on the pressure applied.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of new materials with interesting magnetic and electronic properties often leads to further exploration of their applications, especially in areas like electronics and spintronics. This paper focuses on FeSb2, an altermagnet, investigating how external pressure influences its properties, which is crucial for understanding its potential uses in material science and technology.

Method: Density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier function analysis were used to model the material's electronic structure under various pressures. Theoretical calculations were complemented by analysis of phonon frequencies and berry curvature to understand the Hall response.

Result: FeSb2 maintains dynamic stability up to 10 GPa with a positive phonon frequency. The material exhibits an anomalous Hall response with conductivity values ranging from -1 to 1 eV, which changes with pressure. Spin Hall conductivity is half the magnitude of the anomalous Hall conductivity. The results suggest that pressure can tune the topological and electronic properties of FeSb2, making it suitable for applications in strain-engineered magnetic systems.

Conclusion: FeSb2 is a promising candidate for novel electronic applications, particularly as an altermagnetic material where pressure can modulate both its electronic and magnetic properties effectively, enhancing its potential for future technological advancements.

Abstract: We have investigated the pressure-dependent electronic structure, phonon
stability, and anomalous Hall response of the recently discovered altermagnet
FeSb2 from density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier function analysis. From
density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, we have found that
FeSb2 remains dynamically stable up to 10 GPa, evidenced by positive phonon
frequencies. Our spin-polarised band structure shows that the node of band
crossing between spin-up and spin-down bands around the Fermi energy exactly
lies at the Gamma and A-symmetry points. The Fermi crossing is mostly exhibited
by band-24, band-25 and band-26. The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS)
along M'-Gamma-M and A-Z-A' symmetry is attributed to the broken time-reversal
(PT ) symmetry. There are significant changes in the band profile under applied
pressure, as one can see the shifting of the node of band-24 and band-26
towards the lower energy side. The NRSS exhibited by band-24 along M'-Gamma-M
symmetry is notably small. Although the strength of NRSS of band-26 along
A-Z-A' symmetry is significant but reduces under applied pressure. The
anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) values are prominent in -1 to 1 eV range. A
sharp peaked and positive AHC values at ambient pressure, becomes spectrally
broadened and negative at 10 GPa due to pressure-induced band crossings and
redistribution of Berry curvature near the Fermi level. We have observed that
the values of spin hall conductivity (SHC) are around 2-2.5 times lower as
compared to AHC and prominent in between -1.0 eV to 1.0 eV. Our results
establish FeSb2 as a tunable altermagnetic candidate where pressure can
modulate both topological transport and dynamic stability, offering
opportunities for strain-engineered Hall responses in compensated magnetic
