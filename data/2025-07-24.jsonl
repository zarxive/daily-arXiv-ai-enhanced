Conventional neural networks\noffer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without\ninherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical\ndomains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have\nemerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty\nquantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed\nfor deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This\nposes a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic\nprocessing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an\nenergy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic\nmagnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven\nstrategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and\ntheir dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing\nfor AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW\nstochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling\nmagnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic\nfunctionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we\nimplement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its\nfunctionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS\nimplementations, our approach achieves a seven orders of magnitude improvement\nin the overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency,\nenergy consumption, and speed. These results underscore the MPC platform's\npotential to enable reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems."}

Recent research on discrete systems showed that this\neffect can pose a barrier for waves hitting an interface between reciprocal and\nnon-reciprocal systems. Under certain conditions, however, waves can tunnel\nthrough this barrier, similar to the tunneling of particles in quantum\nmechanics. This work proposes and investigates an active acoustic metamaterial\ndesign to realize this tunneling phenomenon in the acoustical wave domain. The\nmetamaterial consists of an acoustic waveguide with microphones and\nloudspeakers embedded in its wall. Starting from a purely discrete\nnon-Hermitian lattice model of the system, a hybrid continuous-discrete\nacoustic model is derived, resulting in distributed feedback control laws to\nrealize the desired behavior for acoustic waves. The proposed control laws are\nvalidated using frequency and time domain finite element method simulations,\nwhich include lumped electro-acoustic loudspeaker models.

The standard\napproach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various\nnumerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the\nderivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a\nprocedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy\nscales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous\nformulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the\nrenormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129\n(2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target\nspace (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the\nthe rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we\nstate conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded\neffective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize\nthe exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase\napproximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting\nrelevant corrections in the process.

In addition to real particles like atoms and composite bosons such as\nCooper pairs or excitons, this phenomenon is also observed in gases of\nquasiparticles such as polaritons and magnons - quanta of spin-wave excitations\nin magnetic media. The fundamental property of the BEC state is its coherence,\nwhich is represented by a precisely defined phase of the corresponding wave\nfunction, which arises spontaneously and encompasses all particles gathered at\nthe bottom of their spectrum. Until now, the BEC phase was only revealed in\nphenomena depending on the spatial phase difference, such as interference,\nsecond order coherence, and macroscopic BEC motions - supercurrents,\nsuperfluidity and Josephson oscillations. Here, we present a method for the\ndirect time-domain measurement of the magnon BEC coherent state phase relative\nto an outside reference signal.

We demonstrate coil-resonator locking which suppresses the 1\nkHz frequency noise by 40 dB over the 35 nm wide comb spectrum, with comb line\nlinewidths as low as 66 Hz and 108 GHz soliton repetition rate phase noise\nequivalent to -118 dBc/Hz when divided down to 10 GHz. The low power PZT\nactuator consumes nW bias power and the coil resonator allows flexible dual\nlocking using arbitrary comb lines. These results show a clear path towards\nfull chip integration of stabilized soliton microcombs with simplicity and\nversatility absent in other schemes."}

A project is therefore under way to link IB3A to an existing\npurification and liquefaction station in a neighboring building through a\ndedicated pipeline. Captured helium will be transferred, purified, reliquefied,\nand returned for reuse, cutting losses and operating costs.

These complementary\nstrategies address two major challenges in microcomb implementation:\nenvironmental sensitivity and resonance instability. Building on prior work\nusing single-mode fiber (SMF)-based direct coupling, which demonstrated device\nminiaturization and partial suppression of thermal drift in coupling\nefficiency, our PMF-based approach offers enhanced thermal stability and\nsignificantly greater robustness to environmental disturbances such as\ntemperature fluctuations and vibration. In our system, precision alignment\nusing microscopes or multi-axis stages is no longer required, enabling a\nsimplified optical setup and stable long-term operation. The direct coupling\nscheme achieved a coupling efficiency of 57.7% and maintained soliton operation\nfor over 24 hours under external perturbations. In parallel, active temperature\ncontrol of the microresonator was quantitatively evaluated, reducing the\nwavelength variation of the pump and auxiliary lasers by 79% and 97%,\nrespectively. This stability enables reproducible soliton generation even in\nthermally dynamic environments. Comparative experiments with SMF-based direct\ncoupling and lensed-SMF-based free-space coupling systems confirmed the\nsuperior performance of the PMF-based design in terms of coupling stability,\nsoliton lifetime, and immunity to environmental noise.

Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly\ncorrelated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase\nand its transition to a Mott insulator.

The presence of asymptotic states ensures gauge invariance of the\ntheory, but, in the case of gravity, the states exist only in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes, that limits possible topologies. Then we have two ways. The\nfirst way is to consider only asymptotically flat spacetimes. In fact, it\nreduces quantum gravity to quantum field theory on a given background. The\nsecond way is to reject the assumption about asymptotic states. In the case of\nnon-trivial topology, one cannot cover the whole spacetime with the only\ncoordinate system. One has to introduce various reference frames fixed by\ndifferent gauge conditions in different spacetime regions. The Hamiltonian\ndescribing a gravitating system will depend on gauge conditions.

In two-site Kitaev chains, we find that maximally entangled\nstates can robustly emerge, with their stability and periodicity highly\ncontrollable by the interplay between the superconducting pair potential and\nthe onsite energies. At the finely tuned sweet spot, where Majorana\nquasiparticles appear, the system exhibits oscillations between separable and\nentangled states, whereas detuning introduces tunable valleys in the\nentanglement dynamics.
