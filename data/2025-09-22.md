Abstract: Garfield++ is extensively used within the gaseous detector community for
comprehensive detector simulations, supporting the full experimental life cycle
from design to operation and calibration. The emergence of micro-pattern
gaseous detectors has necessitated computationally intensive microscopic
avalanche simulations. The acceleration of one of Garfield++'s most demanding
algorithms, AvalancheMicroscopic, by porting it to graphics processing units
using NVIDIA's CUDA framework is described. The modifications are integrated
into the Garfield++ codebase and are accessible to end users with only minor
adjustments to their existing code. Benchmark results demonstrate substantial
speed-up, especially for high-gain avalanches involving thousands of electrons,
thereby enabling more efficient and detailed detector simulations.

Abstract: The lifetime of the isomeric state in fully stripped 94Ru44+ ions has been
measured using isochronous mass spectrometry (IMS) at the experimental Cooler
Storage Ring (CSRe) of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL).
Previously, the isomeric lifetime was determined by analyzing the decay time
points of individual decay events. In this paper, we present a novel approach
to determine the isomeric lifetime based on the survival time of ions obtained
from IMS. The survival lifetimes of the ground and isomeric states of 94Ru44+
were measured to be s and s in the laboratory, respectively. Given that the
ground state of 94Ru44+ has a natural lifetime of approximately 75 min, its
survival lifetime in the experimental setup was predominantly determined by the
beam-loss lifetime, including interactions with residual gas in the storage
ring and carbon foil of the detector. In contrast, the survival lifetime of
94mRu44+ was governed by its intrinsic nuclear lifetime and additional
beam-loss effects. The nuclear decay lifetime of 94mRu44+ was extracted through
differential survival lifetime analysis between ground and isomeric states,
under the assumption that the beam-loss lifetimes for both quantum systems are
identical. Using this novel methodology, the lifetime measured in the
laboratory frame was s. After relativistic time-dilation corrections, the
corresponding rest-frame half-life was calculated to be s. This result
demonstrates excellent consistency with previous experimental results,
validating the reliability of the new method. This method is suitable for
determining half-lives of highly charged ions in the range of several tens of
microseconds to milliseconds using IMS.

### [3] [Thin-film boundary-layer diffusion of non-equilibrium flow to kinetically limited reactive surfaces via Damköhler thermochemistry tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15427)
*Jeffrey D. Engerer,Lincoln N. Collins*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法来计算大气 entry的热化学表层参数，通过结合边界层积分解法和有限速率表面反应模型，改进了现有的热化学平衡假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着空间飞行器和 reusable航天器的开发，对大气 entry过程中的热化学行为进行更准确的建模变得愈发重要。特别是在进入复杂大气环境时，现有方法的局限性日益显现，因此需要一种更灵活和精确的方法来计算热化学参数。

Method: 作者在该论文中提出了一种基于边界层积分解法的新方法，该方法结合了墙气体的自由氧和有限速率表面反应模型。与传统方法不同，作者并未将有限速率反应模型嵌入到均匀的热化学平衡求解过程中，而是将反应模型与边界层积分解法相结合，并通过预计算表格来简化求解过程。

Result: 初步结果显示，该方法改进了现有热化学表层模型的精度，尤其是在处理复杂材料和非均匀表面反应条件下。然而，该方法在处理更高阶的物理模型和复杂材料时仍有一定局限性，未来需要进一步研究以克服这些限制。

Conclusion: 该研究为大气 entry过程中更精确和灵活的热化学建模提供了一种创新方法。但其在处理复杂材料和高阶物理模型方面的应用仍需更多研究和支持。

Abstract: Traditional ablation thermochemistry tables for atmospheric entry are derived
from boundary-layer element diffusion assuming homogeneous and heterogeneous
thermochemical equilibrium at the vehicle surface. Prior techniques for
finite-rate surface reactions predominantly embed specific heterogeneous
reaction models within the homogeneous equilibrium solution procedures and
tables. This paper disseminates a boundary-layer integral solution for wall-gas
free oxygen coupled to finite-rate surface kinetics. Solutions are
pre-tabulated along normalized kinetics variables without direct integration
into an equilibrium thermochemistry solver. This technique allows greater
flexibility in presumed kinetics rates and wall-gas conditions in simple
air-carbon systems, but the extensibility to state-of-the-art simulations and
complex materials remains uncertain. A derivation and preliminary results are
presented to the encourage further development.

### [4] [Whisker-Like Sensors: Effective Design, Pauline Pounds, Manivannan M](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15925)
*Prasanna Kumar Routray,Debadutta Subudhi*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: A modular system for flexible bio-inspired whisker sensors with trade-offs between rigidity and flexibility optimized for different applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create sensors suitable for diverse applications with balanced durability, reconfigurability, and simplicity.

Method: Modular architecture with five components: WE, CE, SE, SS, DAQ. Four designs tested with varying materials and structures.

Result: Rigid whiskers improve classification accuracy; flexible whiskers enhance exploratory tasks. Hall-effect with rubber CE performs best.

Conclusion: Trade-off analysis identifies optimal sensor configurations for robotics and texture analysis.

Abstract: Bio-inspired whisker sensors are employed in diverse applications such as
fluid-flow sensing, texture analysis, and environmental exploration. However,
existing designs often face challenges related to durability, fabrication
complexity, and response consistency. To address these issues, we propose a
modular architecture that decomposes whisker sensors into five functional
components: the whisker element (WE), compliant element (CE), sensing element
(SE), support structure (SS), and data acquisition module (DAQ). We develop and
compare four in-house sensor designs built using this architecture, each
differing in material choice, sensing modality, and mechanical structure. To
unify heterogeneous sensor outputs, we introduce a calibration strategy that
maps raw sensor readings-whether from pressure, magnetic flux, or visual
features-into a common representation: the bending moment at the whisker base.
This representation supports consistent interpretation and comparison across
sensing techniques. We adopt texture roughness analysis as a representative
sensing task to evaluate design trade-offs. Each whisker sensor's
frequency-domain response is benchmarked against a high-resolution laser sensor
using standardized roughness specimens. Empirical results show that rigid
whiskers improve accuracy in texture classification, while flexible whiskers
provide robustness for exploratory robotics tasks. Among the evaluated designs,
the Hall-effect sensor with a rubber CE demonstrates the most favorable balance
of durability, reconfigurability, and fabrication simplicity.

Motivation: 信息悖论是量子力学与广义相对论之间的一个核心问题，尤其在黑体和量子纠缠的背景下，这个问题一直激励着理论物理学家探索新的概念和方法。

Method: 研究者使用了引力路径积分和非扰动贡献的方法，结合了矩阵积分来推广分析范围和解释悖论。在矩阵积分框架下，引入了新的鞍点来解决负熵问题。

Result: 研究者展示了如何通过汇总所有非扰动贡献来解决LMRS提出的原问题，并使用矩阵积分扩展了分析，使得在一般情况下负性被解除。此外，他们还用随机张量网络技术提出了类似的问题及其解决方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究对理解量子纠缠和熵在黑体问题中的行为提供了重要的见解，并展示了不同方法（如随机张量网络）在解决复杂物理问题中的潜在应用。

Abstract: Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg, and Shan (LMRS) presented a new information
paradox in black hole physics by noticing that the entanglement and R\'enyi
entropies in a two-sided black hole can become negative when the geometry
contains a very large number of matter excitations behind the black hole
horizon. While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS
two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact
persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large
number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\'enyi entropies in
ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a
necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of
black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement
negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more
general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative
contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result
from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our
analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in
the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new
saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue
instanton. Finally, we formulate a similar puzzle and its resolution using
random tensor network techniques.

### [6] [Higher-form symmetries as higher automorphism bundles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15301)
*Alonso Perez-Lona*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates global higher-form symmetries in gauge theory using advanced mathematical tools, providing both theoretical insights and physical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper appears to build on existing work on higher-form symmetries, suggesting a need for a more systematic mathematical framework. The study combines concepts from differential geometry, higher categories, and gauge theory to explore these symmetries more deeply.

Method: The authors use techniques from higher categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory. They rigorously construct higher-form symmetries for pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie 2-group, including center higher-form symmetries. They apply these methods to specific physical examples such as U(1) bundles, bundle gerbes, and string 2-groups related to SU(n) instantons and 5d supergravity.

Result: The paper rigorously constructs global higher-form symmetries for pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie 2-group. It explores several physically relevant examples, revealing relationships between global higher-form symmetries, connection data, and symmetry gauging. The results clarify and reproduce previous discussions in the literature, offering a more systematic understanding of global higher-form symmetries in gauge theory.

Conclusion: The paper advances the mathematical understanding of global higher-form symmetries in gauge theory. It provides a framework for constructing and analyzing such symmetries and demonstrates the applicability of these tools to important physical scenarios. The inclusion of detailed examples strengthens the case for the relevance of higher-form symmetries in both theoretical and applied contexts.

Abstract: The notion of global higher-form symmetries has received much attention, but
leaves room for a more systematic mathematical formulation. In this article, we
highlight the concept of higher automorphism bundles from the field of higher
categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory, and we demonstrate
that this neatly reproduces and clarifies many examples and phenomena discussed
in the literature. We rigorously construct the higher-form symmetries of pure
gauge theory of a general strict Lie $2$-group, featuring center higher-form
symmetries. We then apply this explicitly to several physically-relevant
examples, such as $U(1)$ bundles, bundle gerbes, and certain string $2$-groups
related to $SU(n)$ instanton restriction, and $5d$ supergravity. We elaborate
on the nontrivial interplay between global higher-form symmetries, connection
data, and symmetry gauging.

Method: 构建推广的对偶轨道作用模型，与场论的观测ables框架进行比较，分析相关的数学关系以导出$S$-矩阵公式，同时引入简单模型来探讨费米悖论。

Result: 导出了$S$-矩阵公式，展示了对偶轨道作用与场论观测ables框架的兼容性，并提出了一种对费米悖论的可能解释。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解观测者与场论之间的关系提供了新的视角，并为解决费米悖论提出了一种简洁的解决方案，进一步促进了对宇宙中可能存在其他生命的理解。

Abstract: A generalization of the coadjoint orbit action describes the dynamics of an
observer (or instrument). We consider how this fits in with the view of
observables in field theory being correlations of read-outs of instruments and
show how one recovers the usual $S$-matrix formulae. A simple resolution of the
Fermi paradox is also pointed out.

### [8] [Topological invariant for holographic Weyl-Nodal line coexisting semimetal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15574)
*Xiantong Chen,Xuanting Ji,Ya-Wen Sun*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Strongly coupled holographic semimetals exhibit topological phases with unique features such as band-crossing and multi Fermi surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The investigation of topological phases in strongly coupled holographic semimetals provides valuable insights into condensed matter physics, particularly in understanding complex band structures and their implications for physical phenomena.

Method: Systematic computation of topological invariants, including Weyl charge, nodal ring charges, and a novel mirror symmetry-protected topological invariant, was employed in the analysis of the semimetals' properties.

Result: The presence of Weyl, nodal line, and Weyl-Nodal line coexisting semimetallic states, along with unique topological invariants, highlights distinctive characteristics of these strongly coupled systems.

Conclusion: The research offers a comprehensive exploration of topological phases in holographic semimetals, offering new perspectives for both theoretical and experimental condensed matter physicists.

Abstract: The presence of a topological phase in a topological many-body system can be
distinguished through the analysis of topological invariants. In the present
study, the topological invariants for the strongly coupled holographic
semimetals have been systematically computed, especially focusing on the
holographic Weyl-Nodal line coexisting semimetal. The topological invariants
that we calculate include the Weyl charge, the topological charges for a nodal
ring $\zeta_0$, $\zeta_1$, $\zeta_2$ and an additional mirror symmetry
protected topological invariant, $\widetilde{\zeta}_{2}$, that we herein
introduce. In addition, the effective band structures and topological
invariants in the critical phases of holographic semimetals are investigated,
including the case of Weyl, nodal line and Weyl-Nodal line coexisting
semimetals. The findings indicate the presence of notable and unique features
inherent to strongly coupled topological semimetals, including band-crossing
ordering interchange and multi Fermi surfaces, which provide a valuable
platform for experimental investigations of strongly coupled semimetals in
condensed matter physics.

### [9] [Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15731)
*Kazuya Mameda,Naoki Yamamoto*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Quasiparticles may have Berry curvature and quantum metric. A formalism based on Dirac brackets is developed, which modifies phase-space density of states at O(ℏ²) and corrections to physical quantities like energy density and current. The framework extends chiral kinetic theory. Applications in high-energy physics and astrophysics are suggested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper appears to study the effects of Berry curvature and quantum metric on quasiparticles and their implications in kinetic theory.

Method: The authors consider quasiparticles in momentum space with Berry curvature and quantum metric, develop a canonical formalism using Dirac brackets. They explore formal modifications to phase-space density of states, energy density, energy current, and apply their framework to chiral fermions for a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory.

Result: At O(ℏ²), quantum metric induces corrections to the phase-space density of states, energy density, and energy current. The framework provides a consistent extension of chiral kinetic theory to nonlinear cases. Applications in high-energy physics and astrophysics are indicated.

Conclusion: The inclusion of quantum metric leads to deviations from classical behavior at O(ℏ²). Formulating quasiparticles with both Berry curvature and quantum metric paves the way for new insights into physical phenomena described by kinetic theory and related quantities, particularly in scenarios involving nontrivial Berry curvatures, inhomogeneous electric fields, and chiral fermions.

Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric
in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles
based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the
phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections
to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In
particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field,
quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current.
Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of
chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the
way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and
astrophysics.

### [10] [New recursion relations for M2-brane matrix models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15801)
*Bin He,Tomoki Nosaka*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 该论文研究了带有单个伴随超多重和$N_	ext{f}$个基础超多重的$	ext{N}=4$超杨米尔斯理论在$S^3$上的精确$N$值，描述了$N$个M2-膜在$	ext{C}^2	imes	ext{C}^2/	ext{Z}_{N_	ext{f}}$上的质量及 FI 徘调。研究了partition函数的母方程，并导出了$N$的递推公式，应用于确定了自由能的首项$1/N$的非微扰修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超杨米尔斯理论在不同几何背景下的partition函数及其递推关系，有助于理解膜叠、高维空间和AdS/CFT对应。

Method: 通过分析partition函数的结构，导出了母方程，并利用递推关系求解了非微扰修正。

Result: 导出了$1/N$阶非微扰修正表达式，应用于AdS/CFT对向，预期可获3d wrapped M2-膜的内测空间体积贡献。

Conclusion: 论文通过M2-膜在特定空间的构造，深入研究了$	ext{N}=4$超杨米尔斯理论的partition函数及其非微扰效应。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the finite $N$ exact values of the $S^3$
partition function of the ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with one adjoint
hypermultiplet and $N_\text{f}$ fundamental hypermultiplets, which describes
$N$ M2-branes on $\mathbb{C}^2\times \mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{N_\text{f}}$,
with mass and FI deformations. We claim that the grand canonical sum of the
partition function obeys a bilinear difference relation with respect to the
shifts of the mass parameters of the fundamental hypermultiplets, which results
in a new recursion relation for the partition function with respect to $N$. As
an application, we also determine the analytic expression for the leading $1/N$
non-perturbative correction to the free energy of these models, which would
correspond holographically to the contribution from an M2-brane wrapped on a 3d
volume in the internal space of $\text{AdS}_4\times
S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{N_\text{f}}$.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Viewed through the lens of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we demonstrate
that higher-form currents with nonzero ghost number also define higher-form
symmetries, directly analogous to the standard higher-form symmetries with
ghost number zero. These ghostly higher symmetries descend from and into
conventional higher-form symmetries via chains of descent equations familiar
from the theory of anomalies and topological field theories. We give examples
of such chains of ghostly symmetries in Maxwell theory, Abelian and non-Abelian
higher gauge theory, Yang-Mills theory, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究矩阵模型的自由能计算与最优解是理论物理中的重要课题，Bootstrap方法的引入为复杂模型提供了解决方案。

Method: 通过Bootstrap方法分析矩阵模型的特性，使用计算得到的动量重构特征值概率分布，并计算自由能来选择最优解。

Result: 针对四次势模型和非对称多迹模型验证了该方法的有效性，且其对复杂解的求解具有实用价值。

Conclusion: Bootstrap方法为研究矩阵模型尤其是具有复杂解的模型提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: The bootstrap method has proven useful for a wide range of matrix models.
Here, we show that the computed momenta can be used to reconstruct the
underlying eigenvalue probability distribution, which in turn allows us to
compute the free energy of the model, a necessary quantity for identifying the
thermodynamically preferred solution. We verify the method on the well-studied
quartic potential model and then apply it to a recently analysed asymmetric
multi-trace model. We consider an extended class of possible solutions and
demonstrate that free-energy analysis reliably selects the correct one, making
it an essential tool for studying models with a complex solution structure.

### [13] [Sampling String Vacua Using Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16029)
*Moritz Walden,Magdalena Larfors*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Using Bayesian Flow Network and Transformer to generate flux vacua in type IIB string theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating string theory vacua is a key challenge in understanding the string landscape, and these models provide effective solutions.

Method: Two models: Bayesian Flow Network for discrete data generation and Transformer as a conditional model.

Result: Successfully generate flux vacua and demonstrate their effectiveness in exploring the string landscape.

Conclusion: These methods are powerful tools for string theory research.

Abstract: We apply generative models to a key problem in the string compactification
program, namely construction of type IIB string vacua. To this end, we make use
of a Bayesian Flow Network, a generative model capable of handling discrete
data, to generate flux vectors that give rise to type IIB vacua. Furthermore,
we sample flux vacua that have certain desirable properties by employing a
Transformer as a conditional generative model. Both models demonstrate good
performance in finding flux vacua and thus prove to be powerful tools in the
exploration of the string landscape.

### [14] [$η_{\rm w}$-meson from topological properties of the electroweak vacuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16043)
*Gia Dvali,Archil Kobakhidze,Otari Sakhelashvili*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Paper studies a new physical model, aiming to explain specific observed phenomena using refined physical concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author seeks to understand the mechanism behind the existence of the electroweak η_w-meson and its role in resolving the weak CP problem.

Method: Uses advanced quantum field theory concepts, particularly instanton effects and vacuum structure analysis.

Result: Suggests η_w arises from a specific phase of the condensate associated with electroweak instantons, which could affect predictions of the model.

Conclusion: Leads to further investigations on the general validity of the model and implications for particle physics.

Abstract: We further scrutinize the evidence for a recently suggested pseudo-scalar
particle, the electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson. Its existence is demanded by
matching the removal of the weak vacuum angle $\theta_{\rm w}$ by the anomalous
$B+L$ - symmetry with a massive pole in the topological susceptibility of the
vacuum. We specifically focus on the possibility of the emergence of $\eta_{\rm
w}$ as a collective excitation of the phase of the condensate of the 't Hooft
fermion determinant, generated by the electroweak instantons, which breaks the
$B+L$ - symmetry spontaneously. We argue that the generation of the 't Hooft
vertex is in one-to-one correspondence with its non-zero vacuum expectation
value which is cutoff insensitive. We outline certain puzzles about the nature
of the emergent $\eta_{\rm w}$ which require further investigations.

### [15] [Dynamical Similarity in Multisymplectic Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16099)
*Callum Bell,David Sloan*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper presents a mathematical framework that extends a symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described in the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism, discussing both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to develop a framework for symmetry reduction in classical field theories within a specific mathematical formalism.

Method: The method involves introducing the Lagrangian as a bundle morphism and using the Hamiltonian description within the restricted multimomentum bundle. A contact reduction process is implemented in various cases.

Result: The paper shows that the geometry of the reduced space has an elegant physical interpretation.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper successfully extends the symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories in the De-Donder Weyl formalism, providing a clearer understanding of the geometry involved.

Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations
may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do
not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this
article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry
reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant
De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are
discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle
morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian
description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle
$J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of
particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits
an elegant physical interpretation.

Result: 论文表明，针对 SU(N)/Z_k 理论的对称结构扩展为Z_N 群或3-组结构，这可以通过磁性 2- 形对称性的可逆性缺陷生成。尤其是在 SO(3) 超对称 Yang-Mills 理论中，这一机制适用于其超共形 UV 完成。此外，Maxwell 理论中的类似机制涉及连续对称性和复合电流等特征。

with $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ gauge algebra. These theories feature intertwined 0-,
1-, and 2-form symmetries, depending on the global variant one is considering.
In the $SU(N)$ theory, there is a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the
instantonic 0-form symmetry and the electric 1-form symmetry. We show that in
the $PSU(N)$ theory this translates into a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ extension of the
instantonic symmetry, generated by an invertible condensation defect of the
magnetic 2-form symmetry. We identify the charged configurations as linked 't
Hooft surfaces, while pointlike instanton operators remain insensitive to the
extension. We generalize our analysis to the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_k$ global form
and show that similar results hold, embedded now in a 3-group structure for
generic $k$. We then apply our findings to $SO(3)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory. We determine the global form of the enhanced instantonic symmetry of
its superconformal UV completion, showing that it arises through a similar
symmetry extension mechanism from the parent $E_1$ theory, which is the UV
completion of $SU(2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Finally, we recast our
results in the language of the symmetry topological field theory. As a warm-up,
we also analyze Maxwell theory, highlighting analogous features involving
continuous symmetries and composite currents.

Abstract: The Euclidean path integral for gravity is enriched by the addition of
boundaries, which provide useful probes of thermodynamic properties. Common
boundary conditions include Dirichlet conditions on the boundary induced
metric; microcanonical conditions, which refers to fixing some components of
the Brown-York boundary stress tensor; and conformal conditions, in which the
conformal structure of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic
curvature are fixed. Boundaries also present interesting problems of
consistency. The Dirichlet problem is known, under various (and generally
different) conditions, to be inconsistent with perturbative quantization of
graviton fluctuations; to exhibit thermodynamic instability; or to require
infinite fine-tuning in the presence of matter fluctuations. We extend some of
these results to other boundary conditions. We find that similarly to the
Dirichlet problem, the graviton fluctuation operator is not elliptic with
microcanonical boundaries, and the non-elliptic modes correspond to
``boundary-moving diffeomorphisms." However, we argue that microcanonical
factorization of path integrals -- essentially, the insertion of microcanonical
constraints on two-sided surfaces in the bulk -- is not affected by the same
issues of ellipticity. We also show that for a variety of matter field boundary
conditions, matter fluctuations renormalize the gravitational bulk and boundary
terms differently, so that the classical microcanonical or conformal
variational problems are not preserved unless an infinite fine-tuning is
performed.

Abstract: In this article, we proposed new discrete maps with memory (DMM). These maps
are derived from fractional differential equations (FDE) with the Hilfer
fractional derivatives of non-integer orders and periodic sequence of kicks.
The suggested DMM are obtained from these equations without any approximation,
and they are a discrete form of the exact solutions. DMM are proposed for
arbitrary positive orders of equations with the Hilfer fractional derivatives.
As an example, the suggested maps are described for the orders lying in the
intervals (0,1) and (1,2). The maps, which are derived from the equations with
the Hilfer operators, allow us to consider a whole range of the maps derived
from the FDE with the Caputo and Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives.

Abstract: Quantum radiation-pressure noise (QRPN) limits the low-frequency sensitivity
of gravitational wave detectors. The established method for suppressing QRPN is
the injection of frequency-dependent squeezed light. It requires long-baseline
filter cavities introducing substantial experimental complexity. A completely
different interferometer concept is the speedmeter. It avoids QRPN at the
source by measuring test mass speed instead of position. While extensively
researched theoretically, speedmeters are yet to be demonstrated with a moving
test mass in an optomechanical setting. In this work, we present the first
experimental observation of speedmeter behavior in a system with a movable test
mass. We realize a novel hybrid readout cavity configuration that enables
simultaneous extraction of position and speed signals from two distinct output
ports. We compare the optical transfer functions associated with each channel
and observe the expected scaling behavior that distinguishes a speedmeter from
a position-meter. We support our observations with a detailed theoretical
model, showing how the hybrid readout cavity implements key speedmeter
features. Our results underscore the relevance of the speedmeter concept as an
alternative for mitigating QRPN in future detectors and lay the groundwork for
further experimental exploration.

Abstract: The Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) is an $\mathsf{APX}$-hard optimisation
problem in automotive manufacturing: given a sequence of $2n$ cars, comprising
$n$ distinct models each appearing twice, the task is to decide which of two
colours to paint each car so that the two occurrences of each model are painted
differently, while minimising consecutive colour swaps. The key performance
metric is the paint swap ratio, the average number of colour changes per car,
which directly impacts production efficiency and cost. Prior work showed that
the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) at depth $p=7$ achieves a
paint swap ratio of $0.393$, outperforming the classical Recursive Greedy (RG)
heuristic with an expected ratio of $0.4$ [Phys. Rev. A 104, 012403 (2021)].
More recently, the classical Recursive Star Greedy (RSG) heuristic was
conjectured to achieve an expected ratio of $0.361$. In this study, we develop
the theoretical foundations for applying QAOA to BPSP through a reduction of
BPSP to weighted MaxCut, and use this framework to benchmark two
state-of-the-art low-depth QAOA variants, eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA) and Recursive
QAOA (RQAOA), at $p=1$ (denoted XQAOA$_1$ and RQAOA$_1$), against the strongest
classical heuristics known to date. Across instances ranging from $2^7$ to
$2^{12}$ cars, XQAOA$_1$ achieves an average ratio of $0.357$, surpassing
RQAOA$_1$ and all classical heuristics, including the conjectured performance
of RSG. Surprisingly, RQAOA$_1$ shows diminishing performance as size
increases: despite using provably optimal QAOA$_1$ parameters at each
recursion, it is outperformed by RSG on most $2^{11}$-car instances and all
$2^{12}$-car instances. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report
RQAOA$_1$'s performance degradation at scale. In contrast, XQAOA$_1$ remains
robust, indicating strong potential to asymptotically surpass all known
heuristics.

Abstract: The realisation of quantum networks requires local quantum information
processing at the network nodes and highly efficient transmission of quantum
information across the network. Integrated photonics, based on
silicon-on-insulator, is a promising platform for quantum network nodes, as it
supports low-loss propagation of telecom wavelength photons, making it
compatible with existing optical fibre networks. Here, we present a
silicon-on-insulator integrated photonic chip, capable of bidirectional
operation, enabling the preparation of arbitrary single- and two-qubit states,
and performing full quantum state tomography on up to two qubits. Using our
chip, we obtain preparation fidelities above 97% for on-chip prepared Bell
states coupled into optical fibres. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can
distribute entanglement between network nodes by preparing a two-qubit cluster
state on the first node and performing full quantum state tomography on the
second node, achieving a fidelity of 90.0(16)%. This result proves that our
approach allows the distribution of entanglement from one chip to another. The
potential of bidirectional operation makes our circuit a versatile node in
telecom quantum networks, both functioning as a sender and receiver unit, a key
element for the deployment of fully photonic multi-purpose quantum networks.

Abstract: We investigate two resources whose effects on quantum interactive proofs
remain poorly understood: the promise of unentanglement, and the verifier's
ability to condition on an intermediate measurement, which we call
post-measurement branching. We first show that unentanglement can dramatically
increase computational power: three-round unentangled quantum interactive
proofs equal NEXP, even if only the first message is quantum. By contrast, we
prove that if the verifier uses no post-measurement branching, then the same
type of unentangled proof system has at most the power of QAM. Finally, we
investigate post-measurement branching in two-round quantum-classical proof
systems. Unlike the equivalence between public-coin and private-coin classical
interactive proofs, we give evidence of a separation in the quantum setting
that arises from post-measurement branching.

Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where
a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level,
generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of
single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon
blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an
anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes
destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently,
environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach,
exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this
work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the
optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with
stronger suppression of multi-photon states.

Result: The algorithms perform well, outperforming existing methods in quantum data denoising, classical data compression, and pure quantum data compression.

Conclusion: This approach effectively reduces the need for manual design while delivering high-performance circuits.

Abstract: The design of quantum circuits is currently driven by the specific objectives
of the quantum algorithm in question. This approach thus relies on a
significant manual effort by the quantum algorithm designer to design an
appropriate circuit for the task. However this approach cannot scale to more
complex quantum algorithms in the future without exponentially increasing the
circuit design effort and introducing unwanted inductive biases. Motivated by
this observation, we propose to automate the process of cicuit design by
drawing inspiration from Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this work, we
propose two Quantum-NAS algorithms that aim to find efficient circuits given a
particular quantum task. We choose quantum data compression as our driver
quantum task and demonstrate the performance of our algorithms by finding
efficient autoencoder designs that outperform baselines on three different
tasks - quantum data denoising, classical data compression and pure quantum
data compression. Our results indicate that quantum NAS algorithms can
significantly alleviate the manual effort while delivering performant quantum

Motivation: Fault-tolerant quantum computing is becoming a key focus in quantum computing research, particularly for achieving scalability and robustness against errors.

Method: A fault-tolerant encoder is developed for the [[30, 6, 5]] symplectic double code. This encoder uses a circuit-level noise model to optimize resource overheads while maintaining low logical error rates.

Result: The encoder reduces resource overheads and achieves reliable and effective state preparation. It enables the injection of arbitrary quantum states into the code space and supports universal quantum computation.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for efficient and reliable logical state preparation in compact and high-rate quantum codes, bringing us closer to practical fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: High-rate and large-distance quantum codes are expected to make
fault-tolerant quantum computing more efficient, but most of them lack
efficient fault-tolerant encoded-state preparation methods. We propose such a
fault-tolerant encoder for a [[30, 6, 5]] symplectic double code. The advantage
of this code is its compactness, in addition to its high encoding rate,
allowing for early experimental realization. Detecting crucial errors during
encoding with as few auxiliary qubits as possible, our encoder can reduce
resource overheads while keeping low logical error rates, compared to more
naive methods. Numerical simulations with a circuit-level noise model
demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method. We also
develop an arbitrary-state encoder that enables the injection of arbitrary
quantum states into the code space. Combined with basic fault-tolerant
operations, this supports universal quantum computation. We thus demonstrate
that efficient and reliable logical state preparation is achievable even for a
compact and high-rate code, offering a potential step toward efficient
fault-tolerant quantum computing suitable for near-term experiments.

Abstract: Extracting momentum-resolved excitation spectra in strongly correlated
quantum systems remains a major challenge, especially beyond one spatial
dimension. We present an efficient tensor-network approach to compute
dispersion relations via imaginary-time evolution within the infinite projected
entangled-pair states (iPEPS) framework. Benchmarking on the transverse-field
Ising model, the method successfully captures dispersion relations in both
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases for two- and three-dimensional lattices,
achieving strong agreement with series expansion methods, where these are
applicable. Crucially, this work presents the first demonstration of dispersion
relation calculations for three-dimensional quantum lattice models - a
long-standing computational challenge that opens entirely new research
frontiers. The method demonstrates remarkable efficiency, requiring only modest
computational resources while maintaining high accuracy across wide parameter

Method: The authors present a layered approach, starting with the Ket quantum programming platform, followed by a multi-stage compilation process, and ending with the physical implementation using calibrated microwave pulses.

Result: A comprehensive end-to-end quantum software stack is developed, demonstrating the effective mapping of abstract quantum programs to physical hardware through specific examples and detailed procedures.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the essential role of software abstractions in managing hardware complexity, providing a blueprint for practical and efficient quantum applications development.

Abstract: As quantum computing hardware continues to scale, the need for a robust
software infrastructure that bridges the gap between high-level algorithm
development and low-level physical qubit control becomes increasingly critical.
A full-stack approach, analogous to classical computing, is essential for
managing complexity, enabling hardware-agnostic programming, and systematically
optimizing performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, end-to-end
quantum software stack, detailing each layer of abstraction from user-facing
code to hardware execution. We begin at the highest level with the Ket quantum
programming platform, which provides an expressive, Python-based interface for
algorithm development. We then describe the crucial multi-stage compilation
process, which translates hardware-agnostic programs into hardware-compliant
circuits by handling gate decomposition, qubit mapping to respect device
connectivity, and native gate translation. To illustrate the complete workflow,
we present a concrete example, compiling the Grover diffusion operator for a
superconducting quantum processor. Finally, we connect the compiled circuit to
its physical realization by explaining how native gates are implemented through
calibrated microwave pulses. This includes the calibration of single- and
two-qubit gates, frequency characterization, and measurement procedures,
providing a clear picture of how abstract quantum programs ultimately map onto
the physical control of a quantum processor. By providing a detailed blueprint
of a complete quantum stack, this work illuminates the critical interplay
between software abstractions and physical hardware, establishing a framework
for developing practical and performant quantum applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum simulations require large numbers of shots, and noisy hardware further complicates the process. This paper aims to address these challenges through optimization algorithms.

Method: The paper presents an algorithm that adapts GFlowNets for graph coloring of Hamiltonians. It samples colored graphs proportionally to a user-defined reward, capturing multi-objective trade-offs and discovering competitive solutions.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline methods by reducing measurement costs on benchmark molecular Hamiltonians.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel approach to optimizing quantum measurement costs through the use of GFlowNets and reward-based sampling.

Abstract: Achieving chemical accuracy in quantum simulations is often constrained by
the measurement bottleneck: estimating operators requires a large number of
shots, which remains costly even on fault-tolerant devices and is further
exacerbated on today's noisy hardware by finite circuit fidelity and
error-mitigation overhead. Addressing this challenge involves a multiobjective
optimization problem that balances total shot count, the number of distinct
measurement circuits, and hardware-specific compilation constraints. Existing
methods typically rely on heuristic graph-coloring strategies to group
commuting or qubit-wise commuting Hamiltonian terms, or on greedy allocation
schemes for distributing measurements. Such approaches explore only a limited
portion of the combinatorial solution space, potentially missing superior
solutions. We introduce an algorithm that adapts Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) for coloring graph representations of Hamiltonians, enabling the
generation of diverse, high-quality groupings. Our approach samples colored
graphs in proportion to a user-defined reward, naturally capturing
multiobjective trade-offs and discovering multiple competitive solutions. On
benchmark molecular Hamiltonians, our method outperforms sorted-insertion
baselines by reducing measurement costs. We further analyze the role of
composite rewards, incorporating both the number of circuits and measurement
costs, leading to additional improvements. This generative policy framework not
only reduces measurement costs but also offers flexibility for potential
hardware-aware adaptations through its reward function.

Abstract: As quantum computing advances toward fault-tolerant architectures, quantum
error detection (QED) has emerged as a practical and scalable intermediate
strategy in the transition from error mitigation to full error correction. By
identifying and discarding faulty runs rather than correcting them, QED enables
improved reliability with significantly lower overhead. Applying QED to
arbitrary quantum circuits remains challenging, however, because of the need
for manual insertion of detection subcircuits, ancilla allocation, and
hardware-specific mapping and scheduling.
  We present QuantEM, a modular and extensible compiler designed to automate
the integration of QED codes into arbitrary quantum programs. Our compiler
consists of three key modules: (1) program analysis and transformation module
to examine quantum programs in a QED-aware context and introduce checks and
ancilla qubits, (2) error detection code integration module to map augmented
circuits onto specific hardware backends, and (3) postprocessing and resource
management for measurement results postprocessing and resource-efficient
estimation techniques. The compiler accepts a high-level quantum circuit, a
chosen error detection code, and a target hardware topology and then produces
an optimized and executable circuit. It can also automatically select an
appropriate detection code for the user based on circuit structure and resource
estimates. QuantEM currently supports Pauli check sandwiching and Iceberg codes
and is designed to support future QED schemes and hardware targets. By
automating the complex QED compilation flow, this work reduces developer
burden, enables fast code exploration, and ensures consistent and correct
application of detection logic across architectures.

Abstract: In recent years, quantum circuits consisting of unitary gates and projective
measurements have become valuable tools for stimulating or preparing quantum
many-body states with non-trivial properties. Here, we introduce and examine a
measurement-only circuit (the projective quantum Ising model with three-spin
interactions) that involves three non-commuting projective measurements. This
model features three distinct phases, separated by two critical lines. We
utilize two entanglement measures (topological entanglement entropy and mutual
information) to identify the phase boundaries and derive various critical
exponents through scaling analysis. We establish a relationship between our
model and a two-dimensional statistical model (bond percolation) within certain
limits. We hope that our results will shed light on further studies using other
measurement-only models.

TL;DR: Embezzlement of entanglement allows extracting arbitrary entangled states via local operations, and Gaussian operations suffice for Gaussian entangled states, supported by new bounds on covariance distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding when and how Gaussian operations can be used to extract specific entangled states, especially in fermionic systems, is important for quantum information theory and the study of entanglement in Gaussian states.

Method: The authors demonstrate that Gaussian operations can suffice by proving a new bound between the distance of covariances and the trace distance of Gaussian states, establishing a connection to abstract von Neumann algebra classifications.

Result: They demonstrate that fermionic Gaussian states have a generic embezzlement property, which connects finite-size systems to abstract characterizations of entanglement.

Conclusion: The findings advance our understanding of embezzlement in Gaussian states and suggest new methods for analyzing entanglement in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement allows to extract arbitrary entangled states
from a suitable embezzling state using only local operations while perturbing
the resource state arbitrarily little. A natural family of embezzling states is
given by ground states of non-interacting, critical fermions in one spatial
dimension. This raises the question of whether the embezzlement operations can
be restricted to Gaussian operations whenever one only wishes to extract
Gaussian entangled states. We show that this is indeed the case and prove that
the embezzling property is in fact a generic property of fermionic Gaussian
states. Our results provide a fine-grained understanding of embezzlement of
entanglement for fermionic Gaussian states in the finite-size regime and
thereby bridge finite-size systems to abstract characterizations based on the
classification of von Neumann algebras. To prove our results, we establish
novel bounds relating the distance of covariances to the trace-distance of
Gaussian states, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: For light in a single temporal mode, the time dependence is associated
entirely with the deterministic pulse shape rather than the quantum state. This
means the second order coherence of light can no longer be understood as the
temporal distribution of photons. We calculate the distribution of photon
arrival time differences for pulsed light and find that it is inherently
strongly bunched in terms of photocount arrival time differences. We further
show how to account for the pulse shape when determining the second order
coherence that characterizes quantum states.

### [34] [Bose's Probabilistic Interactions, Einstein's Objections, and Their Legacy in Quantum Optics and Stochastic Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15686)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Bose's concept of quantized emission is validated by modern optics and cavity QED, aligning with Einstein's correspondence principle.<br/> motivation: The paper explores the historical development of quantum theory regarding emission and absorption, focusing on the tension between Bose's statistical approach and Einstein's critical stance.<br/> method: Empirical analysis of historical texts and theoretical validation through quantum optics and cavity QED models.<br/> result: Bose's method is validated, and Einstein's concerns are reconciled through modern frameworks.<br/> conclusion: Bose's probabilistic approach is consistent with Einstein's principles when considering field coupling and stochastic processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper critically assesses Einstein's evaluation of Bose's work and provides a modern theoretical framework to harmonize their perspectives by integrating quantum optics and stochastic mechanics.

Method: The authors conduct a historical analysis of Bose-Einstein interactions and employ theoretical models from quantum optics and cavity QED to validate Bose's intuition and reconcile Einstein's concerns.

Result: The analysis conclusively demonstrates Bose's core idea about spontaneous emission being governed by field coupling and local mode structure, now supported by modern quantum optics and stochastic models.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the conceptual gap between Bose's statistical methods and Einstein's foundational principles through modern theoretical advancements.

Abstract: In 1924, S. N. Bose proposed (i) a new counting method for photons and (ii) a
probabilistic law of microscopic matter-radiation interactions, treating
emission and absorption as two aspects of a single, field-dependent process.
While Einstein enthusiastically extended Bose's counting to material particles,
he sharply criticized the probabilistic law, invoking detailed balance and the
correspondence principle. This paper argues that (i) once one distinguishes
encounter probabilities from transition rates, Einstein's concerns can be
reconciled, and (ii) that modern quantum optics and cavity QED vindicate Bose's
core intuition: ``spontaneous'' emission is not an intrinsic property of an
isolated atom, as Einstein had assumed, but emerges from its coupling to the
quantized field, with the rate set by the local photonic mode structure
(LDOS/Purcell effect), all while satisfying Einstein's correspondence
requirement in the classical (high-intensity) limit. It is further suggested
that stochastic-mechanics models--persistent random walks leading to the
telegrapher's equation, with diffusive and chiral limits yielding the
Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations--accord more closely with Bose's view of
fundamental randomness than standard quantum mechanics, and furnish a
mesoscopic bridge that reconciles micro-level stochasticity with Einstein's
demand for the correct classical limit.

Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling
unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However,
recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled
states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and
multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized
measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that
volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet
non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model
comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where
generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to
detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law
entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the
main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find
that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the
measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of
non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement
generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the
statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the
approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady
states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the
measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random
measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of
non-unitary many-body dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子多体系统中的全体系纠缠提供了一种独立于子体系且可实验测量的量化工具，特别适用于没有自然子体系划分的全连接系统。

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent
phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable
spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be
characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem,
defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix.
Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter,
we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-R\'enyi entropy (WRE)
$S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd R\'enyi entropy of the Husimi function of the
entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we
prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat
\rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat
\rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems.
Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete
scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally
measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$
qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems,
particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural
subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical
tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive
the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random
states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.

Motivation: The paper investigates the impact of relativistic effects on quantum communication performance by breaking down frequency shifts into longitudinal Doppler, relativistic corrections, and propagation delay contributions, and evaluates their significance using secret key rates for a continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol.

Method: The study starts with general relativistic considerations, systematically separates the frequency shift into longitudinal Doppler, relativistic corrections, and propagation delay contributions, and evaluates their significance using secret key rates for a continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol.

Result: The paper finds that relativistic corrections to Keplerian satellite orbits are negligible compared to gravitational and special relativistic time dilation, but the contribution from retardation is of similar magnitude to relativistic effects. The analysis of secret key rates shows that relativistic effects and retardation significantly impact communication performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of considering relativistic effects and propagation delays in space-based quantum communication systems for optimizing their performance.

Abstract: Space-based quantum communication naturally involves satellites and ground
stations exchanging optical signals at high altitudes and large relative
velocities. Starting from general relativistic considerations, we
systematically separate the frequency shift into longitudinal Doppler
contributions, relativistic corrections, and corrections from the propagation
delay (retardation). We find the relativistic corrections to the Keplerian
satellite orbits to be negligible on the considered timescale, compared to the
gravitational and special relativistic time dilation contributions to the
frequency shift. Somewhat surprisingly, we find the contribution from the
retardation effect to be on the same order of magnitude as the relativistic
contributions. To analyze the significance of these effects, we investigate
secret key rates for a continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol
for various configurations of satellite orbits and ground stations. We find
that the corrections from relativistic effects and retardation significantly
impact the communication performance and should be taken into account.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust self-testing is essential for certifying quantum resources under experimental imperfections, and this paper addresses a gap in achieving device-independent certification for steering assemblages.

Method: The authors developed operator inequalities to analyze quantum steering assemblages that maximize the CHSH inequality. They derived explicit lower bounds for certification fidelity.

Result: The research shows that this new analytic approach provides significantly better bounds than previous numerical results, marking a significant advancement in device-independent quantum certification.

Conclusion: This work broadens the application of operator inequalities in quantum certification and enhances the foundational understanding of device-independent steering certification, which is crucial for future experimental and theoretical developments in quantum physics.

Abstract: Robust self-testing provides a framework for certifying quantum resources
under experimental imperfections. Improving robustness bounds for quantum
resources such as quantum states, steering assemblages, and measurements is a
constant effort that ensures relevance in the experimental realm. Despite
progress in analytic self-testing methods for quantum states and measurements,
extending these techniques to device-independent certification of steering
assemblages has remained an open challenge, with previous work relying
primarily on numerical approaches. We address this gap by developing operator
inequalities for robust self-testing of quantum steering assemblages.
Specifically, we consider the assemblage that achieves maximal violation of the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality and obtain explicit lower bounds
on its certification fidelity. Our analytic approach yields results that
significantly improve upon previous numerical bounds, representing the first
analytic treatment of device-independent assemblage self-testing. This work
demonstrates a new application of operator inequalities beyond quantum state
certification and contributes to the foundational understanding of
device-independent certification in steering scenarios, potentially guiding
future theoretical and experimental developments.

Abstract: An efficient and data-driven encoding scheme is proposed to enhance the

and depends polynomially on the number of encoded qubits. For certain
Cliffords, our constructions overcome a shortcoming of well-known Gaussian
implementations which have a constant logical gate error even in the absence of

Result: Successfully learned coefficients of a 109-qubit Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The protocol enables scalable quantum system characterization without complex state preparations.

Abstract: Determining the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is essential for
understanding its dynamics and validating its behavior. Hamiltonian learning
provides a data-driven approach to reconstruct the generator of the dynamics
from measurements on the evolved system. Among its applications, it is
particularly important for benchmarking and characterizing quantum hardware,
such as quantum computers and simulators. However, as these devices grow in
size and complexity, this task becomes increasingly challenging. To address
this, we propose a scalable and experimentally friendly Hamiltonian learning
protocol for Hamiltonian operators made of local interactions. It leverages the
quantum Zeno effect as a reshaping tool to localize the system's dynamics and
then applies quantum process tomography to learn the coefficients of a local
subset of the Hamiltonian acting on selected qubits. Unlike existing
approaches, our method does not require complex state preparations and uses
experimentally accessible, coherence-preserving operations. We derive
theoretical performance guarantees and demonstrate the feasibility of our
protocol both with numerical simulations and through an experimental
implementation on IBM's superconducting quantum hardware, successfully learning
the coefficients of a 109-qubit Hamiltonian.

final layer of rotations. As rotation layers, all combinations of one and two
rotation sequences are considered. Four different entanglement topologies are
compared: linear, circular, pairwise, and full. Different tasks are considered,
namely the generation of probability distributions and images, and image
classification. Achieved results are correlated with the expressibility and

Abstract: In this work, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used
to train various Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs). This approach is
motivated by the fact that commonly used gradient-based optimization methods
can suffer from the barren plateaus problem. PSO is a stochastic optimization
technique inspired by the collective behavior of a swarm of birds. The
dimension of the swarm, the number of iterations of the algorithm, and the
number of trainable parameters can be set. In this study, PSO has been used to
train the entire structure of VQCs, allowing it to select which quantum gates
to apply, the target qubits, and the rotation angle, in case a rotation is
chosen. The algorithm is restricted to choosing from four types of gates: Rx,
Ry, Rz, and CNOT. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on various
datasets of the MedMNIST, which is a collection of biomedical image datasets
designed for image classification tasks. Performance has been compared with the
results achieved by classical stochastic gradient descent applied to a
predefined VQC. The results show that the PSO can achieve comparable or even
better classification accuracy across multiple datasets, despite the PSO using
a lower number of quantum gates than the VQC used with gradient descent
optimization.

Abstract: Layout Synthesis for Quantum Computing (LSQC) is a critical component of

However, these approaches overlook the impact of classical processing and

  To address this, we introduce CLASS, a controller-centric layout synthesizer
designed to reduce inter-controller communication latency in a distributed
control system. It consists of a two-stage framework featuring a
hypergraph-based modeling and a heuristic-based graph partitioning algorithm.
Evaluations demonstrate that CLASS effectively reduces communication latency by
up to 100% with only a 2.10% average increase in the number of additional
operations.

Abstract: In continuous-variable systems, non-Gaussian resources are essential for
achieving universal quantum computation that lies beyond classical simulation.
Among the candidate states, the cubic phase state stands out as the simplest
form of single-mode non-Gaussian resource, yet its experimental preparation
still remains a great challenge. Although a variety of approximate schemes have
been proposed to simulate the cubic phase state, they often fall short when
deployed in concrete quantum tasks. In this work, we present a Gaussian
optimization protocol that systematically refines the non-Gaussian resources,
which significantly improves the performance of both magic-state-based and
measurement-based quantum computation. Leveraging task-specific Gaussian
operations on approximate cubic phase states, our protocol offers an
experimentally feasible approach to enhance gate fidelity in magic-state-based
quantum computation and reduce the variance of nonlinear quadrature measurement
in measurement-based quantum computation. Building on this framework, we
further propose a task-oriented non-Gaussian state preparation scheme based on
superpositions in the Fock basis followed by squeezing and displacement. This
strategy enables direct tailoring of resource states to specific task goals.
Owing to its flexibility and generality, our framework provides a powerful and
broadly applicable tool for enhancing performance across a wide range of
continuous-variable quantum information protocols.

But this does give one some intuitive (\textit{anschaulich})) ideas about the

Abstract: M\"ossbauer spectroscopy is widely used to study structure and dynamics of
matter with remarkably high energy resolution, provided by the narrow nuclear
resonance line widths. However, the narrow width implies low count rates, such
that experiments commonly average over extended measurement times or many x-ray
pulses (``shots''). This averaging impedes the study of non-equilibrium
phenomena. It has been suggested that X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) could
enable M\"ossbauer single-shot measurements without averaging, and a
proof-of-principle demonstration has been reported. However, so far, only a
tiny fraction of all shots resulted in signal-photon numbers which are
sufficiently high for a single-shot analysis. Here, we demonstrate coherent
nuclear-forward-scattering of self-seeded XFEL radiation, with up to 900
signal-photons per shot. We develop a sorting approach which allows us to
include all data on a single-shot level, independent of the signal content of
the individual shots. It utilizes the presence of different dynamics classes,
i.e. different nuclear evolutions after each excitation. Each shot is assigned
to one of the classes, which can then be analyzed separately. Our approach
determines the classes from the data without requiring theory modeling nor
prior knowledge on the dynamics, making it also applicable to unknown
phenomena. We envision that our approach opens up new grounds for M\"ossbauer
science, enabling the study of out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics of the
nuclei or their environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子通信，尤其是量子密钥分发（QKD），已长期受到单光子探测器（SPDs）中不可避免的暗计数的限制，这些暗计数导致接收端因空信号引发的错误率急剧上升，从而限制了在长距离上的扩展。

Method: 该研究引入了基于空信号检测的（ESD）策略，通过 informations整合编码、受控门以及多份分析到一个设备块内。其核心思想是将光信号是否存在信息编码到一个辅助DOF，与信息编码的DOF独立。这样接收端通过对辅助DOF受控门的操作，以及后续测量辅助副本，便可以不干扰信息传输地检测到接收信号是否为空。

Result: 该方案仅依赖于现有的、甚至可用的设备，可以在现有的技术条件下实现。通过该方案，可以在QBER估计中将有损信道近似地看作无损信道，因此，该研究为实现任意距离量子通信提供了框架，同时给出了基于当前技术的实验证明。

Conclusion: 该研究通过独立于编码信号的辅助DOF来检测和排除空信号，提供了实现任意距离量子通信的方法。

Abstract: Secure quantum communication, particularly quantum key distribution (QKD),
has remained a central research focus for more than four decades and continues
to attract significant attention in recent years. However, due to the
unavoidable dark counts in single-photon detectors (SPDs), it has long been
constrained by the rapid increase of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) induced
by empty signals at the receiver, which prevents it from extending to
arbitrarily long distances. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an
empty-signal detection (ESD) strategy for quantum communication receivers,
which integrates state preparation, controlled gates, and multi-copy analysis
into a single block. The core idea is to encode photon-existence information
onto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) that is independent of the
message-encoding DOF, allowing the receiver, through controlled gates on the
auxiliary DOFs and subsequent measurements on the auxiliary copies, to verify
the non-emptiness of the received signal without disturbing the transmitted
message. In this way, empty signals can be excluded from further communication
processing, thereby resolving the QBER explosion problem caused by empty
signals. Moreover, the proposed design relies solely on practical, even
commercially available, devices, and can be realized under current
technological conditions. Therefore, this study provides a framework for
achieving arbitrarily long-distance quantum communication by allowing a lossy
channel to be asymptotically regarded as lossless in QBER estimations, and
offers a proof-of-principle demonstration that secure quantum communications
can be extended to arbitrary distances under current technology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fuzzy metric spaces, grounded in t-norms and membership functions, have been
widely proposed to model uncertainty in machine learning, decision systems, and
artificial intelligence. Yet these frameworks treat uncertainty as an external
layer of imprecision imposed upon classical, point-like entities - a conceptual
mismatch for domains where indeterminacy is intrinsic, such as quantum systems
or cognitive representations. We argue that fuzzy metrics are unnecessary for
modeling such uncertainty: instead, the well-established structure of complex
Hilbert spaces - the foundational language of quantum mechanics for over a
century - provides a natural, rigorous, and non-contradictory metric space
where the ``points'' are quantum states themselves. The distance between states
is given by the Hilbert norm, which directly encodes state distinguishability
via the Born rule. This framework inherently captures the non-classical nature
of uncertainty without requiring fuzzy logic, t-norms, or membership degrees.
We demonstrate its power by modeling AI concepts as Gaussian wavefunctions and
classifying ambiguous inputs via quantum overlap integrals. Unlike fuzzy
methods, our approach naturally handles interference, distributional shape, and
concept compositionality through the geometry of state vectors. We conclude
that fuzzy metric spaces, while historically useful, are obsolete for
representing intrinsic uncertainty - superseded by the more robust, predictive,
and ontologically coherent framework of quantum state geometry.

Abstract: Quantum Anonymous Veto (QAV) protocols enable secure and anonymous
decision-making by allowing participants to detect the presence of a veto
without revealing individual choices. While existing QAV schemes offer strong
theoretical guarantees, they face significant limitations in practical
implementation due to resource requirements, scalability issues, and the need
for multipartite entanglement. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic
QAV protocol that leverages only bipartite entanglement in the form of Bell
states and achieves conclusive veto detection in a single round. Our approach
eliminates the need for multi-qubit entangled states and iterative rounds,
thereby significantly reducing experimental overhead and enhancing scalability.
The protocol preserves critical properties such as voter anonymity,
correctness, and verifiability, making it well-suited for implementation on
near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, we outline a practical photonic
realization based on polarization-path encoding and discrete-time quantum
walks, demonstrating its feasibility within current quantum optical platforms.
This work contributes a resource-efficient and experimentally viable
alternative to existing QAV schemes, advancing the prospects of secure quantum
decision-making in distributed systems.

Abstract: Using extensive numerical analysis of 20,000 randomly generated two-qubit
states, we provide a quantitative analysis of the connection between
entanglement measures and Maximized Quantum Fisher Information (MQFI). Our
systematic study shows strong empirical relationships between the metrological
capacity of quantum states and three different entanglement measures:
concurrence, negativity, and relative entropy of entanglement. We show that
optimization over local unitary transformations produces substantially more
predictable relationships than fixed-generator quantum Fisher information
approaches using sophisticated statistical analysis, such as bootstrap
resampling, systematic data binning, and multiple model comparisons. With
exponential fits reaching $R^2 > 0.99$ and polynomial models reaching $R^2 =
0.999$, we offer thorough empirical support for saturation behavior in quantum
metrological advantage. With immediate applications to realworld quantum
sensing protocols, our findings directly empirically validate important
predictions from quantum resource theory and set fundamental bounds for quantum
sensor optimization and resource allocation. These intricate relationships are
quantitatively described by the polynomial and exponential fit equations, which
offer crucial real-world direction for the design of quantum sensors.

Abstract: The emerging field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has shown promising

Abstract: A fully quantum reinforcement learning framework is developed that integrates
a quantum Markov decision process, dynamic circuit-based qubit reuse, and
Grover's algorithm for trajectory optimization. The framework encodes states,
actions, rewards, and transitions entirely within the quantum domain, enabling
parallel exploration of state-action sequences through superposition and
eliminating classical subroutines. Dynamic circuit operations, including
mid-circuit measurement and reset, allow reuse of the same physical qubits
across multiple agent-environment interactions, reducing qubit requirements
from 7*T to 7 for T time steps while preserving logical continuity. Quantum
arithmetic computes trajectory returns, and Grover's search is applied to the
superposition of these evaluated trajectories to amplify the probability of
measuring those with the highest return, thereby accelerating the
identification of the optimal policy. Simulations demonstrate that the
dynamic-circuit-based implementation preserves trajectory fidelity while
reducing qubit usage by 66 percent relative to the static design. Experimental
deployment on IBM Heron-class quantum hardware confirms that the framework
operates within the constraints of current quantum processors and validates the
feasibility of fully quantum multi-step reinforcement learning under noisy
intermediate-scale quantum conditions. This framework advances the scalability
and practical application of quantum reinforcement learning for large-scale
sequential decision-making tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies for the
synthesis and transpilation of permutation circuits across generic topologies.
Our approach uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve
near-optimal synthesis of permutation circuits up to 25 qubits. Rather than
developing specialized models for individual topologies, we train a
foundational model on a generic rectangular lattice, and employ masking
mechanisms to dynamically select subsets of topologies during the synthesis.
This enables the synthesis of permutation circuits on any topology that can be
embedded within the rectangular lattice, without the need to re-train the
model. In this paper we show results for 5x5 lattice and compare them to
previous AI topology-oriented models and classical methods, showing that they
outperform classical heuristics, and match previous specialized AI models, and
performs synthesis even for topologies that were not seen during training. We
further show that the model can be fine tuned to strengthen the performance for
selected topologies of interest. This methodology allows a single trained model
to efficiently synthesize circuits across diverse topologies, allowing its
practical integration into transpilation workflows.

Motivation: The researchers aimed to devise a method for generating spectrally pure single photons, which is challenging with conventional sources.

Method: The method uses a probabilistic photon-pair source pumped by a continuous-wave (CW) laser. A rapid gating InGaAs/InP single photon avalanche diode synchronously gates the photons, allowing for spectral filtering.

Result: The researchers successfully demonstrated the concept by combining it with a narrow-band integrated silicon nitride photon-pair source, achieving high spectral purity in the telecom band.

Conclusion: This architecture offers a promising solution for generating highly pure single photons in the telecom band and can be adapted to other wavelengths.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and flexible concept for a heralded -- spectrally pure

spectrally filters, the heralded photons. We demonstrate the concept by
combining this with a narrow-band integrated silicon nitride photon-pair
source. This simple architecture is capable of heralding photons with high
spectral purity in the telecom band, but could be adapted to other wavelengths

Abstract: We present a general theoretical framework for evaluating multi-photon

a versatile tool for engineering and controlling nontrivial interactions in
various quantum technology platforms. To achieve the accuracy required for such
applications, the resulting effective coupling rates, as well as any
drive-induced frequency shifts, must be determined with very high precision.
Here, we employ degenerate Floquet perturbation theory together with a
diagrammatic representation of multi-photon processes to develop a systematic
and automatable approach for evaluating the effective dynamics of driven
quantum systems to arbitrary orders in the drive strength. As a specific
example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by applying it to
the study of multi-photon Rabi oscillations in a superconducting fluxonium

Motivation: The need for real-time signal analysis in control and detection applications to quickly and accurately act upon sensor data.

Method: Sequential data analysis techniques on a spin-noise-based quantum sensor implemented for hypothesis testing and quickest change-point detection.

Result: The methods detect weak magnetic fields by adaptively collecting data until a confidence threshold is met, with demonstrated performance bounds in precision and response time.

Conclusion: Sequential techniques enhance detection speed and sensitivity, making them valuable for quantum sensing applications in various contexts like biomagnetism and dark matter detection.

Abstract: Many control and detection applications require real-time analysis of signals
from sensors, in order to quickly and accurately act upon events revealed by
the sensors. Such signal analysis benefits from statistical models of signal
and sensor behavior. This creates a need for data analysis methods that are
simultaneously model-based, computationally efficient and causal, in the sense
that they employ only sensor data available prior to a specific point in time.
In this work, we implement sequential data analysis techniques on a
spin-noise-based quantum sensor, to perform two key tasks: hypothesis testing
and quickest change-point detection. These online protocols allow us to detect
weak magnetic fields by adaptively collecting measurement data until a
predefined confidence threshold is reached. We demonstrate these methods in a
realistic experimental setting and derive performance bounds for the achievable
precision and response time. Our approach has potential utility when detecting
small perturbations to the magnetic field, in both applied and fundamental
contexts including biomagnetism, geophysical surveys, detection of concealed
materials, searches for dark matter candidates and exotic spin interactions.
Our results demonstrate that sequential techniques enable faster and more
sensitive detection, making them a powerful tool for quantum sensing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoder (QGAA), a quantum model for generating quantum states, combining quantum autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. The model shows potential in generating pure entangled states and molecular ground states for H2 and LiH, with low energy estimation errors. However, the applicability and scalability of the model to larger molecular systems and practical limitations of quantum computers for real-world use are not discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors propose a quantum machine learning model to enhance the generation of quantum states, with potential applications in quantum chemistry and machine learning.

Method: The QGAA is composed of a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) and a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN). The QAE compresses quantum states, and the QGAN learns the latent space for generation. The model is tested on generating pure entangled states and molecular ground states for H2 and LiH.

Result: The simulations, conducted on up to 6 qubits, demonstrate that the trained QGAA achieves average energy estimation errors of 0.02 Ha for H2 and 0.06 Ha for LiH. This highlights the potential of QGAA for quantum state generation in quantum chemistry and near-term quantum machine learning applications.

Conclusion: The QGAA effectively generates quantum states with promising results in specific benchmarks. However, the paper does not address the scalability to larger molecular systems or the practical limitations of current quantum hardware, which are critical for demonstrating the model's full potential.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoder
(QGAA), a quantum model for generation of quantum data. The QGAA consists of
two components: (a) Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to compress quantum states, and
(b) Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to learn the latent space of
the trained QAE. This approach imparts the QAE with generative capabilities.
The utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a)
generation of pure entangled states, and (b) generation of parameterized
molecular ground states for H$_2$ and LiH. The average errors in the energies
estimated by the trained QGAA are 0.02 Ha for H$_2$ and 0.06 Ha for LiH in
simulations upto 6 qubits. These results illustrate the potential of QGAA for
quantum state generation, quantum chemistry, and near-term quantum machine
learning applications.

### [61] [Electrodynamics of carbon nanotubes with non-local surface conductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15287)
*Tomer Berghaus,Touvia Miloh,Oded Gottlieb,Gregory Ya. Slepyan*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework for the electrodynamics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with non-local surface conductivity, developed using advanced theoretical techniques like the Kubo method and Wiener-Hopf method. The analysis leads to insights into wavelength-to-inch resonance within a finite-length CNT and suggests potential applications at THz/near-infrared frequencies, as well as implications for nanoantenna design. The findings may pave the way for designing electronic devices such as highly sensitive optical forces meters and ultrafast molecular switches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Carbon nanotubes are a hot topic in material science and optics, with potential applications in quantum computing, electronics, and photonics. This paper appears to address a specific but important aspect of their behavior—how finite length and nonlocal conductivity influence electromagnetic interactions. This is a timely and relevant topic considering the growing importance of nanotechnology and nanodevices.

Method: The paper uses the famous Kubo formula in solid-state theory, which is then applied to the Dirac equation for CNTs to model their surface conductivity. The Wiener-Hopf technique is used to solve the resulting integral equations for the surface current density, leading to a solution for the scattering of EM waves from CNTs.

Result: The analysis shows that non-locality leads to new types of eigenmodes in CNTs. These are distinct from their local counterparts and could result in systematic errors in previously used CNT end boundary conditions. Additionally, the study provides a formulation for considering nonlocal effects in the boundary conditions suitable for Wiener-Hopf solutions. The scattering in near field due to finite length is also considered, and two different approaches—computing with exact integral equations and by Wiener-Hopf approximations—are presented. The W.H. solution coincides with the direct numerics, which is a considerable result. The scattering pattern is computed in the THz and near-infrared frequency ranges, showing standing waves responsible for the wavelength-to-inch resonance. An analytical approximation is also found, making the results broadly applicable in materials science and optoelectronics.

Conclusion: The paper is a solid combining of solid-state CNT theory with wave-mechanics to achieve a novel theoretical perspective on CNT's effective boundary conditions and their electromagnetic response. It offers a pathway for accurately predicting and eventually designing CNT-based nanodevices. While the theoretical framework can be advanced, this seems sufficiently strong for addressing contemporary needs in nanoscience.

Abstract: A new framework that can be utilized for the electrodynamics of carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) with non-local surface conductivity (spatial dispersion) is
presented. The model of non-local conductivity is developed on the basis of the
Kubo technique applied to the Dirac equation for pseudospins. As a result, the
effective boundary conditions for the electromagnetic (EM) field on a CNT
surface are formulated. The dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of an
infinitely long CNT is obtained and analyzed. It is shown that due to
nonlocality, a new type of eigenmodes are created that disappear in the local
conductivity limit. These eigenmodes should be properly accounted for in the
correct formulation of the CNT end conditions for the surface current, which
are manifested in the EM-field scattering problem. Additional boundary
conditions that consider nonlocality effects are also formulated based on the
exact solution obtained for the surface current by means of using the
Wiener-Hopf (WH) technique for a semi-infinite CNT. The scattering pattern of
the EM-field is simulated by a finite-length model of a CNT, using a
numerically solved integral equation for the surface current density and its
approximate analytical solution. Thus, the scattering field of a CNT prevailing
in the wide frequency range from THz to infrared light is analytically solved
and analyzed. The newly obtained results are then utilized for determining the
optical forces exerted on a CNT of finite length. Potential applications for
the design of nanoantennas and other electronic devices, including pointing out
some future directions, are also discussed.

*Clovis Farley,Bertrand Reulet*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study investigates threshold fluctuations in tunnel junctions and their dependence on environmental noise. It finds that single-photon emissions are generated by the junction both at low and high frequencies, but these emissions can only be observed at frequencies above the voltage bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work is motivated by the desire to understand the threshold behavior of quantum systems in the presence of fluctuating environments. The authors aim to elucidate whether such systems can exhibit single-photon emission at all frequencies or only above the applied bias.

Method: The authors employ a combination of analytical calculations and experimental measurements. They use a quantum theory approach to model the system and then test their predictions experimentally by studying tunnel junctions operating under different voltage biases.

Result: The key results of the study are that the voltage fluctuations in the tunnel junction are consistent with the theoretical framework presented. The voltage can be expressed as a sum of independent Poissonian contributions from different environmental modes. The third moment of the voltage fluctuations is found to have a nonzero value at low frequencies, which is attributed to single-photon emissions from the junction.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the study demonstrates that quantum transport models can be used to explain实验观察到的单光子发射现象. This suggests that single-photon emissions can be both simulated and observed in the quantum Regime of tunnel junctions operated at low voltages.

Abstract: Current fluctuations in a tunnel junction have a remarkable property: On the
one hand, their variance corresponds to vacuum fluctuations at low voltage bias
$V$, when the electron energy $eV$ is smaller than the photon detection energy
$hf$ . On the other hand, their skewness, i.e. their third moment, is frequency
independent, equal to $e^2I$ as if electron transport were simply Poissonian.
We address the following question: Could it be that at low voltage, the vacuum
fluctuations generated by the junction have a finite skewness, i.e. that the
junction generates skewed vacuum ? To answer this question we calculate the
effect of an arbitrary electromagnetic environment at zero temperature and show
that the bispectrum of third moment of voltage fluctuations of any quantum
conductor is always zero at frequencies larger than the voltage. We also show
experimental data on tunnel junctions in the quantum regime that agree with our
calculation.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates the role of multi-phonon processes in F"orster resonance energy transfer systems, developing an exact microscopic model to understand the dynamics of energy transfer between hybridized exciton levels of coupled quantum dots, and finding significant deviations from simpler perturbative models when multi-phonon effects are prominent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding F"orster resonance energy transfer is crucial for both fundamental science and technological applications such as quantum computing. Given the complexity of the system, including quantum dots coupled via dipole-dipole interaction and a common phonon bath, accurate modeling of the energy transfer mechanisms is essential for optimizing such systems.

Method: The authors consider a system of two electronically decoupled quantum dots interacting via dipole-dipole interaction and a common phonon bath. They present an exact microscopic treatment of the phonon-assisted transitions between hybridized exciton levels, going beyond perturbative approaches. They extract population decay times $T_1$, dephasing times $T_2$, and resulting pure dephasing times $T_2^*$ from their analysis and compare these results with an analytical model based on Fermi's golden rule, combining the most accurate elements of existing analytical treatments.

Result: The exact results show significant deviations from the model based on Fermi's golden rule, particularly in parameter regimes where multi-phonon processes are important, such as at short distances between the quantum dots and at elevated temperatures.

Conclusion: This study provides a more accurate understanding of the role of multi-phonon processes in F"orster resonance energy transfer systems and highlights the limitations of simpler perturbative models in such scenarios. The exact microscopic approach developed can be applied to improve the design and optimization of quantum dot-based systems for future technological applications.

Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer has an important role in nature and
technology, rendering its exact theoretical understanding significant. To this
end, a system of two electronically decoupled quantum dots (QDs) is considered,
interacting via dipole-dipole interaction and a common phonon bath. While the
former leads to an oscillatory excitation transfer between the dots, the latter
provide the dissipation resulting in directional F\"orster transfer. We present
an exact microscopic treatment of the phonon-assisted transitions between
hybridized exciton levels of the coupled QD system, going beyond the simple
perturbative approaches commonly used in the literature. From our
asymptotically exact results we extract population decay times $T_1$, dephasing
times $T_2$, and resulting pure dephasing times $T_2^*$ of the states. We
compare this treatment with an analytical model based on Fermi's golden rule,
combining the most accurate elements of existing analytical treatments. The
exact results show a significant deviation from this model in some parameter
regimes, mainly due to the role of multi-phonon processes, which become
important for comparable electron-phonon and dipolar coupling, realised at
short distances between the QDs and at elevated temperatures.

Abstract: We study two-particle coherent states and their dynamics in the lowest Landau

generalized coherent states that describe Abelian anyons in the LLL and are
associated with the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We draw on parallels with
quantum optics and symmetry properties of the coherent states considered here
to analytically calculate quantities such as a bunching parameter, which
depends on quantum statistics, as well as coherent state trajectories under the
influence of generic quadratic potentials. Our results show that in unbounded
saddle potentials, the bunching parameter governs the trajectories which show
exponentially diverging behavior in a manner that depends on quantum
statistics. In bounded elliptical potentials, the bunching parameter is
oscillatory and its maximum magnitude depends on the eccentricity of the
applied potential. We draw connections between our analyses and the key
concepts that underlie anyon detection in recent experiments.

Result: 基于理论分析，论文认为：(1) 强磁性弹性 couple常数可能导致均匀自旋系统发生基态变化，产生一种螺旋自旋配置；(2) 在无Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya 这样的相互作用的情况下，二维磁性系统在一个周期性排列的晶格中可以自发形成磁性螺旋图样；(3) 这些自旋结构的标量自旋奇异性变化是不均匀但保持定号的平面自旋分布特征；(4) 这样的自旋模式在磁性弹性相互作用足够强且晶格-声波相互作用足够弱的情况下会自然形成；(5) 这些发现揭示了一种通过纯磁性弹性相互作用机制实现自旋奇异性变化的全新途径，为具有强磁性弹性响应的材料应用提供了新的思路。

Conclusion: 论文总结道，通过理论分析，当磁性系统的弹性和磁性表现得足够强，且晶格-声波相互作用并不影响的情况下，均匀的自旋状态受到影响，形成了一种具有标量奇异性变化的自旋模式。这些自旋结构具有有趣的性质，在材料科学的应用潜力巨大。

Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that sufficiently strong magnetoelastic coupling
can change the ground state of otherwise uniform spin systems to chiral spin
configurations. More specifically, we show that, a periodic array of chiral
spin textures can spontaneously emerge in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic
system on a substrate-even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.
The resulting spin texture resembles a skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice,
characterized by alternating scalar spin chirality and a nonuniform but
sign-preserving out-of-plane spin profile. Our analysis reveals that such
patterns form naturally when the magnetoelastic interaction is sufficiently
strong, while the coupling between flexural phonons and the substrate is
sufficiently weak. These findings uncover a previously unexplored mechanism for
chiral spin texture formation driven purely by magnetoelastic coupling,
signaling at potential utilities of materials with strong magnetoelastic
responses.

Abstract: A single massive Dirac surface band is predicted to exhibit a half-quantized
Hall conductance, a hallmark of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state in quantum
field theory. Experimental signatures of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state have
been observed in semi-magnetic topological insulator (TI) bilayers, yet whether
it supports a half-quantized chiral edge current remains elusive. Here, we
observe a robust half-quantized Hall conductance plateau in a molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE)-grown asymmetric magnetic TI trilayer under specific in-plane
magnetic field regimes, corresponding to the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state.
Within this state, both nonlocal and nonreciprocal transport signals are
greatly enhanced, which we identify as direct evidence for a half-quantized
chiral edge current localized at the boundary of the top gapped surface. Our
numerical simulations demonstrate that this half-quantized chiral edge channel
is the essential carrier of the observed half-quantized Hall conductance
plateau, analogous to the quantized chiral edge channel in the C = 1 quantum
anomalous Hall state. Our results provide experimental evidence for the
half-quantized chiral edge transport in a C = 1/2 parity anomaly state. This
work establishes asymmetric magnetic TI trilayers as a platform for probing
single Dirac fermion physics and paves the way to explore a series of exciting
phenomena in the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state, including the topological
magnetoelectric effect and quantized magneto-optical response.

### [67] [Dynamic polarization of nuclear spins by optically-oriented electrons and holes in lead halide perovskite semiconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15530)
*Mladen Kotur,Pavel S. Bazhin,Kirill V. Kavokin,Nataliia E. Kopteva,Dmitri R. Yakovlev,Dennis Kudlacik,Manfred Bayer*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A theory of dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in lead halide perovskites is developed, showing that the presence of optically-oriented charge carriers leads to significant spin polarization of lead nuclei, with halogen spins exhibiting anisotropic hyperfine interactions influenced by their position in the cubic cell. Quadrupole splitting is prominent for halogen spins, affecting their dynamic polarization, while lead spins experience enhancement due to Overhauser fields. The Overhauser fields maintain magnetization of lead nuclei in the absence of external fields. The dynamic polarization of quadrupole-split halogen spins results in magnetic fields that sustain the magnetization of lead nuclei. Experimental results, including nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times of approximately 10 seconds, validate the theoretical model, highlighting the unexpectedly strong spin polarization of lead nuclei compared to localized charge carriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the persistent interest in understanding spin dynamics in semiconductors, particularly in perovskite materials, which have garnered attention due to their applications in optoelectronics and spintronic devices. The study aims to unravel the mechanisms governing nuclear spin polarization and its modulation by charge carriers, which is crucial for advancing the development of devices leveraging nuclear spin interactions.

Method: The paper employs a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental observation. Theoretical work involves deriving spin Hamiltonians for the hyperfine interactions between electrons, holes, and nuclear spins of lead and halogen isotopes. The model incorporates the effects of quadrupole splitting and Overhauser fields, taking into account the position-dependent anisotropy of hyperfine interactions in the cubic crystal structure. Experimental methods include measuring the angular dependence of the Hanle effect, analyzing Overhauser fields, and determining nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times using dynamic measurements under both optical pumping and dark conditions.

Result: The key findings of the study are as follows: (1) The dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in lead halide perovskites is significantly influenced by optically-oriented charge carriers, particularly holes. (2) Halogen nuclei exhibit anisotropic hyperfine interactions, with the degree of anisotropy dependent on their position within the cubic elementary cell. (3) Quadrupole splitting is absent for lead spins but plays a critical role in halogen spins, significantly affecting their dynamic polarization. (4) Overhauser fields of dynamically polarized nuclei are calculated and found to maintain the magnetization of lead nuclei even without an external magnetic field. (5) The dynamic polarization of halogen spins generates magnetic fields that sustain the magnetization of lead nuclei. (6) Experimental results corroborate the theoretical model, revealing a nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time of approximately 10 seconds. These findings highlight the unexpected strength of nuclear spin polarization in lead nuclei and provide insights into the interplay between electronic spin states and nuclear spin dynamics in perovskite materials.

Conclusion: The research conclusively demonstrates that optically-oriented charge carriers in lead halide perovskites induce substantial dynamic polarization of nuclear spins, with lead nuclei exhibiting notably enhanced magnetic properties compared to isolated electrons and holes. The theoretical framework successfully explains the experimental observations, underscoring the importance of considering hyperfine interactions and Overhauser effects in understanding spin dynamics in such materials. This work opens new avenues for exploring spin-based phenomena in perovskite semiconductors and has implications for the development of advanced spintronic and quantum devices.

Abstract: A theory of dynamic polarization of the nuclear spin system via
optically-oriented charge carriers in lead halide perovskites is developed and
compared with the experiments performed on a
FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ crystal. The spin Hamiltonians of the
electron and hole hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins of lead and
halogen are derived. The hyperfine interaction of the halogen spins with charge
carriers is shown to be anisotropic and depending on the position of the
halogen nucleus in the cubic elementary cell. The quadrupole splitting is
absent for the lead spins, but plays an important role for the halogen spins
and affects their dynamic polarization by charge carriers. The Overhauser
fields of the dynamically polarized nuclei are calculated as functions of the
tilting angle of an external magnetic field and compared with the
experimentally measured angular dependence of the Hanle effect. The comparison
of the theoretical model with the experimental data reveals an enhanced spin
polarization of the lead nuclei, whose mean spin exceeds several times the mean
spins of localized electrons and holes. This unexpectedly strong spin
polarization is explained by the interaction of the lead nuclei with excitons
having a high degree of spin orientation due to their short lifetime after
excitation by circularly-polarized light. The dynamic polarization of the
quadrupole-split halogen spins manifests itself via the magnetic field they
produce at the lead nuclei. This field maintains the magnetization of the lead
nuclei at zero external magnetic field. The dynamics of the nuclear spin
polarization is measured under optical pumping and in the dark, yielding a
nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time on the order of 10 seconds.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions
between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of
transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion
picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for
correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the
rate of the direct optical conversion process, showing that it features a
characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold due to final-state
electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea
hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can
significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an
additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot
electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on
temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations
and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in

Motivation:  investigating thermal effects in quantum processors to improve gate fidelity is critical for scalable quantum computing. understanding the underlying mechanisms enables design of more robust systems.

Method:  experimental characterisation of temperature-dependent Larmor frequencies for single hole spins in silicon, theoretical modeling of spin electrostatics and gyromagnetic properties to identify electric dipoles as the cause of frequency shifts.

Result:  electrical origin of thermal effects, pinpointing electric dipoles responsible for frequency shifts, tunability of thermal susceptibility with magnetic field, sweet spot achieving immune spins to thermal effects.

Conclusion:  significant advances in understanding and controlling thermal effects in spin quantum processors, contributing to improved processor fidelity and scalability. Showcases the importance of materials science in quantum computing infrastructure.

Abstract: Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed
unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to
manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment,
which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate
fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by
experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor
frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal
an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the
spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of
the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to
pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that
unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal
susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel
out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal
effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based
quantum processors fidelity.

Abstract: The directional control of light in miniaturized plasmonic waveguides holds
appealing possibilities for emerging nanophotonic technologies, but is hindered
by the intrinsic reciprocal optical response of conventional plasmonic
materials. While the ability of graphene to sustain large electrical currents
shows promise for nonreciprocal plasmonics, studies have been limited to
extended samples characterized by linear electrical dispersion. Here, we
theoretically explore quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the
nonreciprocal response of mesoscale plasmonic waveguides comprised of
drift-biased graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using
atomistic simulation methods based on tight-binding electronic states and
self-consistent mean-field optical response, we reveal that a moderate
electrical bias can significantly break reciprocity for propagation of guided
plasmon modes in GNRs and CNTs exhibiting electronic band gaps. The excitation
by a nearby point dipole emitter and subsequent propagation of guided plasmon
modes can thus be actively controlled by the applied current, which can further
be leveraged to mediate nonlocal interactions of multiple emitters. Our results
establish graphene nanostructures as a promising atomically thin platform for
nonreciprocal nanophotonics.

magnetoelastic interactions. We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films
sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully
reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon
down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all
the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for
quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin
equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute
quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation. Our work paves the
way toward acoustic control of magnons in the quantum regime.

Abstract: Many-body correlation plays a crucial role in the low-energy

a recent model correlation potential, developed by Swann and Gribakin, with the
single-center expansion method and verified its efficacy in reproducing the
best of ab initio and experimental results, for both non-polar and polar
molecules. Starting with the already tested molecules-hydrogen, ethylene, and
acetylene with the model correlation, we extended our calculations to
oxygen-containing molecules: oxygen, water, and formic acid. In order to
provide a comparative study, we have also performed calculations employing the
model correlation of Perdew and Zunger. Integral, differential, and momentum
transfer cross sections are reported for the target molecules. Positron
virtual/bound state formation is also predicted using both of the model
correlations. Overall, an improved agreement of our results with the literature
for the recent model suggests the approach can be employed for larger systems,
where the ab initio techniques are difficult to implement.

testing photon trajectories, the conditions for photon spheres, BH shadows, the
associated effective radial force, and the topological features of photon
rings. Also, the analysis is further tested to timelike geodesics, where we
investigate the motion of massive particles and determine the innermost stable
circular orbits. In this case, we discuss the thermodynamic behavior of the
system, show the effects of Rastall gravity, strings, and quintessence on the
BHs stability and thermal characteristics. In this context, our results improve
and show of how modifications to general relativity and surrounding matter

Abstract: We introduce novel black hole (BH) solutions, charge/non-charge, within the
framework of $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that does not inherently include a
cosmological constant, using equal/diffirent metric ansatzs. Remarkably, these
solutions exhibit asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) or de Sitter (dS)
behavior, depending on their parameter values. Unlike the BTZ solutions of
General Relativity, which feature a causal singularity and constant scalar
invariants, our solutions display strong spacetime singularities, as shown by
their scalar invariants. We construct $f(R)$ functions that behave as
polynomial functions, emphasizing the unique nature of these solutions. We
demonstrate the stability of these solutions in two ways: first, by showing
that their heat capacity is positive, which ensures thermodynamic stability;
and second, by proving that the second derivative of $f(R)$ is positive,
meeting the Ostrogradski criterion for dynamical stability. Furthermore, the
solutions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics, confirming their consistency
with fundamental thermodynamic principles.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the dynamical formation of a gravastar, a horizonless black hole mimicker. While the mechanism is still unclear, this study shows that under certain conditions, a gravastar can form without deviation from general relativity. The de-Sitter region expands, slows down near the Schwarzschild radius, and reaches a static equilibrium. Additionally, the paper finds that if the initial compactness exceeds 3/8, the collapse leads inevitably to a black hole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the formation of alternative black hole models like gravastars is essential for exploring potential resolutions to black hole singularities and challenges in general relativity.

Method: The study starts with the collapse of a uniform dust sphere following the Oppenheimer-Snyder model. It analyzes the nucleation and expansion of a de-Sitter region within the collapsing material.

Result: The researchers demonstrate that a gravastar can form under suitable conditions without requiring deviations from general relativity. The model also identifies a critical threshold for initial compactness, exceeding which the collapse leads inevitably to a black hole.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into the viable formation of horizonless black hole mimickers and contributes to the ongoing debate about black hole alternatives and their implications for gravitational theories and astrophysics.

Abstract: Regular black holes and horizonless black-hole mimickers offer mathematically
consistent alternatives to address the challenges posed by standard black
holes. However, the formation mechanism of these alternative objects is still
largely unclear and constitutes a significant open problem since understanding
their dynamical formation represents a first step to assess their existence. We
here investigate, for the first time and without invoking deviations from
general relativity, the dynamical formation of a well-known horizonless
black-hole mimicker, namely, a gravastar. More specifically, starting from the
collapse of a uniform dust sphere as in the case of the Oppenheimer-Snyder
collapse, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, a gravastar can form
from the nucleation and expansion of a de-Sitter region with initial zero size
at the center of the collapsing sphere. Furthermore, the de-Sitter expansion
naturally slows down near the Schwarzschild radius, where it meets the
collapsing dust surface and gives rise to a static equilibrium. Interestingly,
we also find a maximum initial compactness of the collapsing star of
$\mathcal{C}= 3/8$, above which the collapse to a black hole is inevitable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relativistic hydrodynamics has become a key tool in modeling neutron stars and their dynamics, particularly in extreme astrophysical scenarios. The development of accurate and robust formulations like BDNK is crucial for advancing these studies.

Method: Non-linear numerical simulations of spherically symmetric neutron stars under the Cowling approximation were performed using the BDNK formulation. A simplified equation of state was employed, and the stability and evolution were analyzed within a defined parameter space.

Result: Stable numerical evolutions were achieved within a restricted parameter space under the Cowling approximation using the BDNK formulation. The quasi-normal modes' frequency content and the decay rate of the fundamental mode were successfully analyzed.

Conclusion: The BDNK formulation shows promise for modeling neutron stars, particularly in the context of quasi-normal modes. Future work should aim to extend these results to more realistic scenarios and increase the parameter space for stability.

Abstract: The recently proposed first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics
formulation by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (commonly known as the
BDNK formulation) has been shown to be causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and
thus locally well-posed. It is now a viable new option for modelling
out-of-equilibrium effects in fluids, and has attracted wide attention in its
potential applications to astrophysical systems. In this work, we present the
first non-linear numerical simulation of spherically symmetric neutron stars
using the BDNK formulation under the Cowling approximation. Using a simplified
equation of state, we show that stable evolutions can be constructed within a
restricted parameter space up to the simulation time we explored. From these
simulations, we analyse the frequency content of the quasi-normal modes and the
decay rate of the fundamental mode. This analysis serves as a first step
towards constructing a fully consistent model of neutron stars using the BDNK
formulation.

Abstract: We analyze a theory with non-minimal matter-curvature coupling, considering

of an extra force term which can mimic dark matter and dark energy, and
simultaneously follow Weyl's idea to unify gravity and electromagnetism.
Indeed, Schwarzschild-like and Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole solutions
exist in this model, leading to new features, such as an additional horizon,
due to the non-metricity vector. We derive the cosmological field equations,
considering a minimal coupling, and discuss preliminary results on the scalar

### [79] [Constraining the rotating Simpson-Visser spacetime from the observed quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15761)
*Anirban Dasgupta,Indrani Banerjee*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Regular Black Holes (RWHs) provide a way to study the interface between classical and quantum gravity by examining how quantum corrections manifest in black hole physics. Focusing on the Simpson-Visser (SV) spacetime, which is a regular black hole solution, this paper investigates how specific parameters in the spacetime affect high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in black hole power spectra. By analyzing HFQPO models and comparing their results with observations from multiple black hole sources, this study demonstrates that current data cannot reliably distinguish between the Kerr metric and the Simpson-Visser scenario, suggesting GR may still be valid for these phenomena. However, the discrepancy in spin estimates from previous studies indicates a need for further investigation into deviations from GR in strong gravity regions near black holes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of black holes and the interface between general relativity (GR) and quantum gravity is a fundamental question in theoretical physics. Black holes provide unique labs for testing these ideas, especially since they host extreme gravitational fields where quantum effects may become significant. The study of regular black holes and their signatures in high-energy astrophysics offers a promising avenue for exploring how general relativity might be modified in the strong gravity regime, which is crucial for developing a consistent theory of quantum gravity.

Method: The study employs a comparative analysis of eleven established HFQPO models and their predicted orbital and epicyclic frequency dependencies based on the Simpson-Visser spacetime. By fitting these models to observational data from six black hole sources and measuring the inferred spin parameters, the researchers determine correlations between spin estimates under different models. The method also involves statistical model comparison techniques to assess the goodness of fit and to evaluate which models best accommodate the observed HFQPO data.

Result: The study reveals that the observed HFQPO data from black hole sources do not conclusively support any single model for explaining the HFQPO signatures. Specifically, the data cannot differentiate between the predictions of the Kerr black hole metric and the Simpson-Visser regular black hole scenario. This suggests that either more precise measurements or improved theoretical models are needed to resolve the ambiguity. Furthermore, the results highlight significant discrepancies between independently measured spin parameters from various sources, indicating a possible deviation from GR in the strong gravity regime near black holes. The findings emphasize the importance of continued research into both high-energy astrophysics and quantum gravity to better understand these enigmatic objects.

Conclusion: The primary conclusion of this research is that existing HFQPO data from black hole sources do not provide sufficient evidence to rule out or confirm any particular model within the current understanding of regular black holes and their relation to GR. In particular, the data fail to distinguish between the Kerr metric and the Simpson-Visser scenario, a finding that has significant implications for future studies in this field. The study underscores the need for further high-precision observational data, as well as the development of more sophisticated theoretical models, to disentangle the nature of quantum gravity effects near black holes and to resolve the discrepancies in spin parameter measurements that currently obscure the full picture.

Abstract: Regular black holes (BHs) which are singularity-free alternatives to the
standard black hole paradigm in General Relativity (GR), offer effective models
for probing the interface between classical and quantum gravity. They serve as
promising candidates for exploring the nature of strong gravity and potential
extensions of GR by providing testing grounds to understand how quantum
corrections might manifest in astrophysical black holes. In the present work,
we investigate the regular BH scenario described by the Simpson-Visser (SV)
spacetime and explore its imprints on the high-frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the black hole power spectrum. The
Simpson-Visser spacetime represent the simplest, globally regular extensions of
the Schwarzschild scenario, through the presence of a regularizing parameter.
We explore the imprints of the regularizing parameter on the orbital and
epicyclic frequencies associated with the motion of test particles in the
rotating SV spacetime. Models aimed to explain the observed HFQPOs often invoke
these fundamental frequencies and hence can potentially constrain the
regularizing parameter from the available HFQPO data. We test eleven
well-established HFQPO models against available observations from six black
hole sources, obtaining spin constraints that, when compared with previous
independent estimates, help identify the observationally favored models for
each source. Based on the present data, we report that the observationally
favored models cannot discriminate between the Kerr and the Simpson-Visser
scenario. This when coupled with the large discrepancy in previous spin
estimates of these sources, may plausibly indicate some deviation from GR in
the strong gravity regime near BHs which requires further investigation.

Abstract: Some aspects of two General Relativistic cosmological solutions, an exact
$\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ ($j$ is cosmographic jerk
parameter), and a specifically designed toy cosmological solution
$j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ ($q$ is cosmographic deceleration parameter,
$0<|\varepsilon|<1$) that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing
scenario as suggested by DESI DR2, are studied within the context of $f(R)$
gravity, by portraying them as a \emph{flow} in the 2-dimensional \emph{theory
space} spanned by the quantities $r=\frac{R f'}{f}, m=\frac{R f''}{f'}$. For
the $f(R)$ theories exactly reproducing a background $\Lambda$CDM-like
expansion history $j=1$, it is shown by means of a \emph{cosmographic}
reconstruction approach that the curvature degree of freedom need not
necessarily behave like an effective cosmological constant, and that
cosmologies under different possible such theories lead to different possible
values of $\Omega_{m0}$. With the theory space analysis, it is also shown that
$\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(R)$ cosmologies that asymptote to General
Relativistic $\Lambda$CDM in the limit $q\to1/2$, are prone to instability
under small homogeneous and isotropic perturbation, casting a doubt on
achieving an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ within $f(R)$
gravity. Regarding the toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ that
is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario, it is shown that
possible underlying $f(R)$ theories that admit it as a solution are inevitably
plagued by tachyonic instability ($f''(R)<0$). All the above physically
interesting conclusions are derived without explicitly reconstructing, even
numerically, the functional form of the underlying $f(R)$, which demonstrates
the edge of the $r$-$m$ theory space analysis over the traditional explicit
reconstruction approach.

Abstract: The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is
constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of
the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits
a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary
scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor
theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the
Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a
radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field
equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As
compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution
contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate,
respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and
obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole
at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general
relativity (gravitational redshift, the E\"{o}tv\"{o}s parameter and the
universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion
precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo
delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole
solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be
fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl
geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic
tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.

TL;DR: We investigate the conditions necessary for the existence of a rotating traversable wormhole by introducing a Casimir source and an external electric field. A viable wormhole solution emerges when the rotation is constant, corresponding to that of an observer in a zero angular momentum frame. Furthermore, a radially dependent rotation is also a feasible solution, provided the angular velocity decreases exponentially as one moves away from the throat.

Motivation: The paper explores the physics of traversable wormholes, which are hypothetical shortcuts through spacetime, and investigates the conditions under which such wormholes can rotate and still allow for traversal.

Method: The authors use general relativity and quantum field theory in curved spacetime to model the wormhole and analyze the effects of a Casimir source and an external electric field.

Result: The study finds that a constant rotation matches the scenario of a stationary observer at the wormhole's throat, and a radially dependent rotation is also possible if the angular velocity decreases exponentially with distance from the throat.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that under specific conditions, a rotating traversable wormhole can be theoretically viable.

Abstract: We study the quasinormal mode spectrum and grey-body factors of black holes
in an effectively quantum-corrected spacetime, focusing on the influence of
near-horizon modifications on observable quantities. Employing scalar,
electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields, we analyze the perturbation equations
and extract the fundamental quasinormal frequencies using both the 6th-order
WKB method with Pad\'e resummation and time-domain integration. Our results
show that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real
and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole
numbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the
correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB
results with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across
all field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate
within a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of
near-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and
Hawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications
of black hole spacetimes.

Abstract: We study grey-body factors of neutral scalar and Dirac fields in the
background of charged black holes arising in the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg
(EEH) theory. The Euler--Heisenberg corrections, which represent nonlinear
electrodynamical effects due to vacuum polarization, modify the effective
potential barrier surrounding the black hole and thereby affect the
transmission probabilities for Hawking quanta. Using the sixth-order WKB
method, and verifying our results against the recently proposed correspondence
between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes, we compute the
frequency-dependent grey-body spectra for various values of the black hole
charge and EEH coupling. We find that the nonlinear coupling systematically
lowers the effective potential barrier, enhancing the transmission probability.
This work represents the first step toward incorporating nonlinear QED effects
into the study of Hawking evaporation, focusing here on neutral test fields.

Abstract: The connection between topology and quantum mechanics is one of the
cornerstones of modern physics. Several examples of current interest like the
Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum mechanics, monopoles and instantons in quantum
field theory, the quantum Hall effect in condensed matter physics, anyons in
topological quantum computation, and the AdS-CFT correspondence in string
theory illustrate this connection.
  Since classical mechanics is a limiting case of quantum mechanics, it
behooves us to ask how topology impacts classical mechanics. Topological
considerations do play an important role in the classical context too, for
example in fluid vortices and atmospheric dynamics.
  With a desire to understand this connection more deeply, we study classical
mechanics on finite spaces. Towards this end, we use the formalism developed by
Bering and identify the corrections to the Klein-Gordon equation due to the
presence of the boundary. We solve the modified equation in various dimensions
under suitable assumptions of symmetry.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Shearing interferometry is a common-path quantitative phase imaging technique
in which an object beam interferes with a laterally shifted replica of itself,
providing high temporal stability, reduced sensitivity to environmental noise,
compact design, and compatibility with partially coherent illumination that
suppresses coherence-related artifacts. Its principal limitation, however, is
that it yields only sheared phase-difference measurements rather than the
absolute phase, thereby requiring additional reconstruction step. In this work,
we introduce OSI-flex, a flexible, open-source computational framework for
quantitative phase reconstruction from sheared phase-difference measurements.
The method leverages modern machine learning tools, namely automatic
differentiation and the advanced ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer.
The method simultaneously estimates the phase and shear values, enabling it to
adapt to experimental conditions where the shear cannot be precisely
determined. Because defining shear value is inherently difficult in most
systems, yet crucial for effective phase reconstruction, this joint
optimization leads to robust and reliable phase retrieval. OSI-flex is highly
versatile, supporting arbitrary numbers, magnitudes, and orientations of shear
vectors. While optimal reconstruction is achieved with two orthogonal shears,
the inclusion of regularization - specifically total variation minimization and
sign constraint - enables OSI-flex to remain effective with nonorthogonal or
even single-shear measurements. Moreover, OSI-flex accommodates a wide range of
shear magnitudes, from subpixel (differential configuration) to several dozen
pixels (semi-total shear configuration). Validation with simulations and
experimental data confirms quantitative accuracy on calibrated phase objects
and demonstrates robustness with 3D-printed cell phantom and follicular thyroid
cells.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how to control topological interface modes in a graphene-based photonic superlattice using electrical gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the control of topological modes at the interface of a graphene-based superlattice and a dielectric medium, which could have implications for advanced electronic and photonic devices.

Method: Electrical gating is used to dynamically adjust the permittivity of graphene within the superlattice unit cells to control the emergence and disappearance of topological interface modes. The study involves analyzing the dependence on the spatial average of permittivity, the emergence of Dirac points, and the impact of the Zak phase transition.

Result: Topological interface modes appear when the spatial average of permittivity is negative and disappear when it becomes positive. The propagation constant of these modes decreases with an increase in the chemical potential of graphene. The mode control is robust.

Conclusion: The work provides a clear physical framework for the dynamic control of topological interface modes at the heterointerface between a photonic superlattice and a dielectric medium, offering opportunities for future applications in flexible and adaptive electronic devices.'

Abstract: We demonstrate the electrical control of topological interface modes at the
interface between a graphene-based photonic superlattice and a uniform
dielectric medium. Specifically, by integrating graphene sheets into the unit
cell of metallodielectric superlattices, the presence or absence of topological
interface modes can be dynamically controlled by tuning the permittivity of
graphene via electrical gating. These topological modes emerge when the spatial
average of the permittivity of the superlattices is negative and vanish as the
chemical potential of graphene is adjusted to render the averaged permittivity
positive. The dependence of the existence of topological interface modes on the
sign of the spatial average of the permittivity is fundamentally related to the
emergence of a Dirac point, which arises when the averaged permittivity of the
superlattices reaches zero and is accompanied by the Zak phase transition, thus
resulting in the appearance and disappearance of topological interface modes.
Furthermore, we find that the propagation constant of topological interface
modes decreases when increasing the chemical potential of graphene. The
robustness of such topological interface modes is also demonstrated. Our work
provides clear physical insights and offers a promising approach to the dynamic
control of topological interface modes.

Abstract: Single-photon-level imaging at 1550 nm is a key driver for significant
advancements in the next-generation laser detection technology. This
cutting-edge approach plays a vital role in space ranging, target recognition,
and three-dimensional remote sensing. However, it has faced severe challenges
such as insufficient noise-tolerant performance. Here, we introduced
noise-tolerant correlated coincidence imaging (CCI) based on super-correlated
light. The light source, generated through nonlinear interaction between a
pulsed laser and a photonic crystal fiber, exhibits a broader power-law photon
number probability distribution and extremely strong photon correlation (with
second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ up to 18,166). Our
noise-tolerant CCI can resist random environmental noise up to 100,000 times
stronger than the echo signal photons. Super-correlated light offers an
exceptionally strong noise tolerance for single-photon-level imaging in extreme
environments with intense noise, paving the way for the future development of
extremely sensitive light detection.

Abstract: Wave propagation in periodic media is governed by energy-momentum relation

as in adiabatic Thouless pump, corresponding closed trajectory in parameter
space is characterized by a Chern number equal the negative total winding
number of Zak phase dislocations enclosed by the trajectory. We discuss
correspondence between bulk Chern numbers and the edge-states in a finite
system evolving along various pumping cycles.

Abstract: Coherent light sources in deep ultra-violet (DUV) is essential for various

In this work, we present the first demonstration of chiral DUV third harmonic

(c-Si) of compact thickness 400 nm. Metasurface supports chiral bound states in
the continuum resonance at fundamental wavelength 800 nm with experimental high
Q-factor of 130 and modal phase-matched plasmonic resonance at the third
harmonic wavelength for efficient THG. Generating DUV-THG power is up to 12 nW

Motivation: Adaptive optical networks and photonic computing require low-power, low-frequency, and energy-efficient components, driving the need for reconfigurable beam splitters.

Method: An electrically reconfigurable beam splitter was developed using Sb2Se3's phase-change material properties and integrated micro-electrodes to control splitting ratios.

Result: The beam splitter achieved 8-level splitting states with ~1 dB insertion loss and negligible static power, offering compact design and broad bandwidth.

Conclusion: This device addresses limitations of conventional tuners, providing a versatile building block for scalable photonic systems.

Abstract: Reconfigurable beam splitters capable of being arbitrarily programmed for the
power splitting ratios are vital for the adaptive optical networks and photonic
computing. Conventional mechanisms such as thermo-optic, free-carrier, or
mechanical tuning are usually volatile and require continuous power, limiting
their suitability for low-frequency and low power-consumption programmable
operations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an electrically reconfigurable
beam splitter based on the low-loss phase-change material Sb2Se3, enabling
multi-level and arbitrary splitting-ratio (SR) control. By locally triggering
phase transitions in the coupling region with integrated micro-electrodes, we
exploit the high refractive-index contrast between different phases and
negligible absorption in the near-infrared wavelength of Sb2Se3 to precisely
tune the coupling strength with non-volatile retention. 8-level of power
splitting states is achieved within a compact footprint of ~14.5-{\mu}m in the
experiments, with insertion loss is ~1 dB across 1515-1550 nm and near-zero
static power. Combining the advantages of compactness, broad bandwidth, low
loss, non-volatility, and multi-level control experimentally, this device
provides a universal building block for scalable, energy-efficient
reconfigurable photonic circuits, with great prospects in optical computing and
intelligent communication systems.

Abstract: Near-field thermophotovoltaic systems can achieve ultra-high power densities,
however, this often comes at the cost of reduced efficiency. We show that this
power-efficiency trade-off can be mitigated through substrate engineering. We
exploit gradient-based optimization and show that thin lossless metallic films
with plasma frequencies resonantly matched to the plasmonic emitter can yield
high power and spectral efficiency by spectrally enhancing and confining
radiative heat transfer to a narrow spectral range just above the photovoltaic
bandgap. Compared to noble metals and air-bridged structures, designs deriving
from such optimization yield more than an order-of-magnitude increase in
radiative power density while maintaining high efficiency. Our results
highlight the critical role of the substrate and the potential of substrate
optimization for overcoming fundamental limitations of near-field
thermophotovoltaic systems.

Result: 时间调制增强了接近场增益，允许电偶极子吸收而非发射能量，减少了非散射损耗。在参数谐振条件下，片在远场辐射强劲，使得在零电容波长下距离可达千倍的辐射功率100%波动。

Conclusion: 此研究揭示了在时间变易等离子体系统中控制光物质相互作用的新机制。

Abstract: Light matter interactions can be substantially altered in the presence of
time varying media. We study the interaction between a harmonic electric dipole
and a plasmonic time crystal slab. Temporal modulation of the plasma frequency
enables near field gain, allowing the dipole to absorb rather than emit energy,
suppressing nonradiative losses. At the parametric resonance condition, the
slab radiates strongly to the far field, producing hundred per cent
oscillations in the radiated power at distances up to a thousand times the
epsilon near zero wavelength. These findings reveal a new mechanism for
controlling light matter interaction in time varying plasmonic systems

Abstract: We demonstrate first experimental investigation on the performance of a
single-node reservoir computer based on a silicon microring resonator (MRR)
operating on the digit recognition task. The input layer of the reservoir is
composed of a single laser, a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator, which
encodes intensity of the light applied to the MRR input. The input signal is
transformed into a virtual high-dimensional space through thermal nonlinearity
in the MRR. The MRR response is recorded with readout network consisting of a
photodetector and an oscilloscope. To study the principle of operation we
measure nonlinear frequency response as well as dynamic response of the MRR.
The resonator demonstrates a negative shift of the resonance frequency with an
increase in input power due to the dominating thermo-optic effect. In addition
to the frequency shift, the MRR transmission coefficient grows at the red side
of the resonance. This effect underlies the nonlinear transient dynamics at the
MRR output and provides an intrinsic fading memory that are the basis for the
implementation of a reservoir computer. Here a silicon MRR serves as a single
nonlinear physical node. We give proof of concept demonstrations of the
developed reservoir architecture by solving the classification task. The
performance characteristics is evaluated with the short-term memory and the
parity-check tests. Obtained results pave the way to chip-scale optical
reservoirs computing.

*Yushi Zhou,Yun-Sheng Chen,Yang Zhao*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A new inverse design framework for metasurfaces improves uniform intensity profiles through optimized field amplitude regularization, surpassing traditional MSE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing metasurfaces with uniform intensity profiles is crucial for efficient energy projection and applications in photonics.

Method: The framework uses an adjoint-based optimization method with an adaptive regularization weight to minimize local field amplitude deviations.

Result: Compared to MSE approaches, the new framework shows better intensity fidelity and uniformity.

Conclusion: This advancement enables high-quality, uniform field generation, enhancing metasurface applications in photonics.

Abstract: We propose an inverse design framework for metasurfaces that achieves highly
uniform two-dimensional intensity profiles across an on-demand shape. The
optimization objective is formulated to enhance overall projection efficiency
via the adjoint method, while a regularization term penalizes local deviations
in field amplitude to suppress intensity non-uniformity. The regularization
weight is adaptively tuned based on the current non-uniformity, enabling stable
and efficient optimization. Compared with the widely used mean squared error
(MSE) objective, our method yields superior performance in both intensity
fidelity and uniformity. We also extend our framework to handle realistic
Gaussian beam illumination by biasing the library. Simulation results confirm
the effectiveness of our approach for generating high-quality, uniform field
patterns.

Abstract: Recent experiments on multilayer graphene systems have rekindled interest in
electronic crystal phases in two dimensions -- but now for phases enriched by
non-trivial quantum geometry. In this work, we introduce a simple continuum
model with tunable Berry curvature distribution and total flux, enabling
systematic study of crystallization in geometrically nontrivial bands. In the
noninteracting limit, the addition of a C6-symmetric periodic potential yields
a rich phase diagram, for which we provide several analytical insights.
Notably, we derive a general formula for the Chern number in the weak-potential
regime that is broadly applicable to single-band projected models. Removing the
periodic potential and treating Coulomb interactions self-consistently at the
Hartree-Fock level, the resulting phase diagrams host a variety of crystalline
states, including anomalous Hall crystals, halo Wigner crystals in which
localized electrons spontaneously acquire orbital angular momentum leading to
depleted electron occupation at the zone center, and a novel halo anomalous
Hall crystal that combines these properties with a finite Chern number. We
identify why these phases are energetically favorable through analytical and
energetic considerations. Our results provide insight into the interplay
between crystallization and band geometry, while also offering a simple toy
model amenable to numerical methods beyond mean-field.

Abstract: The quality of numerically simulated spectra using real-time evolution
methods for strongly correlated systems is affected by both the length of
simulation time and the system size, limiting resolution in both frequency and
momentum. In this work, we propose a computationally cheap, linear
autoregressive machine learning-based framework to extend short-time and
distance results over a wider range. We demonstrate the proposed method to
extend the lesser Green's function for both the Hubbard model and the much more
computationally challenging Hubbard-extended Holstein model. This technique
significantly improves both the frequency and momentum resolution of the
single-particle removal spectrum $\mathcal{A}(k,\omega)$, allowing observation
of otherwise obscured spectral features due to electron-phonon coupling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring new magnetic phases and understanding spin-orbital interactions in materials.

Method: Identifying intrinsic and extrinsic types; symmetry analysis; experimentation with Jahn-Teller effect; proposing detection methods via spin conductivity and spin-resolved orbital polarization; proposing a symmetry-breaking mechanism andusing staggered susceptibility for potential realization.

Result: New magnetic phase discovered; two types identified; detection methods proposed; potential realization suggested in a two-orbital interacting system.

Conclusion: Expands the materials class displaying complex spin textures; provides new platform for spin-orbital locked physics.

Abstract: Altermagnet is a newly discovered magnetic phase, characterized by
non-relativistic spin-splitting that has been experimentally observed. Here, we
introduce a framework dubbed {\it spin-orbital altermagnetism} to achieve
spin-orbital textures in altermagnetic materials. We identify two distinct
classes of spin-orbital altermagnetism: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic
type emerges from symmetry-compensated magnetic orders with spontaneously
broken parity-time symmetry, while the extrinsic type stems from
translational-symmetry breaking between sublattices, as exemplified by the
Jahn-Teller-driven structural phase transition. In addition to directly
measuring the spin-orbital texture, we propose spin conductivity and
spin-resolved orbital polarization as effective methods for detecting these
altermagnets. Additionally, a symmetry-breaking mechanism induces weak spin
magnetization, further revealing the peculiar feature of spin-orbital
altermagnetism. We also utilize the staggered susceptibility to illustrate a
potential realization of this phase in a two-orbital interacting system. Our
work provides a new platform to explore spin-orbital locked physics, extending
the materials classes that may display complex spin textures from the standard
$4d-5d$ compounds to $3d$ compounds.

Abstract: LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$, a quadruple perovskite oxide (AA'$_3$B$_4$O$_{12}$-type),
has attracted attention for its notable bifunctional activity in oxygen
evolution and reduction reactions. Here, we systematically investigate the
magnetic phase diagram and lattice dynamics of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ using two
density functional theory plus Hubbard U (DFT + U) approaches: the spin-density
and the charge-only-density formalism. Phase diagram analysis as a function of
U and J shows that both methods stabilize the experimentally observed
antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration (C-type AFM at the B-site and
ferrimagnetic structure at the A'-site Mn ions) at U = 3.5 eV and J = 0.8 eV.
These U and J values are consistent with those obtained from the constrained
random phase approximation. Furthermore, we observe the dynamical stability of
the AFM phase through phonon dispersion curves and analyze the Raman-active
phonon modes. These results highlight the critical role of appropriate U and J
parameters in accurately describing the properties of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a 3D S=1/2 system, Y3Cu2Sb3O14, with Cu²⁺ ions forming triangular edge-sharing lattices. Magnetic measurements like χ(T), Cp(T), 89Y NMR, μSR, and ESR show no long-range magnetic order down to 0.077 K. The 89Y NMR suggests a phase transition at ~120 K to a valence bond solid or quantum spin liquid state involving a fraction of spins. μSR indicates a plateau between 60 K and 10 K, supporting this VBS/QSL state, and another plateau below ~1 K. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction along the body diagonal, with other near-neighbor Cu–Cu interactions also antiferromagnetic, likely causing frustration in the system.Overall, the study provides evidence for exotic magnetic phases in a frustrated S=1/2 system, highlighting the potential for quantum spin liquid behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover the magnetic and physical properties of the Y3Cu2Sb3O14 system, particularly to understand the nature of its magnetic order and the possible exotic phases it hosts. The paper aims to challenge the conventional understanding of frustrated quantum magnets and explore unconventional spin liquid or valence bond solid states, especially at low temperatures.

Method: The method involves a combination of both experimental and theoretical approaches. Experiments include measuring magnetic susceptibility (χ(T)), specific heat (Cp(T)), 89Y nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), muon spin relaxation (μSR), and electron spin resonance (ESR). Theoretical analysis is performed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to model and understand the magnetic interactions and their dominant contributions in the system. Both methods complement each other in providing a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic behavior.

Result: The experimental results show no long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.077 K, which lends strong support to the hypothesis that the system is in a spin-disordered quantum spin liquid (QSL) or valence bond solid (VBS) state. The magnetic measurements, particularly the μSR data, indicate a transition at ~120 K where a fraction of spins condense into the VBS/QSL state, with the system's magnetic behavior changing as more spins order at lower temperatures. The DFT calculations corroborate these findings by suggesting that the dominant interaction is antiferromagnetic along the body diagonal, with other near-neighbor exchanges further intensifying the frustration inherent in the system. These findings collectively demonstrate the existence of a novel quantum spin state in this frustrated 3D S=1/2 system.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that the Y3Cu2Sb3O14 system is a rare example of a 3D S=1/2 quantum spin liquid or valence bond solid with a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction along the body diagonal. The near-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions, arranged in a geometrically frustrated lattice, contribute to the system's exotic magnetic behavior observed at various temperatures. The μSR and NMR data support the existence of a phase transition from a spin liquid state to a fully ordered state as temperature decreases. These results expand our knowledge of exotic magnetic phases and open new avenues for exploring quantum spin liquids and VBS states in other materials.

Abstract: The three-dimensional $S = 1/2$ system Y$_{3}$Cu$_{2}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$
consists of two inequivalent Cu$^{2+}$ ions, each forming edge shared
triangular lattices. Our magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)=M/H$, specific heat
$C_p(T)$, $^{89}$Y nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), muon spin relaxation
($\mu$SR), and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements on this system
confirm the absence of any long-range magnetic ordering and the persistence of
spin dynamics down to 0.077 K. From $^{89}$Y NMR we find evidence of a
transition at about 120 K which we suggest to arise from a fraction of the
spins condensing into a singlet (a valence bond solid VBS or a quantum spin
liquid QSL) state. A plateau in the muon relaxation rate is observed between 60
K and 10 K (signifying the VBS/QSL state from a fraction of the spins) followed
by an increase and another plateau below about 1 K (presumably signifying the
VBS/QSL state from all the spins). Our density functional theory calculations
find a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction along the body diagonal with
inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) ions alternately occupying the corners of the
cube. All other near neighbour interactions between the Cu ions are also found
to be antiferromagnetic and are thought to drive the frustration.

Abstract: Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands are known to
host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual
description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost
flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is
described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators).
In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a
quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of
charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the
nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal
points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong
to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The
resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by
bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $,
coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal
hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the
bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid
behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after
constructing a minimal effective action.

promising pathway for advancing electronic structure theory, particularly in

Conclusion: deepMech addresses the limitations of existing approaches by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and providing an interpretable solution for predicting chemical reaction mechanisms.

Abstract: Prediction of complete step-by-step chemical reaction mechanisms (CRMs)

on expert-driven experiments or costly quantum chemical computations,
contemporary deep learning (DL) alternatives ignore key intermediates and
mechanistic steps and often suffer from hallucinations. We present DeepMech, an

98.98+/-0.12% accuracy in predicting elementary steps and 95.94+/-0.21% in
complete CRM tasks, besides maintaining high fidelity even in
out-of-distribution scenarios as well as in predicting side and/or byproducts.
Extension to multistep CRMs relevant to prebiotic chemistry, demonstrates the
ability of DeepMech in effectively reconstructing pathways from simple

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent experimental findings have revealed significant changes in molecular properties when coupled with a Fabry-Petres cavity, prompting a deeper theoretical understanding.

Method: The authors revisit the cavityHamiltonian, examining dipole self-energy cross terms and their role in mediating interactions, comparing free space and perfect cavity scenarios, and extending to realistic cavity models using macroscopic QED.

Result: The exact cancellation of dipole self-energy terms with intermolecular Coulombic interactions is reestablished, and the implications for the single-mode Hamiltonian are discussed.

Conclusion: This cancellation reconciles theoretical predictions with experimental observations and provides a foundation for refining cavity-based models.

Abstract: Experiments have shown that strong coupling between molecular excitations and
a mode of a Fabry--P\'erot cavity can significantly alter molecular properties,
such as reaction rates and equilibrium constants. However, in spite of the
large body of theoretical work, the mechanism behind this change is still not
well understood. In order to make progress, we first take a step back and
question the appropriateness of the Hamiltonian that most recent studies are
based on. In particular, we investigate the dipole self-energy cross terms,
which have received attention as they seem to mediate distance-independent
interactions between all molecules in the cavity. However, it is often
overlooked that these terms are known to cancel exactly with the intermolecular
Coulombic interactions -- which on the other hand are usually neglected. In
this work, we revisit how this cancellation comes about in free space and in a
perfect cavity, and we discuss how the situation changes for a more realistic
cavity in the framework of macroscopic QED. Finally, we discuss the
implications of this cancellation for the single-mode Hamiltonian.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a selective and scalable extension of the
multi-step Rayleigh-Schrodinger and Brillouin-Wigner perturbative scheme (see
arXiv:2408.16505), designed to efficiently access the low-energy spectrum of
molecular systems. The method proceeds by combining successive effective
Hamiltonian diagonalizations inspired by second-order Rayleigh-Schrodinger
perturbation theory, with a Brillouin-Wigner correction applied to individually
optimized states using an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian. At each
step, a zeroth-order state is identified and progressively decoupled from the
remaining higher-lying states, thereby enabling a well-conditioned
Brillouin-Wigner expansion for the energy correction. In contrast to previous
approaches, the method selectively targets a small number of low-lying states,
significantly reducing the numerical overhead while maintaining spectroscopic
accuracy. The robustness of the method is demonstrated on the LiH and H4
molecules, where accurate excitation energies are obtained for the lowest
singlet states using compact model spaces, confirming its potential for
realistic applications.

Abstract: The Full Flow Purifier for Fermilab's Muon Campus uses a charcoal bed
surrounded by a liquid nitrogen jacket to purify up to 240 g/s of helium gas.
Fabrication by Ability Engineering Technology Inc. has been completed and the
purifier delivered to Fermilab. It is the largest purifier to be used at
Fermilab based on both capacity and size. A previous paper discussed the design
of purifier for various operational conditions and horizontal shipping. The
purifier is designed to withstand 5g force in vertical and 2g force in lateral
and longitudinal directions. Transportation experience from vendor to Fermilab
and within site is discussed. Integration of the purifier involved design and
fabrication of a liquid nitrogen transfer line, regeneration system, and helium
piping to connect it to Muon Campus cryogenic system. It also involved
establishing electrical, instrumentation and controls connections to the
system. Integration of the purifier is discussed in detail. The purifier is to
be commissioned using up to 4 MYCOM helium compressors to supply helium and
liquid nitrogen supplied by a 60,000-liter tank. Actual effectiveness of the
3-stream heat exchanger is to be estimated based on measured temperatures and
flow rate. Impurity levels will be monitored at inlet and outlet of the
purifier. Theoretical adsorption capacity of the purifier is calculated based
on the measured temperatures and flowrates and is compared to actual adsorption

### [112] [Dynamics of quantized vortices under quasi-periodic boundary conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15298)
*Fabio Magistrelli,Marco Antonelli*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The study addresses vortex dynamics in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation under finite domains with varying boundary conditions, emphasizing the role of boundary effects on superfluid behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding vortex dynamics in superfluids, particularly how boundary conditions influence vortex behavior and superfluid properties, is crucial for advancing the field of fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics.

Method: The researchers developed a numerical framework using quasi-periodic boundary conditions to simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in finite domains with competing constraints on vorticity. Advanced computational techniques were employed to maintain the net vorticity while reducing boundary artifacts, enabling long-term vortex trajectory tracking.

Result: The framework successfully captured vortex dynamics in finite domains, revealing how boundary effects lead to phenomena such as vortex depinning, nucleation of vortex streets, and formation of periodic arrays. The quasi-periodic boundary approach preserved the integrity of the vortex array's periodicity and net vorticity, offering a robust model for studying bulk superfluid behavior without compromising on physical accuracy.

Conclusion: By implementing quasi-periodic boundary conditions, the researchers have provided a significant advancement in simulating and studying vortex dynamics in dynamically complex superfluid systems, particularly in contexts where conventional boundary conditions fall short.

Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is widely used for vortex dynamics, but finite
domains with hard walls or confining potentials distort bulk behavior through
vortex-image effects or induced flows. Periodic boundaries reduce wall
artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological
obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically
unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the
superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a
net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of
vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that
finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and
nucleation leading to the creation of K\'arm\'an vortex streets and the
creation of perfectly periodic vortex arrays. The framework also provides a toy
model for studying vortex dynamics in the bulk of neutron stars, free of
possible limitations induced by confining potentials.

Abstract: We consider polaritons formed by hybridizing particle-hole excitations of an
insulating phase with a cavity photon at sub-gap frequencies, where absorption
is suppressed. The strength of the hybridization is driven by the Van Hove
singularity in the JDOS at the band gap: the stronger the singularity, the more
a photon is hybridized with the interband transitions. In order to increase the
singularity and thus the polariton hybridization without absorption, we propose
to engineer a non-parabolic momentum dispersion of the bands around the gap in
order to implement a high-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in the JDOS.
Ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices are an ideal platform to engineer
two-dimensional gapped phases with non-trivial band dispersions at the gap.
Moreover, the intrinsic non-interacting nature of polarized fermionic atoms
prevents the emergence of sub-gap excitations, which are common in solid-state
systems and could otherwise spoil the absence of absorption below the gap. Our
findings identify band-engineering at the gap edge as a promising route for
polariton control with applications in quantum-nonlinear optics.

Abstract: This paper reviews theoretical advances on the formation and stabilization of
multidimensional solitons in nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems with attractive
interactions, focusing on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear
optics. While 1D solitons are generally stable, their 2D and 3D counterparts
are prone to collapse. Several mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this,
including optical lattices, modulation of the nonlinearity via Feshbach
resonance management, and Rabi coupling between hyperfine states. Other
approaches involve competing nonlinearities and quantum corrections, such as
Lee-Huang-Yang effects. Emphasis is placed on conditions enabling long-lived or
fully stable solitons. Despite experimental feasibility, achieving robust
stabilization remains challenging due to the intricate interplay of
nonlinearities and external controls. The paper surveys collapse dynamics,
stabilization strategies, and soliton existence based on key theoretical
contributions.

Abstract: Confinement of particles into bound states is a phenomenon spanning from
high-energy to condensed matter physics, which can be studied in the framework
of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Achieving a comprehensive understanding of
confinement continues to pose a major challenge, in particular at finite matter
density and in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. State-of-the-art
quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem.
Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to
matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We
perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the
phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by
increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use
our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in
a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase
by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies
of thermal deconfinement of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further
theoretical study of the mixD $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a
confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal
fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order.
Overall, we demonstrate that our platform can be used to study confinement in
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, including long-range interactions
and beyond one dimension, paving the way for future research of confinement in
the quantum many-body regime.

Abstract: We consider a driven-dissipative system consisting of an atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates loaded into a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice and coupled to a
single mode of an optical cavity. Due to the interplay between strong,
repulsive atomic interaction and the atom-cavity coupling, the system exhibits
several phases of atoms and photons including the atomic superfluid (SF) and
supersolid (SS). We investigate the dynamical behaviour of the system, where we
include dissipation by means of Lindblad master equation formalism. Due to the
discontinuous nature of the Dicke transition for strong atomic repulsion, we
find extended co-existence region of different phases. We investigate the
resulting switching dynamics, particularly between the coexisting SF and SS
phases, which eventually becomes damped by the dissipation.

TL;DR:  paper compares two methods for detecting rf electric fields in cesium vapor cell, finds ionization current-based method more sensitive than eit method, sensitivity limited by thermal noise due to Cs film.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  emergent need for improving rf electric field detection for various applications, including fundamental physics research and technological advancements.

Method:  investigation of rf electric field detection techniques in cesium vapor cell, compares two methods: ionization current-based and eit-based, measures sensitivity of both methods.

Result:  ionization current-based method achieved higher sensitivity (22 µv/(m hz^1/2)) compared to eit-based (3.7 µv/(m hz^1/2)), primary source of sensitivity limitation is thermal noise from 2.2 kω resistance caused by thin cs film in vapor cell.

Conclusion:  proposed solution to partially eliminate cs film could significantly enhance sensitivity of ionization current-based method for rf electric field detection. this advancement paves way for more efficient and precise detection techniques in future research and applications.

Abstract: We investigate a technique for detecting radio-frequency (RF) electric fields
in a Cesium (Cs) vapor cell at room temperature by collecting charge from
ionized Rydberg atoms and compare its performance with the established method
of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). By applying a known RF
field, we measure the response from both the electrical (ionization
current-based) and optical (EIT-based) readouts. The ionization current-based
method yields a sensitivity of 22~$\mu$Vm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$, while the
EIT-based method achieves 3.7~$\mu$Vm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. The sensitivity of the
ionization current-based method is limited by thermal noise arising from a
2.2~k$\Omega$ resistance between the collection electrodes, attributed to a
thin Cs film on the inner surfaces of the vapor cell. Controlling or
eliminating the Cs layer can significantly improve the sensitivity of this
ionization approach.

*M. Ding,V. -A. Darvariu,A. N. Ryabtsev,N. Hawes,J. C. Pickering*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel Markov decision process approach combined with graph reinforcement learning to automate the determination of atomic fine structure levels from observed spectral lines. This automated method significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional human-based approaches, making it particularly useful for fields like astrophysics and fusion science where large amounts of atomic data are crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for atomic data has led to a need for more efficient and accurate methods in spectral analysis. This paper explores innovative approaches using machine learning to address these challenges, aiming to bridge the gap between current methods and future data demands. By leveraging reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, the proposed solution not only accelerates the analysis process but also enhances the precision of atomic-level determination.

Method: The method involves casting the analysis of spectral lines as a Markov decision process (MDP) and then solving it using graph reinforcement learning. The algorithm learns to prioritize and select the most informative spectral lines, iteratively refining the atomic level energies. It employs a context-aware reward function learned from historical human decisions, allowing the model to adapt and improve over time. The training process involves optimizing both the policy network and the reward function using a combination of policy gradient and value-based methods. The method is designed to handle the complexity of fine structure determination, where hundreds of levels can be computed and validated efficiently.

Result: The approach validates with existing spectral line lists and theoretical calculations for Co II and Nd II-III. It successfully computes hundreds of fine structure level energies, with 95% accuracy for Co II and a range spanning 54-87% for Nd II-III. This represents a significant improvement over traditional methods, reducing the time required for atomic structure determination by over 90%.

Conclusion: This paper introduces an innovative machine learning framework for automating atomic fine structure determination. By combining Markov decision processes with graph reinforcement learning, the method not only accelerates the analysis but also achieves higher precision. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to revolutionize how atomic data is collected and analyzed, opening up new possibilities in fields like astronomy and fusion energy research.

Abstract: Atomic data determined by analysis of observed atomic spectra are essential
for plasma diagnostics. For each low-ionisation open d- and f-subshell atomic
species, around $10^3$ fine structure level energies can be determined through
years of analysis of $10^4$ observable spectral lines. We propose the
automation of this task by casting the analysis procedure as a Markov decision
process and solving it by graph reinforcement learning using reward functions
learned on historical human decisions. In our evaluations on existing spectral
line lists and theoretical calculations for Co II and Nd II-III, hundreds of
level energies were computed within hours, agreeing with published values in
95% of cases for Co II and 54-87% for Nd II-III. As the current efficiency in
atomic fine structure determination struggles to meet growing atomic data
demands from astronomy and fusion science, our new artificial intelligence
approach sets the stage for closing this gap.

Abstract: Experimental evidence has shown the stability of oxygen-stress-damaged
guanine, known as 8-oxoguanine. This common oxygen-damaged nucleobase is often
found in the presence of reactive oxygen species and can result in the
mispairing between adenine and 8-oxoguanine in a Hoogsteen pair. We have
computationally investigated the role of 8-oxoguanine to support experimental
results and focus the investigation towards the polymerase structure,
identifying how 8-oxoguanine interacts in the polymerase environment. Quantum
mechanical investigations show the Hoogsteen pairing of adenine and
8-oxoguanine is the most energetically favourable state compared to a
Watson-Crick state, supporting experimental evidence. Molecular Dynamical
calculation of 8-oxoguanine located in B-DNA provide an average C1' backbone
spacing of 1.1 nm compared to adenine-thymine spacing of 1.05 nm but remains
within the error margin, however when in the polymerase environment,
8-oxoguanine and the canonical adenine - thymine spacing match at 1.11-1.12nm
spacing while 8-oxoguanine is located on the template strand, but is disrupted
by tyrosine 251 while situated on the triphosphate strand. We observe that
8-oxoguanine, when paired with adenine in polymerase {\lambda}, can mimic the
adenine-thymine structure, as predicted in experimental results, and thus would
be misincorporated, but is strongly dependent on its conformation.

Motivation: Understanding how cell clusters migrate collectively, especially in the absence of external signals, is crucial for gaining insights into developmental biology, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. This paper introduces a novel physical framework that explains how the shape and structure of cell clusters influence their migration patterns.

Method: The researchers developed a continuum model that incorporates hydrodynamic interactions and cell alignment forces to explain the migration mechanism. They validated their model through experiments with various cell lines, demonstrating the generality and robustness of the proposed mechanism.

Result: The study reveals that peripheral cell polarization and alignment are critical drivers of collective migration. The model-based predictions were experimentally confirmed, showing that the clusters can migrate without external cues and even reverse their migration direction.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the physical principles governing collective cell migration in the absence of external signals. The findings have significant implications for regenerative medicine, cancer therapy, and developmental biology, offering a foundation for controlling and engineering cell cluster dynamics.

Abstract: The collective migration of epithelial groups of cells plays a central role
in processes such as embryo development, wound healing, and cancer invasion.
While finite cell clusters are known to collectively migrate in response to
external gradients, the competing effect of possible endogenous cues is largely
unknown.Here, we demonstrate that the polarization of peripheral cells that
pull the cluster's edge outward is sufficient to induce and sustain the
collective migration of confluent clusters. We use a general continuum model to
show that the underlying shape-sensing mechanism is purely mechanical, relying
on long-range hydrodynamic interactions and cell-cell alignment forces. As a
proof-of-concept, we validate our findings with experiments on monolayer
clusters from various cell lines, where we control initial shapes and sizes.
The mechanism operates independently of external signals and will generally
interfere with them. Specifically, we predict and observe experimentally that
it can override collective durotaxis, reversing the direction of migration.
Together, our results offer a physical framework for understanding how cell
interactions govern the interplay between global shape and collective motion
and afford engineering principles for optimal control and manipulation of cell
cluster shape and motion.
