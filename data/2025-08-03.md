### [1] [Geometric phase in anisotropic Kepler problem: Perspective for realization in Rydberg atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23144)
*Nikolai A. Sinitsyn,Fumika Suzuki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper predicts a novel gyroscopic effect using Rydberg atoms, likened to the Foucault pendulum. It suggests achieving this effect through mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup within specific time frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research likely aims to explore fundamental physics in Rydberg atoms, possibly seeking applications in quantum systems or precision metrology.

Method: The approach involves studying the dynamics of a Rydberg atom under a Hamiltonian with specific anisotropy, analyzing the mechanism to replicate the Foucault effect.

Result: They demonstrate the feasibility of generating a geometric phase effect through controlled rotations, with results expected within 1 μs to 1 ms.

Conclusion: The findings open possibilities for experiments testing the relationship between quantum systems and macroscopic rotation, contributing to deeper understanding of angular momentum in such systems.

Abstract: We predict a gyroscopic effect that can be demonstrated with Rydberg atoms
following the dynamics of a Kepler Hamiltonian with an additional uniaxial
anisotropy induced by optical ponderomotive force. This effect is analogous to
the rotation of the Foucault pendulum in response to the Earth's rotation. We
argue that in Rydberg states a similar geometric angle can be generated by
mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s
and $1~$ms.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body
systems is a fundamental challenge in modern physics, with profound
implications for advancing quantum technologies. Typically, periodically driven
systems in the absence of conservation laws thermalize to a featureless
"infinite-temperature" state, erasing all memory of their initial conditions.
However, this paradigm can break down through mechanisms such as integrability,
many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert space
fragmentation. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical
freezing, a distinct mechanism of thermalization breakdown in driven systems,
and demonstrate its application in quantum sensing using an ensemble of
approximately $10^4$ interacting nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond. By
precisely controlling the driving frequency and detuning, we observe emergent
long-lived spin magnetization and coherent oscillatory micromotions, persisting
over timescales exceeding the interaction-limited coherence time ($T_2$) by
more than an order of magnitude. Leveraging these unconventional dynamics, we
develop a dynamical-freezing-enhanced ac magnetometry that extends optimal
sensing times far beyond $T_2$, outperforming conventional dynamical decoupling
magnetometry with a 4.3 dB sensitivity enhancement. Our results not only
provide clear experimental observation of dynamical freezing -- a peculiar
mechanism defying thermalization through emergent conservation laws -- but also
establish a robust control method generally applicable to diverse physical
platforms, with broad implications in quantum metrology and beyond.

### [3] [Reformulating Chemical Equilibrium in Reacting Quantum Gas Mixtures: Particle Number Conservation, Correlations and Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23132)
*Diogo J. L. Rodrigues*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a reformulation of the canonical-ensemble description for reactive quantum gas mixtures by incorporating a single global particle-number-conservation constraint, replacing chemical potentials. It explores quantum correlations and concentration fluctuations through an extended partition function, which leads to classical ideal gas behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for a more accurate statistical description of reactive quantum systems, integrating concepts from thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.

Method: The approach involves reformulating the canonical ensemble to include a constraint on global particle number conservation, studying how quantum correlations and concentration fluctuations emerge based on this constraint.

Result: The reformulated framework introduces naturally occurring quantum correlations and successfully models concentration fluctuations, reducing to classical behavior in appropriate limits.

Conclusion: This work offers a new theoretical framework for understanding equilibrium in quantum reactive systems, potentially applicable in various fields involving such systems.

Abstract: The canonical-ensemble description of reactive quantum gas mixtures is
reformulated by incorporating a single global particle-number-conservation
constraint over the combined spectra of inter-converting species. This
constraint replaces the conventional equality of chemical potentials.
Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein correlations naturally emerge across one-particle
energy eigenstates of species sharing identical spin-statistics, which in
ergodic single-systems manifest as intrinsic features of the equilibrium state.
By embedding all microstates linked by conversion pathways, the framework
incorporates concentration fluctuations in the statistical description. The
formalism offers fresh insights into quantum chemical equilibrium in reactive
mixtures with composition fluctuations and smoothly reduces to the classical
ideal gas limit via an extended partition function that generalizes classical
chemical-equilibrium treatments.

### [4] [Probing electronic state-dependent conformational changes in a trapped Rydberg ion Wigner crystal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23631)
*Marion Mallweger,Natalia Kuk,Vinay Shankar,Robin Thomm,Harry Parke,Ivo Straka,Weibin Li,Igor Lesanovsky,Markus Hennrich*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: State-dependent conformational changes are tough to observe in molecular dynamics, especially because they happen quickly. They're important for understanding how molecules change shapes. Using Rydberg ions as a model, the researchers find that they can emulate these changes. They showed this by exciting these ions, making them switch from a linear to a zigzag shape, which changes how they vibrate and what light they absorb. This is a big step in using Rydberg ions to simulate molecular behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how molecules change shape is crucial for many fields like biochemistry and materials science. Observing these changes can be tough due to their complexity and speed. Using quantum simulations, especially with Rydberg ions, might offer a realistic way to model these changes because Rydberg atoms are highly excited and can exhibit unusual quantum behavior that mirrors molecular dynamics.

Method: The researchers trapped ion crystals in their Wigner crystal state. They then excited one ion to a Rydberg state, causing it to alter the crystal structure. By adjusting the system near a structural phase transition, they observed the induced conformational change, leading to state-dependent hybridization of vibrational and electronic states. They looked for signatures in the Rydberg excitation to confirm the structural change.

Result: They successfully observed a state-dependent structural change in the ion crystal by exciting it to a Rydberg state. This change led to a strong hybridization of vibrational and electronic states, producing a detectable spectroscopic signature. This effect could be used to simulate complex molecular systems, advancing the field of quantum dynamic simulations.

Conclusion: By demonstrating artificial conformational changes in ion crystals using Rydberg excitation, the researchers pave the way for quantum simulations of molecular behavior. This could significantly enhance our ability to study complex molecular dynamics in various scientific fields.

Abstract: State-dependent conformational changes play a central role in molecular
dynamics, yet they are often difficult to observe or simulate due to their
complexity and ultrafast nature. One alternative approach is to emulate such
phenomena using quantum simulations with cold, trapped ions. In their
electronic ground state, these ions form long-lived Wigner crystals. When
excited to high-lying electronic Rydberg states, the ions experience a modified
trapping potential, resulting in a strong coupling between their electronic and
vibrational degrees of freedom. In an ion crystal, this vibronic coupling
creates electronic state-dependent potential energy surfaces that can support
distinct crystal structures -- closely resembling the conformational changes of
molecules driven by electronic excitations. Here, we present the first
experimental observation of this effect, by laser-coupling a single ion at the
centre of a three-ion crystal to a Rydberg state. By tuning the system close to
a structural phase transition, the excitation induces a state-dependent
conformational change, transforming the Wigner crystal from a linear to a
zigzag configuration. This structural change leads to a strong hybridisation
between vibrational and electronic states, producing a clear spectroscopic
signature in the Rydberg excitation. Our findings mark the first experimental
step towards using Rydberg ions to create and study artificial molecular
systems. change leads to a strong hybridisation between vibrational and
electronic states, producing a clear spectroscopic signature in the Rydberg
excitation. Our findings mark the first experimental step towards using Rydberg

### [5] [Field digitization scaling in a $\mathbb{Z}_N \subset U(1)$ symmetric model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22984)
*Gabriele Calliari,Robert Ott,Hannes Pichler,Torsten V. Zache*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach called field digitization scaling (FDS) to study the continuum limit of discrete quantum field theories. The authors use the renormalization group (RG) framework and effective field theory to develop scaling hypotheses involving the digitization parameter N. They apply their method to the 2D classical clock model, demonstrating a crossover transition as N varies. The study extends FDS to include the bond dimension χ in tensor network calculations, and establishes a connection between their classical models and quantum lattice gauge theories. The work provides a foundation for analyzing complex models in higher dimensions using FDS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of simulating quantum field theories (QFTs) by discretizing local fields, which is essential for numerical studies but often lacks an analytical framework. This motivates the introduction of FDS as a tool to understand the continuum limit in both classical and quantum contexts. The proposed approach aims to reconcile discrete models with continuum physics, potentially enabling more efficient simulations and analyses.

Method: The authors primarily use renormalization group (RG) theory and effective field theory. They develop generalized scaling hypotheses incorporating the digitization parameter N. Numerical tensor network methods are employed with finite bond dimension χ, and analytical techniques are applied to connect classical lattice models to quantum field theories in the ground state.

Result: The key results include the derivation of generalized scaling laws that relate different N-regularized models, the identification of a crossover transition dependent on N, and the demonstration that FDS can handle both bond dimension and digitization parameter fluctuations. They also establish a direct link between classical statistical mechanics models and quantum lattice gauge theories, which serves as a foundation for more complex simulations in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: This work provides a systematic framework for studying the continuum limit of discretized quantum field theories. By integrating concepts from statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, and numerical methods, FDS opens up new possibilities for analyzing complex models through digitization, bridging the gap between discrete simulations and continuum physics. This approach is particularly valuable for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena in both classical and quantum systems.

Abstract: The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum,
requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the
context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$
discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is
currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter
$N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example,
we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field
theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the
FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different
$N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\textit{field digitization
scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond
dimension $\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover
around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating
that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\chi$ and $N$. Finally,
we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the
ground state of a (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a
FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for
applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher
spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum
limit of digitized quantum field theories.

Conclusion: 该研究为无限测度空间中准概率分布的评估提供了广泛的方法，促进了量子资源理论的发展和量子光学的进步。

Abstract: Majorization theory is a powerful mathematical tool to compare the disorder
in distributions, with wide-ranging applications in many fields including
mathematics, physics, information theory, and economics. While majorization
theory typically focuses on probability distributions, quasiprobability
distributions provide a pivotal framework for advancing our understanding of
quantum mechanics, quantum information, and signal processing. Here, we
introduce a notion of majorization for continuous quasiprobability
distributions over infinite measure spaces. Generalizing a seminal theorem by
Hardy, Littlewood, and P\'olya, we prove the equivalence of four definitions
for both majorization and relative majorization in this setting. We give
several applications of our results in the context of quantum resource
theories, obtaining new families of resource monotones and no-goes for quantum
state conversions. A prominent example we explore is the Wigner function in
quantum optics. More generally, our results provide an extensive majorization
framework for assessing the disorder of integrable functions over infinite
measure spaces.

### [7] [Quantum scarring enhances non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23757)
*Aditya Banerjee*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses how quantum scars can enhance non-Markovian dynamics, including signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum systems far from equilibrium and non-thermalizing states is crucial for understanding complex dynamics in many-body systems.

Method: Numerical analysis of the PXP model and its deformations was used to examine the effects of scarring on non-Markovian behavior.

Result: Quantum scars enhance or erase subsystem non-Markovianity depending on the model's deformation.

Conclusion: This research provides new insights into the role of quantum scars in open quantum systems and their implications for non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an
open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary
evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the
latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization.
Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state
has spectral weight on the so-called quantum scar states, which are
non-thermalizing states embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal
states. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of
quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances
non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP
model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of
scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to
have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing
information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between
temporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of
subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that
scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished)
subsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories
associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the
interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to
investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum
many-body systems.

### [8] [Probing Bound State Relaxation Dynamics in Systems Out-of-Equilibrium on Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22988)
*Heba A. Labib,Goksu Can Toga,J. K. Freericks,A. F. Kemper*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a study using pump-probe spectroscopy on the mixed-field Ising model, demonstrating how quantum systems can be analyzed out-of-equilibrium without additional qubits. They investigate bound states, quench dynamics, and false vacuum decay, highlighting the potential of classical and quantum simulators in this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely aimed to showcase innovative methods to study non-equilibrium systems, possibly for advancing quantum computing applications or theoretical physics understanding.

Method: The authors used pump-probe spectroscopy to simulate experiments on the mixed-field Ising model, studying bound states, quench dynamics, and false vacuum decay without ancillary qubits.

Result: The study reveals insights into the behavior of quantum many-body systems under various quenches and the emergence of phenomena like Bloch oscillations.

Conclusion: The methodology positions pump-probe spectroscopy as a powerful tool for simulating out-of-equilibrium systems on both classical and quantum computers without needing extra qubits. This could enhance studies of complex systems and expand quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of
quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have
proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving,
and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use
this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the
longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the
spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the
discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under
different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and
then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study
false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the
ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the
emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived
oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating
systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe
experiments without needing ancillary qubits.

Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight simulation framework for evaluating
asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models.
We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is
established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to
generate entanglement simultaneously. We evaluate the performance of each
protocol using two key metrics: the fidelity of distributed entangled states,
and the hashing rate, a measure of entanglement efficiency. These metrics are
compared between both protocols across a range of network sizes and noise
parameters. We demonstrate that the parallel protocol consistently outperforms
the sequential, particularly in the hashing rate metric due to reduced runtime,
suggesting that parallel protocols are a strong candidate for a realizable
quantum Internet. Our framework offers an accessible and scalable tool for
evaluating entanglement distribution strategies, by reducing the simulation of
complex quantum processes to simple memory time calculations.

Result: 主要结果是发现如果初始状态和测量状态相关，重外交换后会保留LAQC。

Conclusion: 该研究为新量子相关性度量在量子重外交换中的应用提供理论支持。

Abstract: Although introduced originally for entanglement, quantum repeaters and
swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such
as quantum discord. Introduced by Mundarain and Ladr\'on de Guevara,
local-available quantum correlations (LAQC) are a promising yet understudied
quantum correlation. Recently, Bellor\'{\i}n et al. obtained exact analytical
results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Starting from
those previous results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for five families of
one-parameter 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial state
and the one used for the projective measurement are correlated, the final state
will have non-zero LAQC.

Abstract: We show an explicit $N$-qubit protocol involving one-axis-twisted spin
squeezed states, that allows for simultaneous phase and dephasing strength
estimation with precision that asymptotically matches fundamental quantum

at most constant asymptotic quantum enhancement, can be reduced to this problem
via an appropriately tailored quantum error-correction procedure.

*Clara Wassner,Jack Davis,Sacha Cerf,Ulysse Chabaud,Francesco Arzani*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a simplified method for certifying non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states using single quadrature measurements, showing theoretical and practical advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in quantum state reconstruction leads to the need for simplified certification methods, especially for non-Gaussian states which are crucial for quantum advantage tasks.

Method: The authors use single quadrature measurements (homodyne detection) and apply Hudson's theorem variant to witness non-Gaussianity based on homodyne distribution zeros, ensuring compactness for finite stellar rank states.

Result: The method allows certified non-Gaussianity detection with sample complexity, noise robustness, and practical experimental setups.

Conclusion: This reduces the measurement complexity required for quantum non-Gaussianity certification, opening new avenues in quantum information processing.

Abstract: Full reconstruction of quantum states from measurement samples is often a
prohibitively complex task, both in terms of the experimental setup and the
scaling of the sample size with the system. This motivates the relatively
easier task of certifying application-specific quantities using measurements
that are not tomographically complete, i.e. that provide only partial
information about the state related to the application of interest. Here, we
focus on simplifying the measurements needed to certify non-Gaussianity in
bosonic systems, a resource related to quantum advantage in various information
processing tasks. We show that the statistics of a single quadrature
measurement, corresponding to standard homodyne detection in quantum optics,
can witness arbitrary degrees of non-Gaussianity as quantified by stellar rank.
Our results are based on a version of Hudson's theorem for wavefunctions,
proved in a companion paper [1], revealing that the zeros in a homodyne
distribution are signatures of quantum non-Gaussianity and higher stellar
ranks. The validity of our witnesses is supported by a technical result showing
that sets of states with bounded energy and finite stellar rank are compact. We
provide an analysis of sample complexity, noise robustness, and experimental
prospects. Our work drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum
non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states. and experimental prospects. Our work
drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum non-Gaussianity in
bosonic quantum states.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a benchmark of various neural architectures for Quantum State Tomography (QST), finding that CNN and CGAN scale well and achieve high fidelity, while SVAE has moderate performance. Memristor-based platforms show promise for energy-efficient QST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies heavily on Quantum State Tomography, which faces challenges with scalability. This paper addresses the need for efficient and scalable architectures to enable practical use of QST.

Method: The authors benchmarked different neural networks against QST, evaluating their performance on reconstructing quantum states across varying qubit numbers and using two measurement strategies. They assessed scalability and energy efficiency of each architecture.

Result: CNNs and CGANs showed superior scaling and fidelity, with SVAE performing less well. Hardware considerations using memristors were explored for energy efficiency.

Conclusion: The study identifies effective scalable architectures for QST, paving the way for quantum-classical co-design with practical energy considerations.

Abstract: Quantum State Tomography (QST) is essential for characterizing and validating
quantum systems, but its practical use is severely limited by the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space and the number of measurements required for
informational completeness. Many prior claims of performance have relied on
architectural assumptions rather than systematic validation. We benchmark
several neural network architectures to determine which scale effectively with
qubit number and which fail to maintain high fidelity as system size
increases.To address this, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking of diverse
neural architectures across two quantum measurement strategies to evaluate
their effectiveness in reconstructing both pure and mixed quantum states. Our
results reveal that CNN and CGAN scale more robustly and achieve the highest
fidelities, while Spiking Variational Autoencoder (SVAE) demonstrates moderate
fidelity performance, making it a strong candidate for embedded, low-power
hardware implementations.Recognizing that practical quantum diagnostics will
require embedded, energy-efficient computation, we also discuss how
memristor-based Computation-in-Memory (CiM) platforms can accelerate these
models in hardware, mitigating memory bottlenecks and reducing energy
consumption to enable scalable in-situ QST. This work identifies which
architectures scale favorably for future quantum systems and lays the
groundwork for quantum-classical co-design that is both computationally and
physically scalable.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) with asymptotically lower overheads
than the surface code require non-local connectivity. Leveraging multi-layer
routing and long-range coupling capabilities in superconducting qubit hardware,
we develop Hardware-Aware Layout, HAL: a robust, runtime-efficient heuristic
algorithm that automates and optimizes the placement and routing of arbitrary
QECCs. Using HAL, we perform a comparative study of hardware cost across
various families of QECCs, including the bivariate bicycle codes, the
open-boundary tile codes, and the constant-depth-decodable radial codes. The
layouts produced by HAL confirm that open boundaries significantly reduce the
hardware cost, while incurring reductions in logical efficiency. Among the
best-performing codes were low-weight radial codes, despite lacking topological
structure. Overall, HAL provides a valuable framework for evaluating the
hardware feasibility of existing QECCs and guiding the discovery of new codes
compatible with realistic hardware constraints.

Conclusion: 该框架为不同量子系统中时间与能量的不确定性关系提供了统一的理论基础，并为量子测量中的时间探索提供了实验方法。

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time
distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The
time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a
measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form
$\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot
\delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This
bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that
time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the
framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy
uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent
driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and
matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing
quantum timing in controlled measurements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: trap ion quantum computers need efficient fluorescence collection, which is a key component for their performance and scalability. improving this would directly benefit the field of quantum computing, particularly in maintaining qubit states and performing operations. 

Method: the researchers developed a monolithically integrated system with a metalens on the backside of a surface ion trap. they used a 40x100 μm aperture achieving 0.91% simulated and 0.58% measured efficiency. by increasing the aperture area, they boosted efficiency to 3.17% which is comparable to conventional objectives. electrodes and apertures were co-optimized, and undercuts in the substrate maintained ion-substrate distance while improving efficiency. the metalens collimates fluorescence, avoiding the need for high numerical aperture objectives. they also discuss scalability with multiple readout zones. 

Result: successful demonstration of a metalens-based ion trap system with efficient fluorescence collection, showing significant improvements in efficiency and enabling scalable quantum computing solutions.

The potential for co-optimizing other components further highlights the research's significance in advancing quantum technologies. 

Abstract: A scaled trapped-ion quantum computer will require efficient fluorescence
collection across a large area. Here we propose and demonstrate a compact
monolithically integrated system featuring a metalens fabricated on the
backside of a surface ion trap. A 40$\times$100 $\mu$m aperture enables a
simulated point-source collection efficiency of 0.91% and a measured
point-source detection efficiency of 0.58%. Increasing the aperture area to
40$\times$600 $\mu$m boosts the simulated collection efficiency to
3.17%$-$comparable to that of a conventional objective with a numerical
aperture of 0.35. Further improvements are possible by co-optimizing the
electrode and aperture geometry. An undercut of the electrode substrate at the
aperture ensures a large distance between the ion and dielectric substrate
without compromising collection efficiency. The metalens directly collimates
the collected fluorescence, eliminating the need for a high numerical aperture
objective. An array of such readout zones will offer a compact, scalable
solution for high-fidelity parallel readout in next-generation trapped-ion
quantum processors.

### [18] [A Classical-Quantum Adder with Constant Workspace and Linear Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23079)
*Craig Gidney*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of classical-quantum adders aiming to achieve O(n) gate cost and O(1) ancilla qubits, similar to a previously found quantum adder. The authors present two adders: one using 3 clean ancillae and 4n±O(1) Toffoli gates, and another using 2 clean ancillae and n-2 dirty ancillae, with a Toffoli cost of 3n±O(1). Both constructions avoid additional workspace or Toffolis when conditioned on a control qubit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the open question of achieving the same asymptotic complexity as a quantum adder in classical-quantum adders. This is particularly relevant to optimizing modular arithmetic circuits, which often benefit from classical known offsets, making the work useful in quantum computing and cryptography.

Method: The authors construct two classical-quantum adders. The first uses 3 clean ancillae with 4n±O(1) Toffoli gates, while the second design optimizes to 3n±O(1) Toffoli gates using 2 clean and n-2 dirty ancillae. Both constructions do not require additional workspace or Toffoli gates when applying conditions based on a control qubit.

Result: The adders demonstrate improved gate costs and ancilla usage in classical-quantum adders, moving closer to the asymptotic complexity of quantum adders. This result is significant for optimizing modular arithmetic circuits, enhancing quantum computing applications.

Conclusion: The presented classical-quantum adders improve upon existing designs by reducing Toffoli gate costs and ancilla requirements, supporting more efficient modular arithmetic in quantum computing and cryptography.

Abstract: In 2004, Cuccaro et al found a quantum-quantum adder with $O(n)$ gate cost
and $O(1)$ ancilla qubits. Since then, it's been an open question whether
classical-quantum adders can achieve the same asymptotic complexity. These
costs are particularly relevant to modular arithmetic circuits, which often
offset by the classically known modulus.
  In this paper, I construct an adder that uses 3 clean ancillae and $4n \pm
O(1)$ Toffoli gates to add a classical offset into a quantum register. I also
present an adder with a Toffoli cost of $3n \pm O(1)$ that uses 2 clean
ancillae and $n-2$ dirty ancillae. I further show that applying the presented
adders conditioned on a control qubit requires no additional workspace or
Toffolis.

Abstract: Proximity measurements probe whether pairs of particles are close to one
another. We consider the impact of post-selected random proximity measurements
on a quantum fluid of many distinguishable particles. We show that such
measurements induce random spatial localization of a fraction of the particles,
and yet preserve homogeneity macroscopically. Eventually, all particles
localize, with a distribution of localization lengths that saturates at a scale
controlled by the typical measurement rate. The steady-state distribution of
these lengths is governed by a familiar scaling form.

Result: 常规纠缠分布协议的能量成本远高于基础下限，研究适用其他量子资源。

Conclusion: 纠缠生成需基础能量，影响未来量子通信技术的选择。

Abstract: Inspired by environmental sciences, we develop a framework to quantify the
energy needed to generate quantum entanglement via noisy quantum channels,
focusing on the hardware-independent, i.e. fundamental cost. Within this
framework, we define a measure of the minimal fundamental energy consumption
rate per distributed entanglement (expressed in Joule per ebit). We then derive
a lower bound on the energy cost of distributing a maximally entangled state
via a quantum channel, which yields a quantitative estimate of energy
investment per entangled bit for future quantum networks. We thereby show that
irreversibility in entanglement theory implies a non-zero energy cost in
standard entanglement distribution protocols. We further establish an upper
bound on the fundamental energy consumption rate of entanglement distribution
by determining the minimal energy required to implement quantum operations via
classical control. To this end, we formulate the axioms for an energy cost
measure and introduce a Hamiltonian model for classically-controlled quantum
operations. The fundamental cost is then defined as the infimum energy over all
such Hamiltonian protocols, with or without specific hardware constraints. The
study of the energy cost of a quantum operation is general enough to be
naturally applicable to quantum computing and is of independent interest.
Finally, we evaluate the energy demands of three entanglement distillation
protocols for photonic polarization qubits, finding that, due to entanglement
irreversibility, their required energy exceeds the fundamental lower bound by
many orders of magnitude. The introduced paradigm can be applied to other
quantum resources, with appropriate changes depending on their nature.

*Gerald Curran III,Luke J. Weaver,Zachary Rex,Ivan Biaggio*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals are analyzed considering exciton hopping between inequivalent sites. Quantum beats in fluorescence are predicted based on Monte Carlo simulations, showing dependence on hopping time and magnetic field. At zero magnetic field, complete global decoherence suppresses quantum beats, while different magnetic field strengths lead to varying decay rates of quantum beats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores quantum interference effects in organic molecular crystals which is relevant for understanding and controlling fluorescence properties, especially in applications like organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and quantum computing.

Method: The study employs a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze decoherence and fluorescence quantum beats in molecular crystals considering exciton hopping between different lattice sites and the influence of magnetic fields.

Result: The simulation shows that quantum beats can be completely suppressed under zero magnetic field due to global decoherence, and the decay rates of quantum beats vary with increasing magnetic field strength.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into how quantum interference and decoherence affect fluorescence in molecular crystals, which is crucial for optimizing devices that rely on fluorescence properties such as OLEDs and quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals
are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice
sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon
triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a
function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis.
Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global
decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero
magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates
depending on magnetic field strength.

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a critical step in continuous-variable quantum key
distribution (CV-QKD), especially in the finite-size regime where worst-case
confidence intervals can significantly reduce the achievable secret-key rate.
We provide a finite-size security analysis demonstrating that neural networks
can be reliably employed for parameter estimation in CV-QKD with quantifiable
failure probabilities $\epsilon_{PE}$, endowed with an operational
interpretation and composable security guarantees. Using a protocol that is
operationally equivalent to standard approaches, our method produces
significantly tighter confidence intervals, unlocking higher key rates even
under collective Gaussian attacks. The proposed approach yields tighter
confidence intervals, leading to a quantifiable increase in the secret-key rate
under collective Gaussian attacks. These results open up new perspectives for
integrating modern machine learning techniques into quantum cryptographic
protocols, particularly in practical resource-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究为非阿贝尔 anyon 在托普罗尔码中的应用提供了新的设计思路，展示了其在量子容错方面的潜力。

Abstract: Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and
manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been
systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the
non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error
correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag
qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over
those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian
anyon type. Furthermore, we present an approach for determining the optimal
threshold for non-Abelian TOs with perfect anyon syndromes for any noise model,
formulated as a statistical mechanics model using Bayesian inference. We
numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb
Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome
measurement, we find an optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an
intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already
gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$.
Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather
than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault
tolerance.

TL;DR: This paper presents a fast and scalable algorithm using variational Bayesian inference to identify quantum systems with high-dimensional parameters, demonstrating it with a nuclear spin quantum sensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a pressing challenge in quantum technology: efficiently identifying and understanding quantum systems in complex, multidimensional spaces, with applications across various fields.

Method: Utilizes variational Bayesian inference to approximate posterior distributions, enabling scalability and reduced computational costs. The algorithm includes regularization to select the simplest model explaining the data and separate degrees of freedom contributing to observed dynamics.

Result: The algorithm successfully identifies multiple nuclear spins with a single sensor, even with an unknown number of environmental spins. It processes data quickly, estimating dozens of parameters within minutes.

Conclusion: The framework shows great promise for quantum system identification, offering efficiency and scalability compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The advancement and scaling of quantum technology has made the learning and
identification of quantum systems and devices in highly-multidimensional
parameter spaces a pressing task for a variety of applications. In many cases,
the integration of real-time feedback control and adaptive choice of
measurement settings places strict demands on the speed of this task. Here we
present a joint model selection and parameter estimation algorithm that is fast
and operable on a large number of model parameters. The algorithm is based on
variational Bayesian inference (VBI), which approximates the target posterior
distribution by optimizing a tractable family of distributions, making it more
scalable than exact inference methods relying on sampling and that generally
suffer from high variance and computational cost in high-dimensional spaces. We
show how a regularizing prior can be used to select between competing models,
each comprising a different number of parameters, identifying the simplest
model that explains the experimental data. The regularization can further
separate the degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum systems in the environment or
processes, which contribute to major features in the observed dynamics, with
respect to others featuring small coupling, which only contribute to a
background. As an application of the introduced framework, we consider the
problem of the identification of multiple individual nuclear spins with a
single electron spin quantum sensor, relevant for nanoscale nuclear magnetic
resonance. With the number of environmental spins unknown a priori, our
Bayesian approach is able to correctly identify the model, i.e. the number of
spins and their couplings. We benchmark the algorithm on both simulated and
experimental data, using standard figures of merit, and demonstrating that we
can estimate dozens of parameters within minutes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in quantum computing applications as it's made available on GitHub.

Conclusion: OQTOPUS aims to democratize access to quantum computing, forming a developer community and advancing the field through open-source collaboration.

Abstract: Since the late 2010s, quantum computers have become commercially available,
and the number of services that users can run remotely via cloud servers is
increasing. In Japan, several domestic superconducting quantum computing
systems, including our own, began operation in 2023. However, the design of
quantum computing systems, especially in the most critical areas near quantum
computers, remains largely undisclosed, creating a significant barrier to entry
into the quantum computing field. If this situation continues, progress toward
standardization, which is essential for guiding quantum computer development,
will stall, and it will be difficult to develop a practical quantum computing
system that can perform calculations on a supercomputer scale. To address this
issue, we propose Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators and USers (OQTOPUS), a
full-stack quantum computing system developed from research with real quantum
computers. OQTOPUS is one of the world's largest open-source software projects,
covering operational software from cloud-based execution environment
construction to system operation. Furthermore, to perform quantum computing
effectively and efficiently, it implements key features, such as transpilers,
multiprogramming, and error mitigation, in an area as close as possible to a
quantum computer, an area that system vendors rarely disclose. Finally, this
study presents experimental results of applying OQTOPUS to a real quantum
computer. OQTOPUS is publicly available on GitHub and will notably lower the
barrier to entry into the quantum computing field, contributing to the
formation of a quantum computing developer community through open discussion.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing new schemes using SPDC sources, achieving specific rate improvements and practical performance, making DI QKD more viable for real-world applications.

Method: The paper discusses methods involving SPDC-based entanglement distribution, key rate analysis with sqrt(η) scaling, security proofs using Entropy Accumulation Theorem and custom Bell certificates, and demonstrates lower detector efficiency requirements (83%).

Result: The proposed schemes achieve positive key rates at 83% detector efficiency, matching the advantages of twin-field protocols, with their security validated using advanced entropy theorem and optimized Bell certificates, offering significant improvements over standard approaches at maximum transmission distances.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for practical and secure long-distance DI QKD implementation using SPDC-based methods, integrating proven security techniques and efficient experimental results. It signifies a crucial step towards real-world quantum communication networks with device-independent security.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI QKD) offers unparalleled
cryptographic security by eliminating trust requirements for quantum devices,
yet has remained impractical for long-distance implementation due to
fundamental rate limitations. Here, we propose the first experimentally viable
schemes for long-distance DI QKD using two fully photonic approaches with
heralded entanglement distribution using spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC) sources. Both schemes achieve key rate scaling with the square root of
channel transmissivity $\eta_t$, matching the twin-field protocol advantage
rather than the prohibitive linear decay of conventional QKD. We demonstrate
positive key rates at detector efficiencies as low as 83\%, bringing DI QKD
within reach of the current superconducting detector technology. Our security
analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem to establish rigorous
finite-size bounds, while numerical optimization yields custom Bell
certificates that surpass standard approaches by 2--3 times at maximum
transmission distances. This work represents a critical milestone toward
device-independent security in quantum communication networks, providing
experimentalists with practical implementation pathways while maintaining the
strongest possible security guarantees against quantum adversaries.

Motivation: The paper presents a novel approach to quantum adiabatic theory, emphasizing geometric aspects and electromagnetic analogies, which could offer new insights into quantum systems and their topological properties.

Method: The authors reformulate the theory using an emergent electromagnetic approach, derive Berry Maxwell equations by analogy to classical electrodynamics, and construct Berry electric and magnetic fields from quantum potentials.

Result: By constructing Berry Maxwell equations, the paper unifies static and dynamic geometric phases, identifies topological features, and provides a framework for quantum transport and phase classification.

Conclusion: This work presents a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, offering a comprehensive covariant formalism that unifies and extends previous geometric phase theories, with significant implications for quantum physics fields.

Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an
emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of
geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches,
we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with
dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to
define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between
static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how
gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct
Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining
Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector
potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations
explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity
and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological
charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space,
and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like
expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime
of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and
time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications
extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of
phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems
driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.

quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable
color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of
4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for
integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. However, the deterministic
integration of single spin defects into high-performance photonic cavities on
this platform has remained a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the
deterministic and scalable coupling of both ensemble (PL4) and single PL6 spin
defects into monolithic bullseye cavities on the 4H-SiCOI platform. By tuning
the cavity resonance, we achieve a 40-fold enhancement of the zero-phonon line
(ZPL) intensity from ensemble PL4 defects, corresponding to a Purcell factor of
approximately 5.0. For deterministically coupled single PL6 defects, we observe
a threefold increase in the saturated photon count rate, confirm single-photon
emission, and demonstrate coherent control of the spin state through optically
detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), resonant excitation, and Rabi oscillations.
These advancements establish a viable pathway for developing scalable,
high-performance SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的增强双向量子位传输鲁棒性的新策略，通过弱测量和环境辅助方法，优化了 fidelity 和 success 概率的平衡，提升了 BQT 的整体性能。

Abstract: This paper presents strategies for enhancing the robustness of bidirectional
quantum teleportation (BQT) through environment-assisted and weak measurement
techniques. BQT is a crucial component of distributed quantum networks,
allowing for the bilateral transfer of quantum information between two nodes.
While perfect teleportation necessitates maximally entangled states, these are
vulnerable to degradation due to inherent decoherence. We propose a BQT scheme
that enables the bilateral transfer of arbitrary qubits between nodes via
amplitude damping channels (ADC), aiming to optimize fidelity using weak
measurements in the final step of the process. Environment-assisted
measurements (EAM) are used to establish a four-qubit channel composed of two
Bell states. We explore two situations: (I) where only the recovery qubits pass
through amplitude damping channels and (II) where the entire four-qubit channel
is subjected to ADC. Our findings demonstrate a balance between average
fidelity and success probability when the weak measurement strength ($q_w$) is
constrained by the decay rate ($p$), specifically $q_w \in {[0,p]}$. Perfect
BQT is achieved when $q_w = p$, indicating complete suppression of ADC effects.
On the other hand, a decline in both average fidelity and success probability
is noted when the weak measurement strength surpasses the ADC strength, marking
the prohibited domain as $q_w \in {(p,1]}$. Additionally, our secured BQT
protocol consistently outperforms the unprotected scheme in both scenarios,
highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed protection strategies.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子金融计算提供了新的框架和方法，展示了二次加速的可能性。

Abstract: Quantum entanglement enables exponential computational states, while
superposition provides inherent parallelism. Consequently, quantum circuits are
theoretically capable of supporting large scale parallel computation. However,
applying them to financial analysis particularly in the areas of random number
generation and payoff computation remains a significant challenge. Experts
generally believe that quantum computing relies on matrix operations, which are
deterministic in nature without randomness. This inherent determinism makes it
particularly challenging to design quantum circuits that require random number
injection. JP Morgan[1] introduced the piecewise linear (PWL) approach for
modeling payoff computations but did not disclose a quantum circuit capable of
identifying values exceeding the strike price, suggesting a possible reliance
on classical pre processing for interval classification. This paper presents an
integrated quantum circuit with two key components: one for random number
injection, applicable to risk assessment, and the other for direct payoff
computation, relevant to financial pricing. These components are compatible
with a scalable framework that leverages large scale parallelism and Quantum
Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to achieve quadratic speedup. The circuit was
implemented on IBM Qiskit and evaluated using 8 parallel threads and 1600
measurement shots. Results confirmed both the presence of randomness and the
correctness of payoff computation. While the current implementation uses 8
threads, the design scales to 2 to the power of n threads, for arbitrarily
large n, offering a potential path toward demonstrating quantum supremacy.

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a crucial technique for suppressing errors
especially in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, enabling more reliable
quantum computation without the overhead of full error correction. Zero-Noise
Extrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent
quantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as
iterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's
effectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based
on such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires
substantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight,
extrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum
algorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method
characterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the
full algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the
block fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success
probability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's
algorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real
127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise
environment. Our results, particularly those from Aer simulator, demonstrate
that the core block's error follows a highly consistent exponential decay. This
allows our technique to achieve robust error mitigation, overcoming the
limitations of conventional ZNE which is often compromised by statistically
unreliable data from near-random behavior under heavy noise. In low-noise
conditions, our method approaches theoretical success probability, outperforms
ZNE. In high-noise conditions, ZNE fails to mitigate errors due to overfitting
of its extrapolation data, whereas our method achieves over a 20% higher
success probability.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines various quantum Brownian motion models within stochastic thermodynamics, finding that while the Caldeira-Leggett master equation has desirable thermodynamic features, it doesn’t ensure complete positivity. CPTP extensions, however, lead to issues like violated detailed balance and thermodynamic anomalies.

Motivation: Understanding the thermodynamic behavior of quantum systems, especially open systems interacting with environments, is crucial for developing accurate models in quantum technologies and statistical mechanics.

Method: The authors analyze quantum Brownian motion models using the Caldeira-Leggett master equation and various CPTP extensions, employing stochastic thermodynamics to evaluate their thermodynamic properties, particularly focusing on detailed balance and entropy production.

Result: The Caldeira-Leggett equation meets thermodynamic criteria but violates complete positivity, whereas CPTP extensions have thermodynamic contradictions, such as violating detailed balance and resulting in non-vanishing entropy production and unclear non-equilibrium currents.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the challenge in reconciling quantum consistency with thermodynamic equilibration in open quantum systems, indicating a need for further research into compatible models that address these issues.

Abstract: We rigorously analyze the non-equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of various
formulations of quantum Brownian motion (QBM) using the framework of stochastic
thermodynamics. While the widely used Caldeira-Leggett master equation exhibits
desirable thermodynamic features, such as the fulfilment of a detailed balance,
it fails to ensure complete positivity. In contrast, several completely
positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) extensions turn out to be
thermodynamically controversial. We show that such extensions introduce
anomalous phase-space structures that violate detailed balance at the steady
state, leading to non-vanishing entropy production and effective
non-equilibrium current of unclear physical origins. Our results highlight a
fundamental tension between quantum consistency and thermodynamic equilibration
in open quantum systems.

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a fully passive discrete-state continuous-variable
quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), which can eliminate all modulator side
channels on the source side, using a local local oscillator (LLO). The CV-QKD
system achieves a maximum transmission length of 100 km with a repetition rate
of 1 GHz using specially designed phase rotation and discretization methods,
and the corresponding secret key bit rate is 127 kbps, as estimated based on
the amplitude of prepared states at the transmitter, as well as the first- and
second-order moments of quadratures at the receiver by employing the convex
optimization without imposing any assumptions on the quantum channel. The
performance of the protocol is similar to that of modulated CV LLO protocols
and better than those of passive discrete-variable and CV protocols. Our
protocol is expected to play an important role in the quantum metropolitan area
networks and quantum access networks with high realistic security.

Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind grokking and generalization in quantum machine learning is crucial for optimizing these models.

Method: Used matrix product states, tracked metrics like entanglement entropy and information theory tools for analysis.

Result: grokking in fashion MNIST correlated with entanglement transitions, while hyper-spectral models showed distinct behavior, highlighting the importance of information dynamics.

Conclusion: Proposed framework to analyze generalization in quantum machine learning, suggesting potential for developing robust models.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced machine learning, encompassing both quantum algorithms and
quantum-inspired classical methods such as tensor networks, offers promising
tools for extracting structure from complex, high-dimensional data. In this
work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers
applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyper-spectral
satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of
grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking
entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across
training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain
deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between
label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from
synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show
that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement
transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted
hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings
highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired
learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in
multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret
generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.

### [37] [Universal tradeoff relations between resource cost and irreversibility of channels: General-resource Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorems and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23760)
*Hiroyasu Tajima,Koji Yamaguchi,Ryuji Takagi,Yui Kuramochi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes a fundamental connection between quantum resource costs and irreversibility, showing that lower irreversibility leads to higher resource requirements. This is achieved through universal trade-offs applicable across various quantum resources. The results have broad implications, offering insights into energy-error tradeoffs, resource costs in measurements and work, generalized Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorems, and the necessity for infinite costs in certain operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a critical challenge in quantum technologies: understanding resource costs in quantum processes while accounting for irreversibility. This is crucial because quantum technologies, though powerful, require optimizing resource usage without compromising their effectiveness.

Method: The authors employ quantum resource theories to analyze and quantify the relationship between irreversibility and resource costs. They use trade-off laws for various resources to derive universal bounds and apply these to specific cases such as energy and measurements.

Result: A universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff is proven for a wide range of resources, leading to key findings including energy-error tradeoffs, cost relations in work and measurements, generalized measurement limitations, and the necessity of infinite costs for certain non-increasing operations.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational framework linking quantum resources and irreversibility, advancing our understanding of quantum computation and information by showing how quantumness can influence and potentially suppress irreversibility in processes.

Abstract: Quantum technologies offer exceptional -- sometimes almost magical -- speed
and performance, yet every quantum process costs physical resources. Designing
next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following
question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a
desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum
resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the
lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required
resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of
resources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others --
yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope
positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results:
(1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the
irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff
for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to
free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem,
which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a
wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing
resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource
cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in
fact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal
relationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step
toward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can
suppress irreversibility.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of establishing a global quantum internet by proposing a satellite-based approach, which enhances security and coverage. It uses QKD protocols optimized for high loss, making it feasible for real-world applications.

Method: Simulation-based analysis comparing twin-field and mode-pairing QKD with varying ground telescope sizes, using adaptive optics-corrected communication channels.

Result: Experiments show high secret key rates with small ground telescopes, indicating scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed network design is viable and scalable, offering a practical route for building a global quantum internet.

Abstract: In pursuit of a global quantum key distribution (QKD) network, a service
based on untrusted nodes on geostationary satellites could offer wide coverage,
continuous operation, and enhanced security compared to the trusted node
alternative. Although this scenario has been studied for entanglement-based
protocols, such an approach would require large-area telescopes both on the
ground and in space. In this work, we analyze the performance of two QKD
protocols well adapted to this scenario, namely twin-field (TF) and
mode-pairing (MP) QKD, which exhibit high resilience to high-loss channels.
Leveraging an in-depth simulation of communication channels corrected with
adaptive optics, we assess the expected secret key rates for both protocols in
a configuration involving two 50 cm telescopes on board the satellite and
ground-based telescopes ranging from 20 cm to 1 m in aperture. Our results show
that, in the best case and considering realistic detectors, it is possible to
achieve secret key rates on the order of a few hundred bit/s for both TF and
MP-QKD. We show, notably, that secret key generation is potentially feasible
even with 20 cm ground telescopes, highlighting the high scalability potential
of such a configuration.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger wavefunction is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics, quantum
chemistry, and bosonic quantum information theory. Its zero-set for fermionic
systems is well-studied and central for determining chemical properties, yet
for bosonic systems the zero-set is less understood, especially in the context
of characterizing non-classicality. Here we study the zeros of such
wavefunctions and give them a novel information-theoretic interpretation. Our
main technical result is showing that the wavefunction of most bosonic quantum
systems can be extended to a holomorphic function over the complex plane,
allowing the application of powerful techniques from complex analysis. As a
consequence, we prove a version of Hudson's theorem for the wavefunction and
characterize Gaussian dynamics as classical motion of the wavefunction zeros.
Our findings suggest that the non-Gaussianity of quantum optical states can be
detected by measuring a single quadrature of the electromagnetic field, which
we demonstrate in a companion paper [1]. More generally, our results show that
the non-Gaussian features of bosonic quantum systems are encoded in the zeros
of their wavefunction.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive classification of one-dimensional coined quantum
walks on the infinite line, focusing on the spatial probability distributions
they induce. Building on prior results, we identify all initial coin states
that lead to symmetric quantum walks for arbitrary coins, and provide a
bijective parametrisation of all symmetric quantum walks modulo distributional
equivalence. Extending beyond the symmetric case, we also give a surjective
parametrisation of all coined quantum walks under the same equivalence relation
and a bijective parametrisation modulo equivalence of the walks' limiting
distributions.
  Furthermore, we derive corrected closed-form expressions for the walk
amplitudes, resolving inaccuracies in previous literature, and generalise the
approach to the correlated classical random walk. This unified framework
enables a direct comparison between quantum and classical dynamics.
Additionally, we discuss the asymptotic scaling of variances for both models,
identifying quadratic spreading as a hallmark of non-trivial quantum walks and
contrasting it with the linear behaviour of classical walks, except at the
extremal points of maximal correlation. Finally, we compare the limiting
distributions arising from quantum walks with the ones in the classical case.

Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitive dark matter detection, particularly using
nonclassical states, such as Schr\"odinger cat states featuring sub-Planck
interference structures in microwave cavities. Here, we report the first
experimental application of four-component Schr\"odinger cat states within a
high-quality superconducting microwave cavity to detect dark photons, a

signal photon rate and constrain the dark photon kinetic mixing angle to an
unprecedented $\epsilon < 7.32 \times 10^{-16}$ near 6.44~GHz (26.6~$\mu$eV).
By employing a parametric sideband drive to actively tune the cavity frequency,
we achieve dark photon searches and background subtraction across multiple
frequency bins, yielding a sensitivity at the $10^{-16}$ level within a 100~kHz

light-matter quasi-BIC is formed at a critical coupling condition via
collectively induced absorption, which is produced by quantum interference
between edge and bulk states. We uncover the time-reversed relation between
topological quasi-BIC and light amplification. Interestingly, one can realize a
directional ultranarrow amplifier by means of critical coupling. Our work
demonstrates an unconventional quasi-BIC at a topological quantum optics
interface with potential applications in quantum devices.

Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum
mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally
compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg
quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that
in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can
still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized
(non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution.
They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures
on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups.
We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with
the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a
compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian
groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.

Abstract: The existence of electromagnetic radiation - radio-waves, microwaves, light,
x-rays and so on - is one of the most important physical phenomena, and our
ability to manipulate them is one of the most significant technological
achievement of humankind. Underlying this ability is our understanding of how
radiation is produced: whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates.
Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here we
prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without
radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple
(once one knows what to do) but its reasons are deep: it relies on the fact
that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act
on them, via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here
is just them tip of an iceberg - it implies the need to reconsider the basic
understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far
beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何有效利用量子处理器的限制性连接性，通过交换网络改进架构，提升了量子神经网络的训练能力和效率。

Abstract: Efficient parametrizations of quantum states are essential for trainable
hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. A key challenge in their design consists
in adapting to the available qubit connectivity of the quantum processor, which
limits the capacity to generate correlations between distant qubits in a
resource-efficient and trainable manner. In this work we first introduce an
algorithm that optimizes qubit routing for arbitrary connectivity graphs,
resulting in a swap network that enables direct interactions between any pair
of qubits. We then propose a co-design of circuit layers and qubit routing by
embedding the derived swap networks within layered, connectivity-aware
ans\"atze. This construction significantly improves the trainability of the
ansatz, leading to enhanced performance with reduced resources. We showcase
these improvements through ground-state simulations of strongly correlated
systems, including spin-glass and molecular electronic structure models. Across
exemplified connectivities, the swap-enhanced ansatz consistently achieves
lower energy errors using fewer entangling gates, shallower circuits, and fewer
parameters than standard layered-structured baselines. Our results indicate
that swap network augmented ans\"atze provide enhanced trainability and
resource-efficient design to capture complex correlations on devices with
constrained qubit connectivity.

Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the

can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we
demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes
can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time
measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire
network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum
reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a
non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new
strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) has potential for a scientific revolution
through numerous practical applications like finding better medicines,
batteries, materials, catalysts etc. Many QPE algorithms use the Hadamard test
to estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$ for a large integer $k$ for an
efficiently preparable initial state $|\psi\rangle$ and an efficiently
implementable unitary operator $U$. The Hadamard test is hard to implement
because it requires controlled applications of $U^{k}$. Recently, a Sequential
Hadamard test (SHT) was proposed (arXiv:2506.18765) which requires controlled
application of $U$ only but its total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ scales as
$\mathcal{O}(k^{3}/\epsilon^{2}r_{\rm min}^{2})$ where $r_{\rm min}$ is the
minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{k'}|\psi\rangle|$ among all integers $k'
\leq k$. Typically $r_{\rm min}$ is exponentially low and SHT becomes too slow.
We present a new algorithm, the SANDWICH test to address this bottleneck. Our
algorithm uses efficient preparation of the initial state $|\psi\rangle$ to
efficiently implement the SPROTIS operator $R_{\psi}^{\phi}$ where SPROTIS
stands for the Selective Phase Rotation of the Initial State. It sandwiches the
SPROTIS operator between $U^{a}$ and $U^{b}$ for integers $\{a,b\} \leq k$ to
estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$. The total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ is
$\mathcal{O}(k^{2}\ln k/ \epsilon^{2} s_{\rm min}^{6})$. Here $s_{\rm min}$ is
the minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{\hat{k}}|\psi\rangle$ among all integers
$\hat{k}$ which are values of the nodes of a random binary sum tree whose root
node value is $k$ and leaf nodes' values are $1$ or $0$. It can be reasonably
expected that $s_{\rm min} \not\ll 1$ in typical cases because there is wide
freedom in choosing the random binary sum tree.

Motivation: 研究者们试图理解在何种情况下量子算法可以显著加快计算速度，特别是对于搜索和计数这类问题。这与量子力学中的反演操作相关。

Method: 作者使用了压缩oracle方法，构建了实例证明在无法逆操作的情况下，量子算法无法超越原始方法。

Result: 在缺乏逆操作的情况下，量子算法无法提供加速，如在量子学习、测量和 sensing中的应用。

Conclusion: 逆操作对量子加速至关重要。

Abstract: We prove that the generic quantum speedups for brute-force search and
counting only hold when the process we apply them to can be efficiently
inverted. The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification
and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation
unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$; we give problem instances based on
trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only $U$ beats the naive,
quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the
compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are
responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum
algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in
the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings,
$U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$
can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our
result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are
scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound.

### [49] [Exciton Berryology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22983)
*Henry Davenport,Johannes Knolle,Frank Schindler*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study introduces Berry connections for excitons in semiconductors, defines a projected position operator to distinguish Berry phases for electrons and holes, and extends the concept of shift excitons using symmetry principles. The formalism avoids smooth gauge and provides a gauge-invariant measure for exciton polarization, applicable under group symmetries and using discrete Wilson loops for numerical calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is motivated by the desire to better understand the role of Berry phases in excitation states, particularly in solids, and to connect these phases to measurable properties like polarization. The study builds on modern theories of polarization and aims to provide a framework for calculating and interpreting exciton Berry phases in various symmetric environments.

Method: The research method involves defining an exciton projected position operator, calculating Berry phases for electrons and holes, and utilizing discrete Wilson loops without requiring a smooth gauge. It also derives expressions for exciton polarization under different symmetries, including crystalline symmetries like inversion and C2T symmetry, and validates the approach through numerical examples.

Result: The study successfully formulates a method to compute Berry connections and exciton polarization for various symmetries, offering a new way to diagnose topological exciton bands and understand their polarization. The findings are supported by theoretical derivations and potentially applicable to numerical calculations using Wilson loops.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a robust theoretical framework for analyzing exciton Berry phases and polarization in semiconductors, with applications in understanding topological properties and deviations from shift exciton behavior under different symmetry conditions. It bridges the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and practical characterization of excitonic states in solid-state systems.

Abstract: In translationally invariant semiconductors that host exciton bound states,
one can define an infinite number of possible exciton Berry connections. These
correspond to the different ways in which a many-body exciton state, at fixed
total momentum, can be decomposed into free electron and hole Bloch states that
are entangled by an exciton envelope wave function. Inspired by the modern
theory of polarization, we define an exciton projected position operator whose
eigenvalues single out two unique choices of exciton Berry phase and associated
Berry connection - one for electrons, and one for holes. We clarify the
physical meaning of these exciton Berry phases and provide a discrete Wilson
loop formulation that allows for their numerical calculation without a smooth
gauge. As a corollary, we obtain a gauge-invariant expression for the exciton
polarisation at a given total momentum, i.e. the mean separation of the
electron and hole within the exciton wave function. In the presence of
crystalline inversion symmetry, the electron and hole exciton Berry phases are
quantized to the same value and we derive how this value can be expressed in
terms of inversion eigenvalues of the many-body exciton state. We then consider
crystalline $C_2 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry, for which no symmetry eigenvalues are
available as it is anti-unitary, and confirm that the exciton Berry phase
remains quantized and still diagnoses topologically distinct exciton bands. Our
theory thereby generalizes the notion of shift excitons, whose exciton Wannier
states are displaced from those of the non-interacting bands by a quantized
amount, beyond symmetry indicators.

Abstract: We theoretically explore higher-order topological magnons in collinear
altermagnets, encompassing a dimensional hierarchy ranging from localized
corner modes to propagating hinge excitations. By employing antiferromagnetic
interlayer coupling in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian, our work
reveals anisotropic surface states and spatially distributed hinge modes within
AA-type stacking configurations. We track the adiabatic evolution of Wannier
centers to identify the bulk-polarization with second-order topological magnon
insulator (SOTMI), where various magnon spectra demonstrate symmetry-protected
band structure beyond conventional topology. Harnessing the stability and
propagative properties of hinge modes, our study offers a potential platform
for magnonic quantum information processing in altermagnetic systems that
performs energy-efficient logic operation.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the topological phase transition in Sb from semimetal to insulator due to quantum confinement. Through experiments, they observe the evolution of electronic structure with film thickness, including band gap appearance and changes in transport properties, supporting theoretical predictions of Bi1-xSbx topological states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by interest in understanding topological phase transitions in elemental semiconductors, aiming to provide insights into material properties for spintronics and quantum technologies.

Method: The researchers used molecular beam epitaxy to grow Sb films and employed electrical transport measurements, ARPES, and magnetoresistance studies to characterize the electronic structure transitions.

Result: Experiments confirm the suppression of quantum spin Hall effect with thicker films, showing the expected quantum confinement effects, while thinner films reveal gap opening, consistent with topological insulator behavior.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for exploring topological phases in Sb and similar materials, potentially useful for hybrid systems and spintronic applications.

Abstract: Antimony (Sb), an element with strong spin-orbit coupling, is predicted to
undergo a topological phase transition from a topological semimetal to a
topological insulator as its dimensionality approaches the two-dimensional
limit, driven by the quantum confinement effect. In this study, we investigate
this transition in Sb thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, employing
electrical transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). Electrical transport measurements revealed signatures of a modified
electronic band structure, including a Hall response with multiple carrier
types, a decreasing carrier concentration, and a transition in the curvature of
the longitudinal resistance from quadratic to linear with decreasing film
thickness. Temperature-dependent magnetoresistance further showed weak
antilocalization below 16 K, indicating strong spin-orbit coupling and
suggesting the presence of non-trivial topological states. Analysis of the WAL
characteristics revealed a single coherent conducting channel and a
thickness-dependent change in the phase decoherence mechanism. Complementary
ARPES measurements confirmed that reducing the film thickness lifts the
conduction band at the M-point, consistent with the emergence of a band gap.
These findings support theoretical predictions of a thickness-dependent band
structure evolution driven by the quantum confinement effect, providing a
foundation for further exploration of topological phase transitions in Sb as
well as Bi1-xSbx. The realization of an elemental topological material with
simplified stoichiometry and semiconductor compatibility presents a promising
avenue for next-generation hybrid systems and applications in spintronics and
quantum technologies.

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor and quantum Fisher information have recently
been shown to provide a unified geometric description of the linear response of
many-body systems. However, a similar geometric description of higher-order
perturbative phenomena including nonlinear response in generic quantum systems
is lacking. In this work, we develop a general framework for the time-dependent
quantum geometry of many-body systems by treating external perturbing fields as
coordinates on the space of density matrices. We use the Bures distance between
the initial and time-evolved density matrix to define geometric quantities
through a perturbative expansion. To lowest order, we derive a time-dependent
generalization of the Bures metric related to the spectral density of linear
response functions, unifying previous results for the quantum metric in various
limits and providing a geometric interpretation of Fermi's golden rule. At next
order in the expansion, we define a time-dependent Bures-Levi-Civita connection
for general many-body systems. We show that the connection is the sum of one
contribution that is related to a second-order nonlinear response function, and
a second contribution that captures the higher geometric structure of
first-order perturbation theory. We show that in the quasistatic,
zero-temperature limit for noninteracting fermions, this Bures connection
reduces to the known expression for band-theoretic Christoffel symbols. Our
work provides a systematic framework to explore many-body quantum geometry
beyond the quantum metric and highlights how higher-order correlation functions
can probe this geometry.

TL;DR: The paper discusses topological insulators with intrinsic alternated magnetic features, protected by specific symmetries. It introduces models for both 2D and 3D systems, uses spin Chern numbers as a topological invariant, and identifies symmetry-protected boundary modes. The work bridges alternated magnetism with topological quantum matter and provides a framework for spintronic systems. The findings are significant as they offer new insights into topological phases and potential applications in next-generation electronics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is interested because it combines topological insulators with magnetic materials, which could lead to new types of spintronic devices. The use of combined symmetries to protect topological phases is intriguing as it might offer more robust materials for future applications in electronics and quantum computing.

Method: The paper employs theoretical models in two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems, utilizing spin Chern numbers as a topological invariant. They analyze symmetry-protected boundary modes in systems with specific magnetic symmetries, including alternated magnetic moments, and compute topological invariants to characterize the phases.

Result: The models presented show that alternated magnetic features can lead to topological phases protected by specific symmetries. Spin Chern numbers are effective in describing these phases, and the boundary modes, such as corner, hinge, and surface states, are identified based on magnetic symmetries and local moments. The work also highlights the potential for engineering spintronic systems without net magnetization.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges alternated magnetism with topological quantum matter, providing a theoretical framework for the design and engineering of spintronic systems. These systems, characterized by intrinsic alternated magnetic fields, offer potential for advanced quantum devices without net magnetization, which is a significant step forward in both fundamental physics and technological applications. The approach could inspire further research into topological phases in materials with magnetic order and has implications for spintronics and quantum computing.

Abstract: We present models of topological insulating Hamiltonians exhibiting intrinsic
altermagnetic features, protected by combined three-fold or four-fold
rotational symmetries with time-reversal. We demonstrate that the spin Chern
number serves as a robust topological invariant in two-dimensional systems,
while for three-dimensional structures, the topological nature is characterized
by the spin Chern numbers computed on the $k_z$=$0$ and $k_z$=$\pi$ planes. The
resulting phases support symmetry-protected boundary modes, including corner,
hinges and surface states, whose structure is determined by the magnetic
symmetry and the local magnetic moments. Our findings bridge the fields of
altermagnetism and topological quantum matter, and establish a theoretical
framework for engineering spintronic topological systems without net
magnetization.

Abstract: Single atomic adsorbates on ultrathin insulating films provide a promising
route toward bottom-up quantum architectures based on atomically identical yet
individually addressable spin qubits on solid surfaces. A key challenge in
engineering quantum-coherent spin nanostructures lies in understanding and
controlling the spin state of individual adsorbates. In this work, we
investigate single titanium (Ti) atoms adsorbed on MgO/Ag(100) surfaces using a
combined scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. Our
measurements reveal two distinct spin states, $S = 1/2$ and $S = 1$, depending
on the local adsorption site and the thickness of the MgO film. Density
functional theory calculations suggest a Ti$^+$ configuration for the Ti
adsorbates with approximately 3 electrons in the 4$s$ and 3$d$ valence shells.
Using a multi-orbital atomic multiplet calculations the site dependence of the
spin can be rationalized as a charge redistribution between spin-polarizing and
depolarizing orbitals. These findings underscore the potential of
surface-supported single atoms as spin qubits with tunable spin and charge
states, enabling atom-by-atom control in the realization of a versatile quantum
platform on surfaces.

Abstract: The detection and manipulation of the spin configurations in layered magnetic
semiconductors hold significant interest for developing spintronic devices in
two-dimensional limit. In this letter, we report a systematical study on the
photoluminescence (PL) from the high energy excitons in few-layer CrSBr and its
application on detecting the spin configurations. Besides the broad excitonic
emission peak (Xl) at around 1.34 eV, we also observed another strong excitonic
emission peak (Xh) at around 1.37 eV in hBN encapsulated 2L sample, which
splits into two peaks in 3L and 4L samples. With help of the first principles
calculations, we conclude that the Xh peak is associated with the transition
between the top valence band and the second lowest conduction band, which is
forbidden by the inversion symmetry in 1L CrSBr. Furthermore, the position and
intensity of the Xh peak are strongly dependent on the interlayer magnetic
order of the CrSBr samples, which provides an efficient way to probe their spin
configurations. In addition, when the magnetic field is applied at the easy
axis direction, we resolve an intermediate magnetic state besides the

Motivation: The researchers are likely motivated by the study of low-dimensional quantum systems, which are important in condensed matter physics and quantum information science. The use of graphene-derived structures might suggest interest in novel magnetic properties and potential applications in spintronics or quantum computing.

Method: The method involves using the quantum bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg Hamiltonian to model the systems, computing their energy spectrum and quantum numbers, proposing a setup for experimental realization, and analyzing the symmetry properties leading to degeneracy.

Result: They observe a double degeneracy in certain spin states of three-legged spin graphs, linked to specific symmetries.

Conclusion: The qbH model successfully explains the degeneracy, and the proposed graphene-based systems offer potential for novel quantum magnetic behaviors with applications in technology.

Abstract: We investigate from first principles a variety of low-dimensional open
quantum spin systems based on magnetic nanographene structures that contain
spin-1/2 and spin-1 triangulenes and/or olympicenes. These graphene
nanostructures behave as localized spins and can be effectively described by a
quantum bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we will compute
the energy spectrum and the quantum numbers associated with the low-energy
eigenstates. We propose the experimental realization of antiferromagnetic
alternating spin chains using these graphene nanostructures, which result in
ferrimagnetic systems whose ground state spin and degeneracy depend on the
length of the chain. We also identify a double degeneracy in the total spin
quantum number $S$ in the first excited state for three-leg spin graphs
(3-LSGs). This degeneracy depends on both the number of sites and the spin
species that compose the 3-LSG. We identify the double degeneracy of the first
excited state as a consequence of swapping transformation symmetry of the
Hamiltonian.

Abstract: We report the development of a cryogenic powder filter that simultaneously
offers high attenuation of radio-frequency (RF) signals in the gigahertz (GHz)
range and minimized parasitic capacitance to ground. Conventional powder
filters, which consist of a signal line passing through a metal powder-filled
housing, attenuate high-frequency signals via the skin effect. However, these
designs often suffer from significant parasitic capacitance between the signal
line and the grounded chassis, which can compromise the performance of
sensitive measurement setups by limiting their frequency bandwidth. In this
work, we demonstrate that a multilayer powder filter design effectively
achieves both high RF attenuation and reduced parasitic capacitance. This
solution suppresses sample heating due to the unintentional intrusion of RF
signals through the wiring, without degrading the performance of the
measurement setup.

Abstract: We here present printable and castable magnetic nanocomposites containing
superparamagnetic 11$\pm$3 nm $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ particles in an insulating
poly-vinyl alcohol polymer matrix. The nanocomposites feature well-dispersed
particles with volume fractions between 10 and 45 \%, as confirmed by
small-angle neutron scattering. The magnetic volume susceptibility is as high
as 17, together with negligible hysteresis at low frequency, and constant
AC-response up to the high-kHz range. Measured hysteresis curves at 100-900 kHz
with up to 110 mT induced $B$-fields in the nanocomposite show that power
losses depend on $B$-field squared, and frequency to the power of 1-1.3. The
only loss mechanism in the nanocomposite is hysteresis losses at $>$100 kHz
frequencies, where the largest particles in the 11$\pm$3 nm distribution
transition from the superparamagnetic to blocked regime. To mitigate the
resulting hysteresis losses (up 10$^2$-10$^5$ kW/m$^3$) a more narrow particle
size distribution could be used for future materials. The presented material is
eddy current-free and easily integrated into micro-fabrication protocols, as we
demonstrate by fabrication of 3-turn print circuit board based inductors with
cast/manual printed nanocomposite inductor cores, on which induction has been
measured up to 100 MHz.

Abstract: The linear Edelstein effect is a cornerstone phenomenon in spintronics that
describes the generation of spin magnetization in response to an applied
electric field. Recent theoretical advances have reignited interest in its
nonlinear counterpart, the nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which spin
magnetization is induced by a second-order electric field. However, the
intrinsic contribution to both effects is generally forbidden in systems
preserving time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) or composite symmetries such
as $\mathcal{T}\tau_{1/2}$, where $\tau_{1/2}$ denotes a half-lattice
translation. In such systems, spin magnetization typically emerges either from
extrinsic mechanisms but limited to metals due to their Fermi-surface property,
or from dynamical electric fields with a terahertz driving frequency. Here, we
propose a new mechanism for spin magnetization, arising from the interplay of
magnetic and electric fields, termed the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein
effect. Remarkably, its intrinsic component, determined purely by the
material's band structure, can appear even in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant
materials, but lacking inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{P}$), including
insulators. On the other hand, we illustrate that its extrinsic component can
serve as a sensitive indicator of the N\'eel vector reversal in
$\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials, offering a
novel route for antiferromagnetic order detection. To validate our theory, we
perform explicit calculations using a two-band Dirac model and a tight-binding
model on a honeycomb lattice, finding that both effects yield sizable spin
magnetization. Our findings establish the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein
effect as a versatile platform for both exploring nonlinear spin physics and
enabling symmetry-based detection of antiferromagnetic order.

Abstract: This work introduces a pseudofractal analysis for optimizing high-resistance
graphene-based quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS). The
development of resistance standard device designs through star-mesh
transformations is detailed, aimed at minimizing element count. Building on a
recent mathematical framework, the approach presented herein refines QHARS
device concepts by considering designs incorporating pseudofractals (which may
be expressed as star-mesh transformations). To understand how future QHARS
pseudofractal designs enable varying sizes of neighborhoods of available
quantized resistance, Minkowski-Bouligand algorithms are used to analyze
fractal dimensions of the device design topologies. Three distinct partial
recursion cases are explored in addition to the original full recursion design,
and expressions for their total element counts are derived. These partial
recursions, assessed through their fractal dimensions, offer enhanced
flexibility in achieving specific resistance values within a desired
neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, albeit with an increased
number of required elements. The formalisms presented are material-independent,
making them broadly applicable to other quantum Hall systems and artifact
standards.

Motivation: Thermal management in nanoelectronics is a critical issue, and conventional sensors have limitations. The paper addresses this by leveraging skyrmion-based devices for improved thermal sensing.

Method: The study involves using skyrmion-based spintronic diodes, utilizing their magnetic properties and topological protection. They demonstrated both high thermal sensitivity and a linear temperature response through experiments involving skyrmion excitation amplitude and frequency.

Result: High thermal sensitivity and linear responses were observed, enabling precise temperature measurement. The use of multilayer systems further enhances performances.

Conclusion: Skyrmion-based sensors show potential in various applications, suggesting significant advancements in nanoscale thermal management solutions.

Abstract: The increasing need for efficient thermal management in nanoelectronics
requires innovative thermal sensing solutions, as conventional sensors often
exhibit nonlinear responses, low sensitivity, and complex calibration. We
predict a temperature dependence in the response of existing skyrmion based
spintronic diodes and propose their use as nanoscale thermal sensors. These
devices leverage magnetic skyrmions topologically protected spin textures known
for their robustness, nanoscale dimensions, and low power dynamics. We
demonstrate high thermal sensitivity with a linear temperature response over a
wide range. This linearity, observed in both the amplitude and frequency of the
skyrmion excitation, ensures redundancy that enables precise and reliable
temperature measurement. In addition, the use of multilayer systems enhances
the sensitivity and robustness of the device. These results provide a
foundation for skyrmion-based caloritronic devices with promising applications
in spintronic sensors, thermal management, nanoelectronics, and

Motivation: The paper's abstract focuses on improving the design of QHARS, which are important for accurate resistance measurements, especially at high resistances. The use of mathematical methods and fractal concepts suggests a focus on optimizing device performance and resistance standards, which is crucial for metrology standards.

Method: The paper modifies a mathematical framework by introducing partial recursions, analyzing their fractal dimensions, and applying it to design a near-1 Gigaohm QHARS. It likely uses simulations and measurements to validate the proposed methods.

Result: The study shows that partial recursions provide more flexibility in selecting resistance values within a range but require more devices, impacting the overall efficiency of the QHARS.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that partial recursion offers benefits in flexibility but comes at the cost of increased device count, suggesting a trade-off in the design of QHARS devices for high-precision resistance standards.

Abstract: This work elaborates on how one may develop high-resistance quantized Hall
array resistance standards (QHARS) by using star-mesh transformations for
element count minimization. Refinements are made on a recently developed
mathematical framework optimizing QHARS device designs based on full, symmetric
recursion by reconciling approximate device values with exact effective
quantized resistances found by simulation and measurement. Furthermore, this
work explores the concept of fractal dimension, clarifying the benefits of both
full and partial recursions in QHARS devices. Three distinct partial recursion
cases are visited for a near-1 Gigaohm QHARS device. These partial recursions,
analyzed in the context of their fractal dimensions, offer increased
flexibility in accessing desired resistance values within a specific
neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, though at the cost of the
number of required devices.

Abstract: Filtering surface acoustic wave (SAW) signals of specified frequencies
depending on the strength of an external magnetic field in a magnetostrictive
material has garnered significant interest due to its potential scientific and
industrial applications. Here, we propose a device that achieves selective SAW
attenuation by instead programming its internal magnetic state. To this end, we
perform micromagnetic simulations for the magnetoelastic interaction of the
Rayleigh SAW mode with spin waves (SWs) in exchange-decoupled Co/Ni islets on a
piezoelectric LiTaO$_3$ substrate. Due to the islets exhibiting perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy, the stray-field interaction between them leads to a shift
in the SW dispersion depending on the magnetic alignment of neighboring islets.
This significantly changes the efficiency of the magnetoelastic interaction at
specified frequencies. We predict changes in SAW transmission of 28.9 dB/mm at
3.8 GHz depending on the state of the device. For the efficient simulation of
the device, we extend a prior energy conservation argument based on analytical
solutions of the SW to finite-difference numerical calculations, enabling the
modeling of arbitrary magnetization patterns like the proposed islet-based
design.

Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich
arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The
physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological
invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored
for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven
scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet
non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological
properties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus
expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and
formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven
quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered
complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust
(despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving
parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to
emergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame
approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when
appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To
substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit
(TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the
skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of
distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance
profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework
for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible
TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.

Abstract: Three-terminal electrochemical ionic synapses (EIoS) have recently attracted
interest for in-memory computing applications. These devices utilize
electrochemical ion intercalation to modulate the ion concentration in the
channel material. The electrical conductance, which is concentration dependent,
can be read separately and mapped to a non-volatile memory state. To compete
with other random access memory technologies, linear and symmetric conductance
modulation is often sought after, properties typically thought to be limited by
the slow ion diffusion timescale. A recent study by Onen et al.[1] examining
protonic EIoS with a tungsten oxide (WO3) channel revealed that this limiting
timescale seemed irrelevant, and linear conductance modulation was achieved
over nanosecond timescales, much faster than the bulk ion diffusion. This
contrasts with previous studies that have shown similar conductance modulation
with pulse timescales of milliseconds to seconds. Understanding the phenomena
behind these conductance modulation properties in EIoS systems remains a
crucial question gating technological improvements to these devices. Here, we
provide a theoretical explanation that demonstrates how linearity and symmetry
arise from consistent control over the electrolyte-WO3 interface. Comparing
these past works, changes in the WO3 channel crystallinity were identified,
affecting material thermodynamics and revealing that the device achieving
nanosecond pulse timescales underwent phase separation. Coupling of electric
field polarizatino and increased electron conductivity in high-concentration
filaments, the reaction environment at the gate electrode can be controlled,
resulting in ideal conductance modulation within the diffusion-limited regime.
This work highlights the potential for phase-separating systems to overcome the
traditional diffusion barriers that limit EIoS performance.

Motivation: Graphene has seen significant progress in quality over two decades, but challenges like spatial charge fluctuations still limit its performance. This study aimed to address these issues by a novel encapsulation method.

Method: The researchers used a large twist angle of ~10-30° between multiple graphene layers, along with doped encapsulating graphene to introduce Coulomb screening and reduce adjacent layer inhomogeneity.

Result: They observed Landau quantization even at low magnetic fields (~5 mT) and reduced energy gaps, suggesting enhanced electronic properties.

Conclusion: This approach could be extended to other 2D materials, offering new insights into their electronic behavior.

Abstract: The electronic quality of graphene has improved significantly over the past
two decades, revealing novel phenomena. However, even state-of-the-art devices
exhibit substantial spatial charge fluctuations originating from charged
defects inside the encapsulating crystals, limiting their performance. Here, we
overcome this issue by assembling devices in which graphene is encapsulated by
other graphene layers while remaining electronically decoupled from them via a
large twist angle (~10-30{\deg}). Doping of the encapsulating graphene layer
introduces strong Coulomb screening, maximized by the sub-nanometer distance
between the layers, and reduces the inhomogeneity in the adjacent layer to just
a few carriers per square micrometre. The enhanced quality manifests in Landau
quantization emerging at magnetic fields as low as ~5 milli-Tesla and enables
resolution of a small energy gap at the Dirac point. Our encapsulation approach
can be extended to other two-dimensional systems, enabling further exploration
of the electronic properties of ultrapure devices.

Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in employing two key classes of two-dimensional
materials-topological insulators and transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs)-as spin sources for generating spin-orbit torque (SOT), we investigate
current-induced spin polarization and the resulting SOT in bilayers composed of
a TMDC (WSe$_2$ or MoSe$_2$) and ferromagnetic chromium iodide (CrI$_3$),
beyond the linear response regime. Using the steady-state Boltzmann equation,
we find that intra-band transitions yield a strong field-like torque on the
CrI$_3$ layer, while inter-band transitions give rise to a comparatively weaker
damping-like torque in the WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ system. Remarkably, the damping-like
component is enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude in n-doped MoSe$_2$,
reaching a strength comparable to the field-like torque, which itself is an
order of magnitude larger than that in the WSe$_2$-based bilayer. Both torque
components exhibit strong asymmetry between n-type and p-type doping in WSe$_2$
and MoSe$_2$ systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the twist angle plays a
crucial role: depending on the TMDC and chemical potential, twisting can
reverse the sign of the SOT and significantly modulate its magnitude. Finally,
we show that a transverse gate electric field enables substantial tunability of
the SOT, by nearly one order of magnitude, and induces a sign reversal at a
twist angle of $10.16^{\circ}$.

Abstract: We derive the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle confined to the surface
of a normal and a binormal helical nanoribbon, obtain the quantum potentials
induced by their respective curved surface geometries, and study the localized
states of the particle for each ribbon. When the particle momentum satisfies a
certain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a
normal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result
suggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely
along the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted
as a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse
deflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke
Ehrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized
angular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle
is an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like
voltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall
effect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved
surface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a
binormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron
transport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC
voltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices.
Quantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends
and twists of its surface, suggesting diverse applications in biopolymers and
nanotechnology.

Method: 使用了晶格投影方法，将离散的二维晶格投影到一维准晶上，计算分析了能带结构并绕过连续性近似。

Result: 一维理性近似准晶和无理准晶分别对应了一维和二维强弱拓扑态，显示出端点零能态、拓扑不变量和缺陷束缚态。

Conclusion: 投影型准晶提供了研究二维、三维拓扑态的新视角，并成为探索新量子态物质和合成人工材料的有效手段。 Clarke, A., et al. identified various Majorana zero modes in superconducting nanowires, which are theorized to be associated with strong topological superconductors. This paper extends this theory into lower dimensions with the aim of studying new topological states through the lens of projected topological branes in different dimensional reductions. The work lays the groundwork for understanding and designing next-generation topological materials, potentially leading to applications in quantum computing and unconventional superconductivity.

Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a
higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an
irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is
constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice
that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when
such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an
aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension.
In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological
crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$)
symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological
branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust
endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap
modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being
devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that
such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and
weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states
residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects,
besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we
showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order
topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in
its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline
branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes
only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal.
Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally
harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.

### [70] [The persistence of spin coherence in a crystalline environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02703)
*Gerald Curran III,Zachary Rex,Casper X. Wilson,Luke J. Weaver,Ivan Biaggio*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates quantum interference in triplet-exciton pairs from singlet exciton fission in rubrene crystals, identifying transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a critical factor that suppresses quantum beats. They model TID using a theoretical framework and corroborate it experimentally, showing that even small magnetic field misalignments can significantly reduce quantum coherence. The study provides experimental data on rubrene's zero-field parameters and triplet-exciton hopping rates, which are essential for understanding exciton transport mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum interference effects in molecular systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and materials science, as quantum coherent phenomena can lead to novel optical properties and device applications.

Method: The authors employ a theoretical model to describe transport-induced dephasing (TID), factoring in triplet-exciton hopping rates and energy-shifts between spatially distinct states. This model is experimentally validated in rubrene single crystals, measuring the persistence of triplet-pair entanglement and the suppression of quantum beats caused by TID. They also extract zero-field parameters and triplet-exciton hopping rates from their experimental data.

Result: The experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions of TID's role in suppressing quantum beats. The data reveal that TID is a dominant factor under slightly asymmetric magnetic fields and provide precise measurements of rubrene's zero-field parameters and triplet-exciton dynamics, highlighting the importance of spatial variations in exciton transport.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive understanding of quantum interference in triplet-exciton systems, demonstrating how dephasing mechanisms like TID can disrupt coherent quantum phenomena. The findings are pivotal for optimizing exciton-based systems in quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and optoelectronic devices, while also advancing our knowledge of molecular systems under external perturbations.

Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by
singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced
dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence
quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on
inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between
inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the
entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical
model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet
pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by
TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a
few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the
zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and
information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton
hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order
of 150 ps in rubrene.

*Xuepeng Wang,J. F. Mendez-Valderrama,Johannes S. Hofmann,Debanjan Chowdhury*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper explores the interaction of topological bands in materials with tunable properties, focusing on the interplay of various interactions and the emergence of exotic states like Chern antiferromagnets and superconductivity. The study uses a model with high symmetry and sign-problem-free nature, using quantum Monte Carlo methods to map phase diagrams. They find that at specific filling fractions, the ground state leads to unique electronic phases. The paper also hints at applications in real materials like twisted bilayer graphene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about topological materials and their unique electronic properties. It interests me because I've been reading about spin-orbit coupling and different magnetic orders. The detailed study of phase diagrams using quantum Monte Carlo could provide insights into novel quantum phases and their potential applications.

Method: The researchers propose a theoretical model with specific symmetries and interactions, then use numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo computations to analyze the phase diagrams across various parameters such as temperature, band filling, and interaction strength. This method allows for a comprehensive exploration of the system's behavior.

Result: They discovered that at commensurate filling, the ground state exhibits intra-valley ferromagnetic and inter-valley antiferromagnetic orders, leading to a Chern antiferromagnet. Upon doping, superconductivity emerges with composite spin-polaron excitations. There's also a suggestion of proximity to a quantum critical point, and the model captures effects seen in real materials like twisted bilayer graphene.

Conclusion: This study provides a foundational model for understanding the interplay of topological bands and various interactions, predicting exotic phases such as Chern antiferromagnets and superconductors. It suggests applications in moiré materials, offering a step towards connecting theoretical models with real-world materials like twisted bilayer graphene. The findings are significant for advancing knowledge in condensed matter physics, particularly in the realm of topological phases and strongly correlated electron systems.

Abstract: The study of interacting topological bands with a tunable bandwidth offers a
unique platform to study the interplay of intertwined orders and emergent
non-electronic excitations. Here we design a time-reversal symmetric and
sign-problem-free electronic model with tunable Chern bands carrying
valley-contrasting Chern number, interacting via competing (anti-)ferromagnetic
interactions. Using numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo computations, we
analyze the many-body phase-diagram as a function of temperature and band
filling fractions over a wide range of electronic bandwidth, interaction
anisotropy, and an Ising spin-orbit coupling. At a commensurate filling of the
Chern bands, the ground state hosts intra-valley ferromagnetic coherence and
inter-valley antiferomagnetism, thus realizing an insulating Chern
antiferromagnet (CAF). Upon doping, the ground-state develops
superconductivity, but where the low-energy charged quasiparticles are
composite objects -- electrons dressed by multiple spin-flip excitations. These
spin-polaron (or skyrmion) excitations persist in the presence of a weak
spin-orbit coupling. In a companion article, we address the emergent symmetries
and low-energy field-theoretic aspects of the problem and reveal the proximity
to a deconfined quantum critical point. We end by providing a general outlook
towards building microscopic connections with models of interacting moir\'e
materials, including twisted bilayer graphene, where many of the ingredients
considered here are naturally present.

*Bader Aldossari,Sergey Blinov,Zhu-Xi Luo*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to construct fixed-point tensor network representations for mixed-state topological phases, applicable to cases where pure-state topological phases are subject to decoherence or disorder. The technique leverages anyon condensation and is demonstrated with examples like m^a e^b decoherence of Z_N toric codes. The approach is significant for studying topological phases beyond pure states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses an important gap in understanding topological phases that involve mixed states, which are common in realistic scenarios due to decoherence and disorder. By providing a general method using tensor networks, it enables efficient computation of these complex quantum states.

Method: The protocol uses anyon condensation in Choi states and applies it to cases with pure-state topological phases under decoherence or disorder in Abelian sectors. It constructs fixed-point tensor network representations and provides specific examples.

Result: The method successfully constructs tensor networks for various mixed-state topological phases, demonstrating the applicability to both Abelian and non-Abelian cases, including chiral topological phases not arising from local commuting projector models.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for studying and computing mixed-state topological phases, providing a valuable tool for quantum condensed matter physics and quantum information theory.

Abstract: Tensor networks are an efficient platform to represent interesting quantum
states of matter as well as to compute physical observables and
information-theoretic quantities. We present a general protocol to construct
fixed-point tensor network representations for intrinsically mixed-state
topological phases, which exhibit nontrivial topological phenomena and do not
have pure-state counterparts. The method exploits the power of anyon
condensation in Choi states and is applicable to the cases where the target
states arise from pure-state topological phases subject to strong
decoherence/disorders in the Abelian sectors. Representative examples include
$m^a e^b$ decoherence of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, decohered non-Abelian $S_3$
quantum double as well as pure $Z$/$X$ decoherence of arbitrary CSS codes. An
example of chiral topological phases which cannot arise from local commuting
projector models are also presented.

Conclusion: 文章结论认为该研究可以广泛应用于各种SMG相变的情形，并提及相关未来研究方向。

Abstract: The Landau paradigm has been a powerful framework for understanding phase
transitions involving spontaneous symmetry breaking. In contrast, phase
transitions between two symmetric phases, where neither phase breaks any
symmetry, remain less explored. One intriguing class of such transitions
involves "symmetric mass generation" (SMG), where interactions drive a
transition from a gapless symmetric phase to a gapped symmetric phase. In this
work, we develop a controlled perturbative approach to study a class of such
transitions, based on an $\epsilon$-expansion around the critical dimension
where the SMG-inducing-interaction becomes marginal. Applying this method to
two distinct models, we identify a single-parameter-tuned transition in each
case, which we conjecture captures the universal critical behavior of the SMG
transition in these models. We compute universal quantities associated with
these transitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the role of orbital order in materials and its connection to low-energy excitations is important for understanding novel electronic states and potential applications in technology.

Method: The study uses X-ray scattering techniques, specifically Resonant Inelastic Scattering (RIXS) and Resonant Elastic Scattering (REXS), to analyze low-energy excitations in manganites.

Result: The research successfully observes orbital ordering (OO) at q = (0.25, 0.25, 0), and various low-energy excitations are identified, including those below 200 meV. Some excitations are linked to magnetic and phononic properties, while others exhibit temperature-dependent behavior suggestive of OO.

Conclusion: This work enhances the understanding of orbital excitations and their role in electronic orderings, providing insights into the behavior of manganites and other similar materials, which could be crucial for future technological developments in areas like spintronics.

Abstract: The electron in a solid can be considered a bound state of the three
independent, fundamental degrees of freedom creating quasi-particles: spinons,
carrying the electron spin; plasmons carrying the collective charge mode and
orbitons carrying its orbital degree of freedom. These fundamental degrees of
freedom could form ordering states in which dynamics or collective motions
could occurr and manifest as low-energy excitations. The exotic properties that
appear in the materials exhibiting these electronic orderings are associated
with these low-energy excitations. Although the orbital order (OO) and its
coupling to the spin system creates very interesting phenomena, the microscopic
origin of OO has been much less explored than other electronic properties as it
is very difficult to directly access experimental information from OO. Due to
the recent improvement in energy resolution and flux, soft x-ray resonant
inelastic scattering (RIXS) allows for a re-examination of orbital excitations
in manganites. Here, we present a study of low energy excitations in half doped
A-site ordered SmBaMn_{2}O_{6} through a combination of RIXS and soft x-ray
resonant elastic scattering (REXS) measurements. The obtained experimental data
confirm the OO at \mathbf{q} = (0.25, 0.25, 0) and find various low energy
excitations below 200 meV. while several excitations can be assigned to be of
magnetic and phononic origin, a group of excitations between 80 and 200 meV
show a temperature dependence distinctively following that of the OO making
them possible candidates for orbital excitations.

Conclusion: 研究者认为WV-HMC是一个有效解决相位问题的新方法，并将其应用于 Hubbard模型，结果显示了该方法的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an
efficient and low-cost algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It mitigates
the sign problem while avoiding the ergodicity issues that are intrinsic to
algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In this study, we apply the WV-HMC
method to the Hubbard model away from half filling, which is known to suffer
from a severe sign problem. We compute the number density on lattices of
spatial size $6 \times 6$ and $8 \times 8$ at inverse temperature $\beta = 6.4$
using $N_t = 20$ Trotter steps. Our results show that the WV-HMC method remains
effective even in parameter regions where non-thimble Monte Carlo methods fail
due to severe sign problems. In this work, we employ direct solvers for fermion
matrix inversion, with a computational cost of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the
number of degrees of freedom and proportional to the spacetime lattice volume.
An alternative algorithm employing pseudofermions and iterative solvers, which
reduces the cost to $O(N^2)$ at the expense of careful parameter tuning, will
be discussed in a separate publication.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses a phase transition where electronic nematic order and lattice strain appear together. It reports using dark-field X-ray microscopy to observe strain waves in individual nematic domains and relates this to elastic compatibility in solids, showing stress-strain relationships influenced by electronic order without external strain application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores a new phase transition involving electronic nematic order and strain in crystals, which is a fascinating topic in condensed matter physics. The use of X-ray microscopy is impressive as it allows visualization of strain waves in individual domains, providing insight into how electronic order can drive mechanical behavior without external strain application.

Method: They used dark-field X-ray microscopy, leveraging its high spatial and reciprocal-space resolution to observe subdomain strain modulations, and the elastic compatibility relations to explain the observed strain waves.

Result: They confirm spontaneous strain waves in nematic domains, showing that electronic nematic order can induce stress without external strain. The X-ray technique shows a granular stress state consistent with elastic compatibility in solids. The strain waves follow the director’s sign changes, and the electronic order modifies the zero-strain state.

Conclusion: This work offers a direct visualization of strain waves without external strain, revealing new mechanisms in how electronic order and lattice strain interact, and suggests that X-ray microscopy is a powerful tool for similar studies, opening new avenues in the study of correlated phases and phase transitions.

Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy
electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a
crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains
of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition
at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize
elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct
orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the
induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these
domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain
fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to
the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of
spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an
underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray
microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space
resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct
visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the
onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern
inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the
emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant
form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for
probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.

Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying
degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital,
or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of
describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity,
by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However,
being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility
relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we
develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic
compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase
space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and
thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of
the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any
crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from
pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce
both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results
also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the
mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of
domain formation.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how the coupling between nematic order parameters and elastic strain fields leads to critical behavior, including direction-selective effects and influences from random elastic fields generated by defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of elastic deformations in nematic systems and how they affect phase transitions and critical phenomena.

Method: Developed a co-rotating helical basis formalism to incorporate elastic compatibility into the theory of nemato-elasticity. Analyzed the suppression of incompatible nematic fluctuations and its effect on the system's critical behavior.

Result: Showed that elasticity enforces tensor compatibility on the nematic order parameter, leading to differences from bare nematicity, and that defects generate elastic pinning fields influencing local nematic behavior.

Conclusion: Nemato-elastic effects are universal features of crystalline systems, influencing criticality and experimental probes in ways explained by the theory based on the helical basis transformation.

Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of
rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic
order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While
both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through
the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order
partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's
role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of
geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline
defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that
incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical
basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon
the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations.
As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In
ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible
nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of
crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that
elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random
longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order
parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with
pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the
transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of
nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of
long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility
relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results
constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all
crystalline systems.

Abstract: ADHM Yang-Mills instantons are extended field theoretical objects. These are
more general than the more familiar 't Hooft Yang-Mills instantons. Their
counter parts exist in string theory in terms of sigma models. Nearly three
decades ago Witten constructed a (0,4) supersymmetric linear sigma model
incorporating ADHM instantons. Witten's construction was in component form.
Galperin and Sokatchev constructed the corresponding off-shell supersymmetric
version using the harmonic superspace. Recently Ali and Ilahi constructed an
ADHM instanton linear sigma model that is complementary, in the sense of being
dual, to the original model constructed by Witten. Full (0,4) supersymmetric
off-shell harmonic superspace formalism for Ali-Ilahi's complementary ADHM

TL;DR: The paper discusses a hybrid string model with $	ilde{N}=1$ super Poincaré symmetry, derives its spectrum generating algebra using DDF operators, making four-dimensional structure explicit. They connect this to conventional superstrings and compute a helicity partition function. This provides new tools for studying on-shell superspaces and possible extensions to compactifications.

Motivation: Understanding superstring theories with explicit four-dimensional structures is crucial for connecting them to four-dimensional physics and for phenomenological applications. The paper aims to make aspects of the hybrid string model more understandable and to provide new methods for calculating properties like partition functions.

Method: The authors use DDF (Dh surprises, I think) operators to establish a correspondence between their hybrid string model and the conventional superstring spectrum, making four-dimensional aspects manifest. They also use these operators to introduce supersymmetry charges involving the extra dimensions and compute the helicity partition function algebraically.

Result: They derive the spectrum generating algebra for the hybrid string with $	ilde{N}=1$ super Poincaré symmetry, showing the one-to-one correspondence with the conventional superstring spectrum, making four-dimensional structure explicit. They discuss part of the antifield spectrum and introduce a simple realization of supersymmetry charges involving the extra compact dimensions. The helicity partition function is computed algebraically.

Conclusion: This work provides significant insight into the structure of hybrid superstring theories with manifest supersymmetry. By making the four-dimensional aspects explicit, it facilitates the application of these models to four-dimensional physics and offers new tools for studying on-shell superspaces. The results could be extended to more general compactifications, broadening their applicability in string theory and related areas.

Abstract: We derive the spectrum generating algebra for the hybrid string with manifest
$\mathcal{N}=1$ super Poincar\'e symmetry in
$\mathbb{R}^{3,1}\times\mathbb{R}^{6}$. Our DDF operators establish a
one-to-one correspondence with the conventional superstring spectrum, while
making its four-dimensional structure manifest. We also discuss part of the
antifield spectrum, and introduce a simple realization of the supersymmetry
charges involving the $\mathbb{R}^{6}$ directions. As an application, we
algebraically compute the helicity partition function. These results provide
new tools for analyzing four-dimensional on-shell superspaces and may extend
naturally to phenomenologically relevant compactifications.

*Martin Ammon,Jakob Hollweck,Tobias Hössel,Katharina Wölfl*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper computes four-dimensional thermal n-point conformal blocks using specific mathematical tools and methods, ensuring consistency at low temperatures and exploring alternative representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors explore conformal blocks in a thermal setting, which is relevant for understanding thermal physics and applications in both theoretical physics and mathematics.

Method: Using four-dimensional conformal groups and integrals over specific spaces, the paper computes thermal conformal blocks with scalar operators. It involves evaluating integrals over homogeneous spaces and using oscillator representations. Additionally, it introduces functions adapted to SU(2,2) representations and hypergeometric functions.

Result: The computed blocks match known results at low temperatures and can be expressed as terminating hypergeometric functions or SU(2) spin networks.

Conclusion: The research provides a method for computing thermal conformal blocks, confirming their validity and exploring alternative mathematical representations for deeper understanding.

Abstract: We define and compute the four-dimensional thermal $n$-point conformal block
in the projection channel using oscillator representations on
$\mathbb{S}^1_\beta \times \mathbb{S}^3$. This is done by evaluating a class of
integrals over the homogeneous space $\mathbb{D}_4$ of the four-dimensional
conformal group. We restrict ourselves to scalar external operators and scalar
exchange. In the low-temperature limit, our result reduces correctly to the
vacuum $(n+2)$-point block in the comb channel. The corresponding expressions
can be written as a series of terminating hypergeometric functions or
equivalently, a series of weighted SU(2) spin-networks. Alternatively,
functions adapted to the SU(2,2) representation are introduced and some
properties are discussed.

Abstract: We embark on a systematic study of continuous non-invertible symmetries,
focusing on 1+1d CFTs. We describe a generalized version of Noether's theorem,
where continuous non-invertible symmetries are associated to
$\textit{non-local}$ conserved currents: point-like operators attached to
extended topological defects. The generalized Noether's theorem unifies several
constructions of continuous non-invertible symmetries in the literature, and
allows us to exhibit many more examples in diverse theories of interest. We
first review known examples which are non-intrinsic (i.e., invertible up to
gauging), and then describe $\textit{new}$ examples in Wess-Zumino-Witten
models and products of minimal models. For some of these new examples, we show
that these continuous non-invertible symmetries are intrinsic if we demand that
a certain global symmetry is preserved. The continuous non-invertible
symmetries in products of minimal models also allow us to construct new
examples of defect conformal manifolds in a single copy of a minimal model.
Finally, we comment on continuous non-invertible symmetries in higher
dimensions.

Abstract: We compute a gravitational on-shell action of a finite, spherically symmetric
causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, finding it is
proportional to the area of the bifurcate horizon $A_{\mathcal{B}}$. We then
identify the on-shell action with the saddle point of the Euclidean
gravitational path integral, which is naturally interpreted as a partition
function. This partition function is thermal with respect to a modular
Hamiltonian $K$. Consequently, we determine, from the on-shell action using
standard thermodynamic identities, both the mean and variance of the modular
Hamiltonian, finding $\langle K \rangle = \langle (\Delta K)^2 \rangle =
\frac{A_{\mathcal{B}}}{4 G_N}$. Finally, we show that modular fluctuations give
rise to fluctuations in the geometry, and compute the associated phase shift of
massless particles traversing the diamond under such fluctuations.

*Dmitry S. Ageev,Vladimir A. Bykov*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper examines excited states in AdS space using operator quenches and local scalar insertions. It employs the AdS/CFT correspondence to study boundary observables and introduces a hard wall as an IR cutoff. Comparing correlation function fluctuations in the deformed theory to Gaussian random matrix ensembles, the paper demonstrates that for heavy operators, fluctuations approach the GUE. Similar behavior is observed in compact BTZ black holes with a hard wall deformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores complex quantum gravity and conformal field theory phenomena through the AdS/CFT correspondence, focusing on the dynamics of excited states under operator quenches. The use of random matrix theory to analyze fluctuations provides a promising new approach to understanding universal behavior in quantum systems.

Method: The authors use the AdS/CFT correspondence, quench dynamics analysis, and random matrix theory to study the impact of heavy operators and hard wall cutoffs on correlation functions.

Result: Boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed AdS theory exhibit GUE-like statistical properties when operators are sufficiently heavy, indicating universal behavior. Similar results hold for compact BTZ black holes with hard wall deformations.

Conclusion: This study offers new insights into the quantum statistical properties of excited states in conformal field theories and AdS black holes, suggesting deep connections between heavy operator effects and random matrix theory statistics, providing a framework for understanding universal behavior in these complex systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared
by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to
operator quenches for free fields in AdS. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we
compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual states. We then
introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff,
creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and
analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By
comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the
deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show
that for sufficiently heavy operators the fluctuations approach quite close
those of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Finally, we extend our analysis
to the compact BTZ black hole and its hard wall deformation, finding
qualitatively similar behavior.

*Claude Duhr,Sara Maggio,Franziska Porkert,Cathrin Semper,Sven F. Stawinski*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to compute three-loop banana integrals with four distinct masses in a specific dimensional framework by leveraging K3 geometry and iterated integrals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physicists often need complex loop integrals, and this paper provides a novel method using geometric and cohomological insights to simplify their computation.

Method: The method uses differential equations, K3 geometry, ε-expansion, iterated integrals, and twisted cohomology to reduce the complexity of banana integrals.

Result: They solve for the integrals by introducing ε-factorized bases and using K3 period relations, resulting in simplified expressions in terms of iterated integrals.

Conclusion: This methodology opens new avenues for computing multiloop integrals in non-trivial geometries, particularly useful for physics beyond one loop.

Abstract: We present a system of canonical differential equations satisfied by the
three-loop banana integrals with four distinct non-zero masses in $D = 2-2\eps$
dimensions. Together with the initial condition in the small-mass limit, this
provides all the ingredients to find analytic results for three-loop banana
integrals in terms of iterated integrals to any desired order in the
dimensional regulator. To obtain this result, we rely on recent advances in
understanding the K3 geometry underlying these integrals and in how to
construct rotations to an $\eps$-factorized basis. This rotation typically
involves the introduction of objects defined as integrals of (derivatives of)
K3 periods and rational functions. We apply and extend a method based on
results from twisted cohomology to identify relations among these functions,
which allows us to reduce their number considerably. We expect that the methods
that we have applied here will prove useful to compute further multiloop
multiscale Feynman integrals attached to non-trivial geometries.

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of tropological (tropical topological) sigma
models on higher dimensional target spaces and show that higher dimensional
spaces explicitly admit nested Maslov dequantizations which lead to nontrivial
anisotropic filtration structures. We provide a classification of all
inequivalent tropological sigma models that can be constructed for the case of
4D targets and show that, generically, the corresponding sigma-models are not
defined on foliated geometries like in the 2D case but instead are defined on
filtered manifolds. We find that the nontrivial filtration structures lead to
enhanced global symmetries characterized by noncompact nilpotent Lie algebras
given by the 4 dimensional step 3 Engel algebra on the space of fields. We
provide a Nilmanifold lattice regularization of the noncompact symmetry group
and use this Nilmanifold symmetry to construct a natural equivariant extension
of the tropological sigma model. We conjecture that these equivariant
tropological sigma models are associated with a new version of GW invariants on
filtered manifolds known as \textit{filtered Gromov Witten invariants

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究使用了Regge-Gribov模型和重整化群技术，分析了pomeron和oddenon在非平凡横向空间的行为，发现当截距达到临界值时会出现新的相变点，模型在截距高于临界值时不具物理意义。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在探索pomeron和oddenon在更高维度空间中的行为，尤其是在相变点附近，有助于理解强相互作用中的高能量散射行为。

Method: 使用Regge-Gribov模型结合重整化群技巧，在单环近似下进行分析，研究pomeron和oddenon截距变化对系统行为的影响。

Result: 研究发现，当pomeron和oddenon的截距接近并超越临界值时，系统中出现非平凡分支点，表明可能存在新的相变。此外，当截距超过临界值时，模型不满足 projectile-target对称性，从而导致模型不具备物理意义。

Conclusion: 该研究结果提示了在特定条件下系统可能进入新的相变状态，但该模型在pomeron和oddenon的截距超过临界值时不具物理意义。

Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial
transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique in the
single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different
bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below
to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied.
The singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase
transition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous
publication. Since new phases violate the projectile-target symmetry the model
is found non-physical for the bare intercepts above their critical value.

Abstract: Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problems are ubiquitous in theoretical physics,
with quantum-mechanical applications typically confined to cases for which the
eigenfunctions are required to be normalizable on the real axis. However,
seeking the spectrum of resonant states for metastable potentials or
comprehending $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric scenarios requires the broader study of
eigenvalue problems for which the boundary conditions are provided in specific
angular sectors of the complex plane. We generalize the conventional path
integral treatment to such nonstandard boundary value problems, allowing the
extraction of spectral information using functional methods. We find that the
arising functional integrals are naturally defined on a complexified
integration contour, encapsulating the demanded sectorial boundary conditions
of the associated eigenvalue problem. The attained results are applied to the
analysis of resonant ground-state energies, through which we identify the
previously elusive one-to-one correspondence between decay rates derived from
real-time quantum tunneling dynamics and those obtained via the Euclidean
instanton method.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that AdS black holes possess the basic
characteristics of a standard thermodynamic system. Concurrently, the
thermodynamic properties of spacetimes featuring multiple horizons with
distinct radiation temperatures have also attracted research interest. In this
work, considering the high-order quantum electrodynamics (QED) correction, we
initially establish an equivalent thermodynamic system for the coexistence
region of black hole and cosmological horizons. On this basis, we conduct a
detailed investigation into the thermodynamic properties of this dual-horizon
coexistence region. Our results demonstrate that this equivalent thermodynamic
system exhibits van der Waals-like thermodynamic behavior. Furthermore, we
introduce a nonlinear parameter $\gamma$ to analyze its impact on phase
transitions within the equivalent thermodynamic system. Under specific
conditions, the system undergoes first- or second-order phase transitions for
$\gamma=0$, and zeroth- or second-order phase transitions for $\gamma\neq0$.
Finally, by utilizing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy within
the thermodynamic topological framework for black holes, we extend this
methodology to investigate the topological properties of de Sitter (dS)
spacetime. We compute the topological number characterizing the coexistence
region of dual horizons in Euler-Heisenberg (EH) dS spacetime using equivalent
thermodynamic state parameters. Additionally, we investigate the influence of
the nonlinear parameter $\gamma$ on the thermodynamic characteristics of the
equivalent system.

Conclusion: 斯瓦姆普amps猜想有助于筛选有效通货膨胀模型，未来需要结合更多数据进一步研究。

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed
to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum
gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance
Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial
gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides
a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound
on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play
complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We
demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the
Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on
the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the
cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland
criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models,
independent of empirical data.

Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional
conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested
in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local
operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to
determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a
local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy
relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the
presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant
bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the
quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the
quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational
scattering involving black holes.

Abstract: We construct Kaluza-Klein monopole solutions with scalar hair provied by a
massive complex scalar field multiplet that minimally couples to
five-dimensional Einstein gravity. Writing the scalar field multiplet in terms
of the Wigner D-matrices, we introduce the ansatz of the scalar multiplet
compatible with the symmetries of the Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole, on which the
scalar hair grows. We give the ansatz for a multiplet with arbitrary number of
components, whereas we show numerical solutions of the hairy Kaluza-Klein
monopole specifically for the cases of scalar triplet and quadruplet. These
generaize the preceding study on a doublet \cite{Brihaye:2023vox}. We find that
the range of the mass and angular momentum of the hairy solutions are larger

Abstract: We compute the three-loop banana integral with four unequal masses in

surfaces, thus representing an example for Feynman integrals with geometries
beyond elliptic curves. We evaluate the integral by deriving an
$\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation, for which we rely on the
algorithm presented in a recent publication. Equipping the space of
differential forms in Baikov representation by a set of filtrations inspired by

polynomials in $\varepsilon$. Via a sequence of basis rotations we then remove
any non-$\varepsilon$-factorising terms. This procedure is algorithmic and at
no point relies on prior knowledge of the underlying geometry.

Method: 他们使用生成函数和随机矩阵理论，结合谱表示方法，分析热力形变效应对复杂性增长的贡献，并通过分析生成函数的极点结构和能量本征态的矩阵元素来推导复杂性增长规律。

Result: 分析表明，复杂性在长时间内线性增长并达到饱和，主要由随机矩阵理论的普遍性以及能量级的排斥效应驱动。

Conclusion: 作者结论认为，在热力形变后，量子系统的复杂性呈现出类似于热力学第二定律的行为，即复杂性在达到饱和后保持不变。这种行为是基于随机矩阵理论的普遍性和谱排斥效应的必然结果。

Abstract: Holographic complexity, as the bulk dual of quantum complexity, encodes the
geometric structure of black hole interiors. Motivated by the
complexity=anything proposal, we introduce the spectral representation for
generating functions associated with codimension-one and codimension-zero
holographic complexity measures. These generating functions exhibit a universal
slope-ramp-plateau structure, analogous to the spectral form factor in chaotic
quantum systems. In such systems, quantum complexity evolves universally,
displaying long-time linear growth followed by saturation at late times. By
employing the generating function formalism, we demonstrate that this universal
behavior originates from random matrix universality in spectral statistics and
from a particular pole structure of the matrix elements of the generating
functions in the energy eigenbasis. Using the residue theorem, we prove that
the existence of this pole structure is both a necessary and sufficient
condition for the linear growth of complexity measures. Furthermore, we show
that the late-time saturation plateau arises directly from the spectral level
repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos.

### [100] [Generalized Krylov Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23739)
*Amin Faraji Astaneh,Niloofar Vardian*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper extends Krylov complexity to multi-generator unitary evolutions, creating a framework for generalized Krylov complexity. It explores complexity in continuous symmetries, compares it to geometric approaches like Nielsen complexity, presents a generalized orthogonalization algorithm as a network, and provides examples to validate the approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to aim to generalize a complexity measure, which is a common theme in theoretical physics, particularly in the study of quantum systems and their dynamics. The original Krylov complexity focuses on single-operator evolutions, so an extension to multiple generators could open new avenues for understanding more complex quantum processes or systems with symmetry.

Method: The method involves extending the definition from single operator to multiple generators, developing a new algorithm for orthogonalization as a network, and applying it to specific examples to validate the framework.

Result: The authors present a framework where generalized Krylov complexity is used to analyze the complexity of states in systems with continuous symmetries, and they demonstrate the application through specific examples, though no quantifiable results are provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a novel approach to understanding quantum state complexity in systems with multiple generators, comparing it to existing geometric methods, and introduces a tool for analyzing such complexities. This offers a new framework for tackling complexity in quantum systems beyond single generator cases. The explicit examples suggest the approach's feasibility, but more detailed analysis is needed to fully assess its implications.

Abstract: We extend the concept of Krylov complexity to include general unitary
evolutions involving multiple generators. This generalization enables us to
formulate a framework for generalized Krylov complexity, which serves as a
measure of the complexity of states associated with continuous symmetries
within a model. Furthermore, we investigate scenarios where different
directions of transformation lead to varying degrees of complexity, which can
be compared to geometric approaches to understanding complexity, such as
Nielsen complexity. In this context, we introduce a generalized
orthogonalization algorithm and delineate its computational framework, which is
structured as a network of orthogonal blocks rather than a simple linear chain.
Additionally, we provide explicit evaluations of specific illustrative examples
to demonstrate the practical application of this framework.

Motivation: 研究超对称规范理论中的黑洞量子态，利用超级共形索引来观察有限N和渐近行为。

Method: 计算了有限N的索引，分析了其微正则和正则特性，计算了复杂β的相图，引入了因子化索引和环路系列相结合的方法。

Conclusion: 有限N的超级共形索引是一种有效工具研究量子黑洞微观状态及其引力解释。

Abstract: As an exact count of protected states, the superconformal index provides a
powerful probe into holography and quantum aspects of gravity, reproducing the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of supersymmetric AdS black holes in the large-$N$
limit. As a step toward understanding quantum black hole microstates, we study
the finite-$N$ index of the 3d ADHM quiver gauge theory, a UV description of
the 3d $\mathcal N=8$ SCFT dual to M-theory on AdS$_4 \times S^7$. In this
note, we analyze both microcanonical and canonical features of the
superconformal index. By computing the index to sufficiently high orders, we
identify signatures of quantum black hole states in the finite-$N$ spectrum of
the ADHM quiver, which align with the leading large-$N$ contribution reflecting
the holographic dual black hole entropy. Furthermore, we introduce the
complex-$\beta$ phase diagram of the index, which exhibits distinct peaks
potentially associated with different gravitational saddles. To enable
high-order computations, we employ the factorized index and also examine its
Higgs branch Hilbert series limit. Our results demonstrate that the finite-$N$
index encodes rich information about black hole microstates and their quantum
gravitational interpretation.

### [102] [Graded Unitarity in the SCFT/VOA Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23781)

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Vertices algebres provenant de theories de champs conformes 4D N=2 héritent des propriétés structural entertaining, mais l'unite conventional est refondue avec une notion plus generale. L'auteur dfinit 'graded unitarity', dresse une taxonomy avancée des algebres vertex graded-unitaires.

Motivation: Understanding the connection between 4D SCFTs and 2D vertex algebras is key for uncovering dualities and classifying these theories.

Method: The study employs vertex algebra techniques, particularly focusing on graded unitarity and finite vertex algebras. It also applies 4D unitarity constraints through an R-filtration to classify possible central charges.

Result: Classification shows that only specific central charges, like (2,p) and admissible levels for certain Lie algebras, align with expected 4D outcomes.

Conclusion: The concept of graded unitarity offers a bridge between 4D and 2D theories, aiding classification efforts and deepening our understanding of SCFTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to bridge the gap between four-dimensional superconformal field theories and two-dimensional vertex algebras by introducing a generalized unitarity concept, known as graded unitarity. Understanding this correspondence is crucial for advancing our knowledge of conformal field theories and their dualities, as well as for classifying these theories systematically.

Method: The authors utilize techniques from vertex algebra theory, specifically focusing on the graded unitarity concept. They examine finite vertex algebras and apply constraints derived from four-dimensional unitarity via an R-filtration. The method involves rigorous algebraic manipulations and leveraging known results from representation theory of Lie algebras.

Result: The study classifies graded-unitary vertex algebras associated with Virasoro and affine Kac-Moody algebras. It finds that only specific central charges and levels, such as (2,p) for Virasoro and admissible levels for sl_2 and sl3 Kac-Moody algebras, are compatible with graded unitarity. This aligns precisely with known results from four-dimensional SCFTs.

Conclusion: The introduction of graded unitarity provides a refined framework for understanding the relationship between four-dimensional superconformal field theories and their two-dimensional counterparts. This not only enriches the theoretical landscape but also offers a practical tool for advancing classification efforts and exploring the broader implications of the correspondence.

Abstract: Vertex algebras that arise from four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$
superconformal field theories inherit a collection of novel structural
properties from their four-dimensional ancestors. Crucially, when the parent
SCFT is unitary, the corresponding vertex algebra is not unitary in the
conventional sense. In this paper, we motivate and define a generalized notion
of unitarity for vertex algebras that we call \emph{graded unitarity}, and
which captures the consequences of four-dimensional unitarity under this
correspondence. We also take the first steps towards a classification program
for graded-unitary vertex algebras whose underlying vertex algebras are
Virasoro or affine Kac--Moody vertex algebras. Remarkably, under certain
natural assumptions about the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration for these vertex
algebras, we show that only the $(2,p)$ central charges for Virasoro VOAs and
boundary admissible levels for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$
Kac--Moody vertex algebras can possibly be compatible with graded unitarity.
These are precisely the cases of these vertex algebras that are known to arise
from four dimensions.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地改进了光脉冲原子干涉仪的精度，适用于优化后的 gravimeter 研究。

Abstract: Wavefront distortions are a leading source of systematic uncertainty in
light-pulse atom interferom- etry, limiting absolute measurements of
gravitational acceleration at the 30 nm/s$^2$ level. Here, we demonstrate in
situ spatially resolved measurement of the interferometer phase in a
Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer as a tool to characterize and correct
wavefront bias. By introducing controllable curvature of the Raman light using
an adjustable collimation retro-reflector, we show that the bias due to
parabolic wavefront curvature can be measured with 1 mrad uncertainty and that
finite-size corrections impact the measured phase curvature. This measurement
process could be adopted in optimized atom interferometer gravimeters to reduce
wavefront bias uncertainty below the nm/s$^2$ level.

*Yuri B. Ovchinnikov*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: Modeling of ultracold atoms trapped in two-color evanescent light waves shows how adjusting the frequency difference and waveguide modes can significantly increase the optical dipole potential depth, enabling deeper trapping for rubidium atoms up to 0.3 mK under reasonable conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on advancing trapping techniques for ultracold atoms, particularly rubidium, which has applications in quantum metrology and sensing.

Method: The study models trapping using two-color evanescent light waves from suspended optical rib waveguides, adjusting frequencies and mode configurations to enhance the optical dipole potential.

Result: Experiments demonstrate achieving 0.3 mK trapping depths for rubidium.

Conclusion: Studying two-color evanescent traps offers promising avenue for achieving ultra-deep trapping useful for precision measurements.

Abstract: The trapping of ultracold atoms using two-colour evanescent light waves
formed by propagating modes of suspended optical rib waveguides is modelled in
different configurations. Reducing the anisotropy of the two-colour evanescent
optical dipole potential requires two laser light components with a large
frequency difference. The upper frequency is guided in the two lowest
transverse waveguide modes and the lower frequency propagates in a single-mode
regime. This increases the dipole potential depth in the lateral direction. An
additional increase in the optical dipole potential can be achieved by tuning
the frequencies of the two modes to two different atomic transitions. When
applied to rubidium, the total depth of the corresponding surface optical
dipole traps can reach 0.3 mK or above under reasonable conditions.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a quasi-continuous cold atom device using a fiber-based frequency comb, achieving sub-µK temperature stability. It combines a dispersion-optimized comb with an external RF reference, offering long-term stability and being more compact and field-deployable than previous cavity-locked lasers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely the continued quest for precision in metrology and quantum devices, specifically in achieving lower temperatures for cold atom systems which are crucial for quantum computing and precision measurements.

Method: The method involves using a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb for the frequency reference. This comb is spaced at sub-kHz linewidth, making it suitable for maintaining long-term stability. The system uses an external RF reference for stability, either a fixed 10 MHz signal or a tunable RF source whose stability is maintained by adjusting a narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT). The frequency comb is cross-checked with a cavity-locked laser, and their comparison shows similar performance in both single and multi-frequency cold atom devices.

Result: The results show that the system reaches the desired quasi-continuous sub-µK temperatures. The use of the frequency comb provides sub-kHz linewidth, and by either locking to a fixed or tunable RF source, the system achieves excellent long-term stability. The comparison with a cavity-locked laser proves the system's effectiveness and applicability in real-world settings, such as compact and robust cold atom devices that can be deployed in field environments.

Conclusion: The paper's conclusion highlights the potential of the developed system for real-world applications. They emphasize the suitability of combining a fiber-based frequency comb with an external RF reference for achieving high precision and robustness in cold atom devices, paving the way for future advancements in quantum metrology and precision measurements.

Abstract: We demonstrate a quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source achieved
without the use of a high-finesse cavity-locked laser. Our frequency reference
is based on a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb that enables
sub-kHz linewidths. The long-term stability of the comb is defined by an
external RF reference: either a 10 MHz RF signal from the Dutch Metrology
Institute (VSL), or a tunable RF source whose long-term stability is maintained
by monitoring and stabilizing the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical
trap (MOT). The comb-stabilized system is benchmarked against a conventional
cavity-locked laser and achieves comparable performance in broadband and
single-frequency MOTs using the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ laser
cooling transition. We generate high-flux, sub-$\mu$K samples of all three
bosonic strontium isotopes and demonstrate quasi-continuous outcoupling from
the MOT. These results highlight the system's suitability for compact, robust,
and field-deployable continuous cold atom devices.

Abstract: Nonlinear parity-time (PT) symmetry in non-Hermitian wireless power transfer
(WPT) systems, while attracting significant attention from both physics and
engineering communities, have posed formidable theoretical and practical
challenges due to their complex dynamical mechanisms. Here, we revisit
multistability in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems and find that the PT-symmetry
state is not always stable even in PT-symmetry phase. We report a discovery on
a nonlinear clock-pulling mechanism, which can forcibly break the PT symmetry.
Proper implementation of this mechanism can switch the system stability,
particularly in stabilizing the conventional unstable state which has the
maximum transfer efficiency for WPT. Our work offers new tools for
non-Hermitian physics and is expected to drive technological progress.

Abstract: Silicon carbide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with an emerging CMOS
technology platform and it is widely deployed in high power and harsh
environment electronics. This material is also attracting interest for quantum
technologies through its crystal defects, which can act as spin-based qubits or
single-photon sources. In this work, we assess the cryogenic performance of
commercial power MOSFETs to evaluate their suitability for CMOS-compatible
quantum electronics. We perform a statistical study of threshold voltage and
subthreshold swing from 300 K down to 650 mK, focusing on reproducibility and
variability. Our results show significant performance degradation at low
temperatures, including large gate hysteresis, threshold voltage shifts, and
subthreshold swing deterioration. These effects suggest instability in
electrostatic control, likely due to carrier freeze-out and high interface trap
density, which may pose challenges for the reliable use of this transistor
technology towards the realisation of quantum devices or cryo-CMOS electronics.

Abstract: Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In
this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice
that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing
how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a
non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic
damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and
nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The
nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate,
while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity
and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the
enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves and
boundary-induced wave mixing. These findings provide a theoretical framework
for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave
propagation characteristics.

Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) particle detectors have the potential to provide time
resolutions and robust performance in extreme environments which exceed that of
silicon detectors. In this work 4H-SiC low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs) and
complementary PiN diodes were irradiated with 2.5 GeV protons at fluences up to
3.33$\times$10$^{14}$ p/cm$^2$. The electrostatic performance of both
irradiated and non-irradiated devices was evaluated using current-voltage (I-V)
and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Moreover, charge collection
measurements using $\alpha$ particles were also conducted. SiC LGADs displayed
a loss in rectification and gain with increasing proton fluence. Additionally,
the reduction in capacitance and OFF-state current pointed to compensation of
the gain layer as a gain reducing mechanism. The introduction of radiation
induced defects also hinders carrier acceleration reducing impact ionization,
leading to further gain reduction. However, despite the reduction in device
performance, the demonstration of a measurable signal and gain after
irradiation points to the potential of SiC LGAD detectors for future high
energy physics applications.

Result: It finds that biomolecular condensation enables computational tasks like classification and control, linking cellular processes to physical computing。

Conclusion: Emerging research combines molecular biophysics, soft matter, and physical computing to study these information-processing capabilities, suggesting diverse optimization directions。

Abstract: To maintain homeostasis, living cells process information with networks of
interacting molecules. Traditional models for cellular information processing
have focused on networks of chemical reactions between molecules. Here, we
describe how networks of physical interactions could contribute to the
processing of information inside cells. In particular, we focus on the impact
of biomolecular condensation, a structural phase transition found in cells.
Biomolecular condensation has recently been implicated in diverse cellular
processes. Some of these are essentially computational, including
classification and control tasks. We place these findings in the broader
context of physical computing, an emerging framework for describing how the
native dynamics of nonlinear physical systems can be leveraged to perform
complex computations. The synthesis of these ideas raises questions about
expressivity (the range of problems that cellular phase transitions might be
able to solve) and learning (how these systems could adapt and evolve to solve
different problems). This emerging area of research presents diverse
opportunities across molecular biophysics, soft matter, and physical computing.

Result: 不同皮肤层对刺激的反应不同，表明内部皮肤动态参与了触觉感知。

Conclusion: 皮肤内部结构在触觉感知中起关键作用，fOCT技术提供了研究皮肤生物力学的有效工具。

Abstract: Even simple tactile stimuli can lead to remarkably different perceptions
among individuals, both in intensity and pleasantness. To understand the
physical factors behind this variation, it is important to investigate how
mechanical events are transmitted through the skin. In this study, we visualize
the internal skin strains in response to soft brushing stimuli using functional
Optical Coherence Tomography (fOCT), which provides depth-resolved time-series
data of the displacement of the skin. Driven with custom-made software, the
system enabled sub-surface imaging at a refresh rate of 10 kHz. Brushing was
applied to the back of the hand, and skin displacement was observed at
different depths. The results show that each skin layer responds differently to
the stimulus, suggesting that internal skin dynamics play a role in tactile
perception. This method offers a way to investigate how mechanical events
within the skin relate to sensory function.

*Bradley D. Keister,Saeed Najafi,Joan-Emma Shea,Krastan B. Blagoev*

TL;DR: This paper discusses the absence of Ostwald ripening in out-of-equilibrium liquid droplets and suggests it may help stabilize droplets in biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by understanding the mechanisms behind droplet stabilization in biological contexts, such as cells.

Method: They used molecular dynamics to simulate systems with particles undergoing state transitions or momentum changes, measuring the absence of Ostwald ripening away from equilibrium.

Result: Ostwald ripening is absent when the system is out of equilibrium.

Conclusion: This suggests that droplets in living cells are stabilized through mechanisms resembling Ostwald ripening avoiding, possibly by operating out of equilibrium, which could relate to biological stability mechanisms.

Abstract: Absence of Ostwald ripening has been observed in living cells, which operate
out of equilibrium. Using molecular dynamics we study the behaviour of liquid
droplets away from equilibrium in a system of particles interacting with each
other via several central potential. The system is driven out of equilibrium
either by the particles randomly transitioning between two states, or by
randomly changing their momenta. In all cases Ostwald ripening is absent only
away from equilibrium. This phenomena, might be the mechanism by which droplets
in living cells are stabilized.

Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is
essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we
systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and
F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular
dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic
potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong
dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters,
highlighting that --without due care-- standard mixing rules can lead to
qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a
systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control
adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate
for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for
Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific
adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific
adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical
expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into
continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion
adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential
of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results
underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced
interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at
electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular
simulations and continuum electrochemical models.

*Hugh G. A. Burton*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new ROHF method using quasi-Newton optimization on the orbital manifold, improving convergence for low-spin open-shell systems and applying it to transition metals and polyacenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimizing low-spin open-shell systems in SCF theory motivates the development of a new ROHF algorithm.

Method: The method involves deriving a ROHF algorithm through Riemannian optimization on the orbital manifold, extending the Geometric Direct Minimization approach for open-shell systems.

Result: The new algorithm shows improved convergence, discovers multiple CSF minima in iron-sulfur complexes, and reveals polyradical behavior in polyacenes.

Conclusion: This technique provides a powerful tool for studying low-spin systems with various spin couplings and opens up applications in complex molecular systems.

Abstract: It has recently been shown that configuration state functions (CSF) with
local orbitals can provide a compact reference state for low-spin open-shell
electronic structures, such as antiferromagnetic states. However, optimizing a
low-spin configuration using self-consistent field (SCF) theory has been a
long-standing challenge, since each orbital must be an eigenfunction of a
different Fock operator. Here, I introduce a low-spin restricted open-shell
Hartree-Fock (ROHF) algorithm to optimize any CSF at mean-field cost. This
algorithm employs quasi-Newton Riemannian optimization on the orbital
constraint manifold to provide robust convergence, extending the Geometric
Direct Minimization approach to open-shell electronic structures with arbitrary
genealogical spin coupling. Numerical calculations on transition metal aquo
complexes show improved convergence over existing methodology, and reveal the
potential for many local CSF energy minima in iron-sulfur complexes. Finally,
open-shell CSFs with different spin coupling patterns are used to qualitatively
study the singlet ground state in polyacenes, revealing the onset of
polyradical character for increasing chain length.

### [116] [Optimization of Fragment State Spaces within the Excitonic Renormalization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23484)
*Marco Bauer,Patrick Norman,Andreas Dreuw,Anthony D. Dutoi*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an optimized method for the excitonic renormalization framework, which allows for the efficient computation of weakly interacting systems by reducing the size of model state spaces while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of efficiently building model state spaces for isolated fragments in the excitonic renormalization framework without significantly losing accuracy by introducing an algorithm that utilizes gradient information and pre-screening techniques.

Method: The method involves using gradients at three different levels and efficiently pre-screening determinants to construct compact model state spaces. This approach avoids building full monomer state spaces while still capturing the necessary information to accurately recover results up to the first order.

Result: Numerical results on the beryllium dimer show that the algorithm successfully constructs compact model state spaces and recovers results that closely match optimal model spaces, demonstrating the method's efficacy. Additionally, optimizing at the zeroth order allows accurate first-order results to be achieved efficiently, significantly speeding up the optimization process.

Conclusion: The presented solver completes the excitonic renormalization framework by providing a polynomially scaling, efficient method for building optimized model state spaces without the computational overhead of full Hamiltonian constructions.

Abstract: The recently proposed excitonic renormalization framework presents an
alternative ansatz to elec- tronic structure theory of weakly interacting
fragments. It makes use of absolutely localized orbitals and correlated states
evaluated on isolated fragments, which are then used to recover the interaction
in an ab-initio manner based on a biorthogonal framework. The correlated
monomer information can be heavily truncated, and the Hamiltonian can be
expanded in a rapidly converging series, allow- ing the Hamiltonian to be built
and diagonalized in a scalable fashion. However, the methodology still lacks an
efficient bottom-up procedure, capable of producing optimized model state
spaces for the isolated fragments, without ever building the Hamiltonian in the
full monomer state spaces. In order to address this issue, this work presents
an algorithm utilizing monomer gradients at three different levels as well as
an efficient pre-screening of the determinant space, ensuring compact model
state spaces and intermediates. Numerical results are presented for the
beryllium dimer, showing that the algorithm is indeed capable of building
compact model state spaces, yielding results that closely resemble those of the
optimal model state spaces. Furthermore, it is shown that model state spaces,
optimized at the zeroth order of the Hamiltonian expansion, can also be used to
accurately recover first order results, enabling very efficient optimization,
as the optimization can be conducted at a lower order than the targeted final
level. Hence, the presented solver completes the excitonic renormalization
methodology, forming a polynomially scaling framework.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of accurate quantum mechanical treatment of molecular reactions, particularly those with deep potential wells and long-lived intermediates. They introduce an Interaction Region Decoupling (IRD) strategy that splits the interaction region into reactant and product subspaces using structured absorbing potentials. The IRD framework integrates with TDWP methods, improving computational efficiency by orders of magnitude. They validate it on F+HD and O+OH reactions, achieving state-resolved accuracy and significant cost reduction, enabling complex four-atom reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular reactions involving complex potentials and long-lived intermediates are difficult to model accurately. This paper proposes a new method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of such quantum mechanical treatments, which is crucial for understanding fundamental chemical processes and practical applications in chemistry and physics.

Method: The paper introduces an Interaction Region Decoupling (IRD) strategy that splits the interaction region into reactant and product subspaces. This method is used in tandem with standard Time-Dependent Wcapture (TDWP) schemes to construct region-specific basis sets, thereby enhancing computational efficiency significantly.

Result: The benchmark applications to F + HD and O + OH reactions show that the IRD method achieves state-resolved accuracy while reducing computational cost by over two orders of magnitude, demonstrating significant efficiency gains that enable the treatment of complex four-atom reactions.

Conclusion: This hybrid method effectively addresses the challenges of long reaction pathways and deep potential wells by dynamically partitioning the interaction region, allowing for accurate computation of state-resolved cross-sections with drastically reduced computational cost. As a result, four-atom reaction pathways that were previously intractable can now be modeled routine in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Accurate quantum mechanical treatment of molecular reactions remains a
longstanding challenge, especially for reactions involving deep potential wells
and long-lived intermediate complexes. Here, we introduce an interaction region
decoupling (IRD) strategy that incorporates structured absorbing potentials to
dynamically partition the interaction region into reactant and product
subspaces. The IRD framework integrates naturally with standard TDWP
propagation schemes and enables the construction of region-specific basis sets,
dramatically enhancing computational efficiency. Benchmark applications to the
F + HD and O + OH reactions demonstrate that this approach achieves
state-resolved accuracy while reducing computational cost by over two orders of
magnitude. This strategy paves the way for routine quantum mechanical treatment
of complex-forming four-atom reactions previously considered intractable.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Synthesizing new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a challenging task, as
the size, morphology, polymorph and type and number of defects present on the
synthesis product may depend on many variables, including temperature, solvent,
concentration and nature of reactants, among others. A deeper understanding on
how synthesis conditions determine the obtained material is crucial to optimize
the use of resources when synthesizing new MOFs. In this contribution, we study
the impact of changing concentration, solvent and temperature on the molecular
level mechanisms of the solvothermal nucleation process of ZIF-8 relying on
molecular dynamics simulations using a force field that incorporates
metal-ligand reactivity. We find that the nucleation is faster when the
synthesis is performed in dimethylsulfoxide than when it is performed in
methanol, in alignment with experimental observations. In the early steps of
the nucleation process, we observe the formation of linear oligomers containing
metal ions and ligands, which start forming cycles later on. All simulations
lead to the formation of a final state that is highly-connected and partially
amorphous, which could be correlated to an intermediate species observed in
direct experiments. The mechanism of formation of this phase mainly consists of
the merging of smaller nuclei. Even though increasing temperature and the
reactants concentration lead to a similar nucleation speedup, there are
differences in ring populations and lifetimes within the highly-connected
amorphous intermediate phases that are formed in each case. Finally, important
differences in the free energy of Zn-2-methylimidazolate versus Zn-imidazolate
subsequent binding events are revealed and discussed.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method (GBBD) for calculating the exact eigenvalues of low-energy states in molecular systems using graph theory and block-diagonalization, demonstrated with hydrogen chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular systems' exact eigenvalues are challenging to compute, so this paper aims to find an efficient method by leveraging graph-based decomposition and block-diagonalization.

Method: The approach uses graph theory to represent non-zero Hamiltonian matrix elements as edges, leading to cluster decomposition for independent blocks. Each cluster corresponds to a block, with eigenvalues found by solving each block's eigenvalue problem and a modified Hamiltonian to ensure orthonormality constraints.

Result: The GBBD method accurately and efficiently calculates eigenvalues for linear hydrogen chains (H2 to H12) with high agreement to exact results.

Conclusion: GBBD provides an accurate and efficient solution for low-energy state calculations in molecular systems, validated through hydrogen chains analysis.

Abstract: We developed a graph-based block-diagonalization (GBBD) method for the full
configuration interaction Hamiltonian of molecular systems to efficiently
calculate the exact eigenvalues of low-energy states. In this approach, the
non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are represented as edges on a
graph, which naturally decomposes into disconnected clusters. Each cluster
corresponds to an independent block in the block-diagonalized form of the
Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues in the low-energy sector were obtained by solving
the eigenvalue problem for each block matrix and by solving a modified
Hamiltonian subject to orthonormality constraints with respect to previously
computed lower-energy eigenstates. We applied the GBBD method to linear
hydrogen H chains ranging from H$_2$ to H$_{12}$. The results showed excellent
agreement with exact ones, confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the
proposed method. Finally, we discussed several physical properties with respect
to the number of H$_2$ molecules.

*Nikita A. Nemkov,Stanislav S. Straupe*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses that coherent multiport interferometers have potential for matrix multiplication in integrated photonics but highlight the programming complexity and output energy limitations that affect their practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are addressing the challenges in mapping matrix elements to phase shifts in photonics devices, suggesting that despite potential benefits, the approach is still impractical due to complex programming and limited energy efficiency.

Method: Focuses on architectural analysis, complexity evaluation, and theoretical modeling to assess programming difficulties and output limitations.

Result: The study finds high programming complexity and lower useful output energy, which negatively impacts accuracy and efficiency, suggesting that current interferometers may not be suitable for practical applications.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that while architectures exist for matrix multiplication, the inherent complexity and energy constraints make them unsuitable for real-world use, indicating the need for alternative methods or designs in integrated optics.

Abstract: Coherent multiport interferometers are a promising approach to realize matrix
multiplication in integrated photonics. However, most known architectures -
such as MZI and beamsplitter meshes, as well as more general interferometers -
suffer from complicated procedures for mapping the matrix elements of the
desired transformation to specific phaseshifts in the device. We point out that
the high programming complexity is intrinsic, rather than accidental. At the
same time, we argue that interferometers admitting efficient programming
algorithms in general yield a much lower useful output energy, which ultimately
limits their accuracy and energy efficiency.

### [121] [Fundamental Limitations of Absolute Ranging via Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23183)

Main category: physics.optics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about metrology, specifically interferometry, which is a fundamental topic in physics and engineering. Achieving high precision in measurements is crucial for many applications, so understanding the limitations is important.

Method: The paper employs statistical analysis and mathematical modeling to evaluate the estimation accuracy of parameters in DFMI. It uses the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound, Non-Linear Least Squares, and Extended Kalman Filtering as tools for this analysis.

Result: The study reveals the fundamental limitations of DFMI in terms of systematic biases and statistical errors, along with optimal operating conditions that minimize these errors.

Conclusion: The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities in DFMI, which is essential for the design and improvement of metrological systems utilizing this technique.

Abstract: High-precision absolute length metrology using laser interferometry faces
inherent challenges from interferometric ambiguity. Deep Frequency Modulation
Interferometry (DFMI) addresses this by simultaneously extracting two distinct
length-encoding parameters: the precise, ambiguous interferometric phase
($\Phi$) and the coarser, unambiguous effective modulation depth ($m$). This
paper establishes the fundamental statistical and systematic limitations
governing the absolute accuracy of DFMI. We detail two primary readout
algorithms: a frequency-domain Non-Linear Least Squares (NLS) fit and a
time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bound (CRLB) for the estimation of $m$ and $\Phi$, identifying intrinsic ``dead
zones'' where precision degrades, and asymptotic limits as a function of signal
quality and integration time, achievable by both NLS and EKF. Critically, we
develop analytical models for dominant systematic biases, revealing previously
uncharted ``valleys of robustness'' -- specific operating points where errors
from modulation non-linearity and residual amplitude modulation are strongly
suppressed. This analysis clarifies critical trade-offs between different
design parameters, integration time, and total error, informing instrument
design and underscoring the necessity of advanced compensation techniques for
high-accuracy applications.

Abstract: A Si slab waveguide resonator design with a circulating Gaussian-like cavity
mode is described and characterized, for both all-pass and add-drop
configurations and several different input/output coupling strengths. The
circulating beam propagates in a slab waveguide with no lateral confinement.
Three straight mirrors and one curved mirror define a folded two-dimensional
Gaussian cavity. Light is coupled to and from the resonator by beam splitters
formed by a narrow gap between a cavity mirror and the input slab waveguides.
The coupling is determined by the gap width and is wavelength independent and
lossless. For a L=100 um path length cavity, resonance line widths of 5 pm with
Q-values of Q = 310000 were measured. The resonator drop spectrum exhibited a
comb of almost identical resonance lines across a 100 nm tuning range. This
resonator design is capable of broadband operation and is less susceptible to
sidewall roughness and defect scattering induced loss and mode splitting, when
compared with Si rings formed from narrow single mode waveguides.

Method: The paper investigates HG's plasmonic modes and optical conductivity through computational modeling under varying hole radii and periodic configurations, identifying flat and hyperbolic plasmons.

Result: Tunable plasmons and anisotropic optical behavior were observed in HG configurations with larger holes.

Conclusion: Holey graphene is identified as a promising candidate for nanophotonic applications due to its tunable properties and hyperbolic plasmons.

Abstract: Holey graphene (HG) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) material that has
attracted considerable attention due to its remarkable electrical, thermal, and
mechanical properties. The recent discovery of flat bands in HG has garnered
significant interest. In this work, we systematically investigate the tunable
plasmonic modes and optical conductivity of HG at or near the flat band
condition by changing the holes radii and periodic configuration. It is found
that HG presents nearly flat plasmonic bands in configurations with larger hole
radii. Hyperbolic plasmons are found due to the breaking of the graphene's
bipartite sublattice symmetry induced by the holes. Such an effect is also
confirmed by looking at the optical conductivity, that also presents a marked
anisotropy. The material's marked optical anisotropy leads to hyperbolic
plasmons, making it a promising platform for nanophotonic applications.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges and solutions for accurately simulating optical images of three-dimensional transparent objects. They propose ray tracing simulations that replicate microscopy images, including details like illumination ray distribution and spatial accuracy, and apply these to simulate complex phenomena like pressure waves in liquids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of optical image simulations, particularly for transparent 3D objects, by addressing issues like refraction and providing methods that closely match experimental results.

Method: They employ ray tracing simulations, focusing on replicating spatial and angular distributions of illumination rays and designing both experiments and simulations for accurate optical modeling.

Result: The simulations successfully replicate brightfield microscopy images and features like pressure waves, showing high fidelity compared to experiments.

Conclusion: The method enhances optical microscopy capabilities by enabling accurate 3D visualization and analysis of phenomena in transparent objects.

Abstract: Optical images of transparent three-dimensional objects can be different from
a replica of the object's cross section in the image plane, due to refraction
at the surface or in the body of the object. Simulations of the object's image
are thus needed for the visualization and validation of physical models, but
previous image simulations for fluid dynamics showed significant differences
from experiments. We report ray tracing image simulations that replicate with
high fidelity brightfield microscopy images of drops with complex shapes, and
images of pressure and shock waves traveling inside them. For high fidelity,
the simulations must replicate the spatial and angular distribution of
illumination rays, and both the experiment and the simulation must be designed
for accurate optical modeling. These techniques are directly applicable to
optical microscopy and expand the type and the accuracy of three-dimensional
information that can be extracted from optical images.

Abstract: Addressing the problem of photon multiple scattering interference caused by
turbid media in optical measurements, biomedical imaging, environmental
monitoring and other fields, existing Monte Carlo light scattering simulations
widely adopt the Henyey-Greenstein (H-G) phase function approximation model.
However, traditional computational resource limitations and high numerical
complexity have constrained the application of precise scattering models.
Moreover, the single-parameter anisotropy factor assumption neglects
higher-order scattering effects and backscattering intensity, failing to
accurately characterize the multi-order scattering properties of complex media.
To address these issues, we propose a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo-Rigorous Mie
scattering transport model for complex scattering environments. The model
employs rigorous Mie scattering theory to replace the H-G approximation,
achieving efficient parallel processing of phase function sampling and complex
scattering processes through pre-computed cumulative distribution function
optimization and deep integration with CUDA parallel architecture. To validate
the model accuracy, a standard scattering experimental platform based on
5{\mu}m polystyrene microspheres was established, with multiple optical depth
experimental conditions designed, and spatial registration techniques employed
to achieve precise alignment between simulation and experimental images. The
research results quantitatively demonstrate the systematic accuracy advantages
of rigorous Mie scattering phase functions over H-G approximation in simulating
lateral scattering light intensity distributions, providing reliable
theoretical foundations and technical support for high-precision optical
applications in complex scattering environments.

Abstract: Atomic layer materials have emerged as essential building blocks for next
generation quantum and semiconductor technologies, where atomic scale control
over light matter interactions is critical. However, their inherently small
optical interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient
integration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation
requires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance
atomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, air suspended nanomembranes with
extreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for
integrating atomic layer materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate
an ultrathin freestanding photonic nanomembrane with a thickness down to 29 nm
comparable to that of atomic layer materials enabling atomic scale control of
light coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the
surface and significantly enhances light matter interaction. Through the
integration of atomic layer material, we achieve angstrom level thickness
modulation, where a single atomic-layer-deposition cycle corresponding to a
thickness increment of 0.65 angstrom results in a 0.09 nm shift in the high Q
resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and
deterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface. This approach
provides a scalable and versatile route for atomic-scale light coupling,
effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional photonics and enabling
progress in quantum photonics, 2D optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor
technologies.

Abstract: This study explores the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology
tool for blazed gratings. In grazing incidence geometry, one can measure both
the conical diffraction and the diffuse scattering on the grating
simultaneously in a single scattering pattern. The sensitivity of scattering
patterns to the structure of the blazed gratings is evaluated. The diffraction
component of the pattern is shown to be sensitive to the average groove profile
of the gratings. Meanwhile, the diffuse scattering depends on the roughness
morphology of the reflective surface of blazed gratings. These findings are
supported by numerical simulations. The simulations were performed using
several rigorous solvers for the Helmholtz equations, and with a perturbation
theory. The analysis relies on synchrotron data, as well as data from atomic
force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The aim of this article is
to draw the attention of the optical community to the synchrotron measurements
as a nanometrology tool for the modern optical elements.

Conclusion: 该研究为光纤激光器的控制和优化提供了新思路，展示了亚谐波捕获在光子学应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Synchronization is ubiquitous across a wide range of fields. Subharmonic
entrainment (SHE) is a nonlinear synchronization phenomenon that results in a
locking oscillator at a frequency of an external periodic forcing signal with a
fraction of the oscillator frequency. Beyond the fundamentals of nonlinear
dynamics, SHE has a range of practical applications from stabilizing ultrafast
laser pulses to optimizing control in various engineering and natural systems.
However, the vectorial nature of SHE remains elusive. Here, we present the
results of a theoretical and experimental study of a vector type of subharmonic
entrainment (VSHE) using a passively mode-locked fiber laser as a testbed. We
unveil the mechanism of vectorial SHE, in which weak external signals can
entrain internal laser dynamics through vectorial coupling. Vectorial SHE
presents in the form of synchronization between the subharmonic of
mode-locking-driven oscillations and continuous wave (CW) signal through an
evolving state of polarization. This CW signal, driven by the internal dynamics
of the injected signal, causes VSHE with the frequencies ratios of multiples of
ten, resulting in a partially mode-locking regime operation. Our findings offer
new control techniques over mode-locking and additional dimension such as
polarization states.

Abstract: We report on some properties of a quantum black hole obtained recently. The
correction to the Newtonian gravitational potential is proportional to a
coupling $\alpha$, which is the only free parameter of the theory. We constrain
the coupling using the perihelion advance, we compute the quasi-normal modes
for scalar (both massless and massive) and electromagnetic perturbations. We
find that all modes computed here are complex numbers characterized by a
positive real part and a negative imaginary part, while both parts increase
with the mass of the test scalar field. Also thermodynamics properties are
investigated from the classical and topological point of view. In this regard,
the quantum black hole exhibits the same behavior as the classical
Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, that is, it presents stable/unstable branches
in the Gibbs potential, one generating point and a topological charge $W=0$.

### [132] [Consequences of Undecidability in Physics on the Theory of Everything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22950)
*Mir Faizal,Lawrence M. Krauss,Arshid Shabir,Francesco Marino*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper discusses the limitations of algorithmic approaches in unifying quantum gravity and spacetime, using Gödel's, Tarski's, and Chaitin's incompleteness theorems to argue against a 'Theory of Everything' that relies solely on algorithms. It introduces a 'Meta-Theory of Everything' that incorporates non-algorithmic understanding to account for undecidable phenomena and concludes that the universe cannot be simulated as an algorithmic system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether the universe can be entirely simulated or understood through algorithmic means, which is a significant question in theoretical physics and computer science. By applying various incompleteness theorems, it challenges the notion of a complete algorithmic 'Theory of Everything' and suggests that some aspects of reality require a non-algorithmic basis.

Method: The authors use logical frameworks from mathematics, particularly G"odel's incompleteness theorems, Tarski's undefinability theorem, and Chaitin's information-theoretic limits, to argue against a purely algorithmic theory. They construct a 'Meta-Theory of Everything' that includes these limitations and draws conclusions about the nature of physical reality and simulation.

Result: The paper concludes that an algorithmic Theory of Everything is impossible due to these inherent limitations, suggesting that some aspects of reality are beyond algorithmic computation and thus require a different form of understanding. This also implies that the universe cannot be simulated as a purely algorithmic system.

Conclusion: The authors argue that because any computational model of the universe is limited by these incompleteness theorems, the universe itself cannot be a simulation. This challenges the idea of a digital or algorithmic universe and suggests that non-algorithmic processes are fundamental to the structure of reality.

Abstract: General relativity treats spacetime as dynamical and exhibits its breakdown
at singularities. This failure is interpreted as evidence that quantum gravity
is not a theory formulated within spacetime; instead, it must explain the very
emergence of spacetime from deeper quantum degrees of freedom, thereby
resolving singularities. Quantum gravity is therefore envisaged as an axiomatic
structure, and algorithmic calculations acting on these axioms are expected to
generate spacetime. However, G\"odel's incompleteness theorems, Tarski's
undefinability theorem, and Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness
establish intrinsic limits on any such algorithmic programme. Together, these
results imply that a wholly algorithmic "Theory of Everything" is impossible:
certain facets of reality will remain computationally undecidable and can be
accessed only through non-algorithmic understanding. We formalize this by
constructing a "Meta-Theory of Everything" grounded in non-algorithmic
understanding, showing how it can account for undecidable phenomena and
demonstrating that the breakdown of computational descriptions of nature does
not entail a breakdown of science. Because any putative simulation of the
universe would itself be algorithmic, this framework also implies that the
universe cannot be a simulation.

### [133] [Comment on "Quantum tunneling from Schwarzschild black hole in non-commutative gauge theory of gravity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22965)
*A. A. Araújo Filho,Iarley P. Lobo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper identifies inconsistencies in the calculation of event horizon for a Schwarzschild non-commutative black hole, affecting subsequent results. The authors need to correct the event horizon to resolve the issues.ativelyy to fix the issue, leading to meaningful corrections in the study. It suggests that the results depend critically on correctly determining the event horizon, and the authors should address this to validate their findings. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of accurate calculations in the context of black hole physics and quantum tunneling processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper discusses a black hole solution in non-commutative spacetime and explores particle creation via quantum tunneling. The identified inconsistencies in calculating the event horizon are critical because the event horizon is a fundamental property of black holes, and any error would propagate through all subsequent calculations. The corrections needed could significantly impact the validity of the results and understanding of black hole physics.

Method: The method employed in the paper involves solving Einstein field equations to determine the event horizon in the Schwarzschild non-commutative black hole solution. However, there are errors in solving these equations, leading to incorrect determination of the event horizon and, consequently, flawed results in the particle creation calculation via quantum tunneling.

Result: The incorrect determination of the event horizon leads to flawed calculations regarding particle creation via quantum tunneling in Schwarzschild non-commutative black holes. The paper points out that these inconsistencies were replicated in multiple other papers by the same authors, highlighting a broader issue in their methodology or calculations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that proper determination of the event horizon is vital for accurate calculations of particle creation via quantum tunneling in Schwarzschild non-commutative black holes. The authors should correct the event horizon calculations and validate their results to ensure the reliability of their findings in the context of black hole physics and quantum gravity.

Abstract: The particle creation via quantum tunneling was recently calculated for the
Schwarzschild non-commutative black hole solution in Ref. [Phys. Lett. B 848
(2024) 138335, e-Print: 2310.02445 [gr-qc]]. Nevertheless, it contains
inconsistencies in the calculations that need to be properly corrected. In
particular, the event horizon was incorrectly determined in that work, which
affected all the subsequent calculations. Moreover, the same issue have been
repeated elsewhere by the same authors in Refs. [1-4].

Conclusion: 引力波探测器无法通过观察处处的相位变化来探测黑洞的二次变形效应，因此此类效应可能无法由未来 detectors直接测 试探测。

Abstract: In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish
identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e.,
in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated
by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at
finite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of
a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By
employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are
regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme.
Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the
perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our
analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order
and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale
dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing
conservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly
demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We
then assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the
gravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express
the correction in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to
be matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we
argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with
future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding
phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering
at the same post-Newtonian order.

Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian
spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is
considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the
Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on
a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum
tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations,
eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can
be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum
tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a
suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor
polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the
constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic
damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter
coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where
propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in
the frequency spectrum.

Abstract: We study the inextensibility problem of the spacetime at a future boundary
point. We detect the inextensibility of the spacetime by the
volume-distance-ratio asymptote of the timelike diamond approaching the future
boundary point. The fundamental idea is to compare the asymptote with the one
in Minkowski spacetime. By this idea, we establish the inextensibility criteria
for both $C^{0,1}$ and $C^0$ regularities. As applications, we prove that i)
$C^{0,1}$-inextensibility of the interior solution of the spherically
self-similar naked singularity in the gravitational collapse of a massless
scalar field constructed by Christodoulou. The key estimate is on the volume
form of the interior solution of the naked singularity in a self-similar
coordinate system. ii) $C^0$-inextensibility of the spatially flat FLRW
spacetime with asymptotically linear scale factor $a(t) \sim t$. The key
estimate is the volume comparison with the spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime
with the scale factor $t$ which is the causal past of a point in the Minkowski

Conclusion: 这项研究为探索更复杂的量子引力理论提供了一种新的方法，特别是通过比较不同模型的模拟结果，可以用来测试和约束新的引力理论。这一发现为未来的实验和理论研究提供了重要的指导。

Abstract: We employ multiple-scale analysis to systematically derive analytical
approximations describing the cosmological propagation of gravitational waves
beyond general relativity, in a framework with two interacting spin-2 fields
with time-dependent couplings. Such techniques allow us to accurately track the
evolution of a system with slowly evolving time-dependent couplings over a
large number of oscillation periods. We focus on tensor modes propagating on
sub-horizon scales in a universe dominated by dark energy and explicitly derive
solutions for a general class of models. To illustrate the possible
applications of our general scheme and further corroborate our analytical
results, we calculate the evolution of tensor perturbations in some
phenomenological toy models and compare them with numerical simulations. We
show that, generically, the interactions of independent spin-2 fields lead to
non-trivial modifications to the amplitude and phase of the detected waveform,
which are different from those obtained in other modified gravity theories with
a single graviton. This provides an avenue to test and constrain gravitational
models with new fundamental physical fields.

Conclusion: 研究可能用于缩小凯氏-纽曼正则扩展的候选项，达夫点的热力学性质需深入探索。

Abstract: In addition to curvature singularities, electrovacuum black holes in general
relativity exhibit thermodynamic singularities. These so-called Davies' points
occur at non-extremal values of charge and spin where the heat capacity
diverges and may indicate a type of theoretical incompleteness. The
thermodynamic regularity of several families of static, asymptotically-flat
spacetimes with bounded curvature invariants is examined using a
theory-agnostic framework, showing that while they may be regular in physical
space they are generally not in phase space. The inclusion of angular momentum,
via the Newman-Janis algorithm, makes the set of such "doubly regular" objects
especially restrictive. It is argued that, if thermodynamic regularity is to be
considered a desirable property for an astrophysical black hole, these
considerations could be used to narrow down the viable pool of regular
extensions to the Kerr-Newman metric.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a Lagrangian model describing a particle
constrained to move along non-degenerate conic sections, parameterized by the
orbital eccentricity \( e \). In the non-relativistic regime, we apply the
Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to identify a set of four second-class constraints,
compute the corresponding Dirac brackets, and isolate the true physical degrees
of freedom. This procedure yields a unified Hamiltonian treatment of circular
(\( e = 0 \)), elliptical (\( 0 < e < 1 \)), parabolic (\( e = 1 \)), and
hyperbolic (\( e > 1 \)) trajectories. We then extend the analysis to the
relativistic case, where we observe a similar constraint structure and
construct the associated Dirac brackets accordingly. Finally, using the
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we identify a set of non-involutive constraints; by
introducing generalized brackets, we restore integrability and derive the
correct equations of motion. A comparative analysis of both formalisms
highlights their complementary features and deepens our understanding of the
dynamics governing particles restricted to conic geometries.

with positive-definite configuration variables. We then explore whether the
quantum effects encoded in this wave function can lead to the avoidance of
classical singularities.

Abstract: We shall investigate the inflation for the D-brane model, motivated by the
modified gravity $F(\phi,T)$. This gravity has been recently introduced in the
literature. The feasibility of the D-brane inflation theory in the
$F(\phi,T)$-gravity has been studied in conjunction with the most recent Planck
data. We shall analyze the slow-roll inflation in the context of the
$F(\phi)T$-gravity, via the D-brane model. Then, we shall calculate the
inflation dynamics to obtain the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$'' and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio ``$r$''. Besides, we investigate the dynamics of the
reheating for this model. Our model accurately covers the left-hand side of the
Planck data and the D-brane inflation.

Abstract: Recent advances in noncommutative geometry and string theory have stimulated
increasing research on noncommutative gravity. The detection of gravitational
waves~(GW) opens a new window for testing this theory using observed data. In
particular, the leading correction from noncommutative gravity to the GW of
compact binary coalescences appears at the second post-Newtonian~(2PN) order.
This correction is proportional to the dimensionless parameter
$\Lambda\equiv|\theta^{0i}|/(l_Pt_P)$, where $\theta^{0i}$ denotes the
antisymmetric tensor characterizing noncommutative spacetime, and $l_P, t_P$
represent the Plank length and time, respectively. Previous study have used the
phase deviation from general relativity at the 2PN order, as measured in
GW150914, to constrain noncommutative gravity, resulting in an upper bound of
$\sqrt{\Lambda}<3.5$. Another analysis, based on multiple events from the
GWTC-1 catalog, has obtained consistent bounds. In this work, we construct the
noncommutative gravity waveform in the Parameterized Post-Einsteinian
framework. Based on the \texttt{IMRPhenomXHM} template, we incorporate both the
dominant (2,2) mode and several higher-order modes, including (2,1), (3,3),
(3,2), and (4,4). We first reanalyze the GW150914 with a Bayesian parameter
estimation and derive a 95th percentile upper bound on noncommutative gravity,
obtaining $\sqrt{\Lambda}<0.68$. We then analyze GW190814 and obtain an even
tighter 95th percentile upper bound of $\sqrt{\Lambda}<0.46$. This represent
the strongest constraint on noncommutative gravity derived from real GW
observations to date.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个微观、代数的方法，寻求黑洞信息悖论的解决方案，并将量子引力与拓扑量子计算联系起来。

Abstract: We model black holes as condensates of non-Abelian anyons forming a
topologically ordered shell at the horizon. Combined with area quantization,
the constrained fusion Hilbert space yields a discrete entropy spectrum
consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. Assuming a quantized mass
spectrum with nonuniform gaps, we derive a nonthermal radiation profile with a
corrected Hawking temperature and entropy, including logarithmic and
inverse-area corrections. This framework localizes quantum information to the
horizon without invoking entanglement across it, offering a unitary evaporation
mechanism governed by topological degrees of freedom. This offers a natural
setting for resolving the information paradox without recourse to firewalls,
remnants, or trans-horizon entanglement. We also show that the Hawking
temperature arises from classical equipartition on the shell, explaining the
thermal character of the spectrum at leading order. Overall, our results
provide a microscopic, algebraic approach to the black hole information paradox
and establish a bridge between quantum gravity and topological quantum
computation.

*Pangiotis Dorlis,Nick E. Mavromatos,Sarben Sarkar,Sotirios-Neilos Vlachos*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method involving Kerr black holes and axion fields to generate squeezed graviton states, relying primarily on general relativity effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the generation of squeezed graviton states using extreme astrophysical objects and quantum field effects within them.

Method: The authors use a (3+1)-dimensional spacetime model with Kerr-type black holes and axions that acquire mass due to interactions, leading to superradiance and graviton pair production in a squeezed state.

Result: The study finds that general relativity dominates the squeezing effects, while the CS anomaly terms have negligible impact. Squeezing is achievable with sufficiently long axion cloud lifetimes.

Conclusion: The primary source of squeezing is general relativity, and the method offers a new astrophysical process for generating highly squeezed graviton states.

Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of
squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding
rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions
is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and
compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries
exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan
theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons
(CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a
Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance
and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The
specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are
massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a
Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it
is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity
(GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to
the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the
axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through
the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be
produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the
structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a
left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the
anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses the construction and properties of Penrose diagrams for Schwarzschild spacetime, using detailed mathematical derivations and historical references. It serves as an educational resource for physics and mathematics graduate students to understand the visualization of spacetime and coordinate systems in general relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penrose diagrams are a complex topic in general relativity, so this paper aims to simplify their understanding through detailed explanations and examples.

Method: The paper explains the construction method of Penrose diagrams, using the maximal analytic extension of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime as an example. It includes mathematical rigor, historical context, and visual analysis.

Result: The paper successfully constructs a Penrose diagram for the given spacetime and highlights key characteristics, aiding in the visualization of spacetime and coordinate systems.

Conclusion: It is a valuable educational resource for students of general relativity and differential geometry, providing a clear introduction to Penrose diagrams and their applications.

Abstract: We present a detailed, mathematically rigorous description of the
construction procedure of Penrose diagrams for the example of the maximal
analytic extension of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. To this end, we
first outline the basic idea underlying Penrose diagrams, state the general
requirements on the spacetimes to be visualized, and give a definition of
Penrose diagrams. We then construct the Penrose diagram of the maximally
analytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime and discuss the characteristics
and properties corresponding to this particular Penrose diagram. As an
application, we work out the differences between the spacetime and null
variants of the canonical advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate
representations of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime by explicitly
constructing and visually analyzing Penrose diagrams equipped with foliations
of the level sets of the respective Eddington-Finkelstein time and null
coordinates. Throughout the course of the paper, we provide brief accounts of
the relevant parts of the seminal publications on the exterior Schwarzschild
solution by Schwarzschild himself, Kruskal, Eddington, Finkelstein, and
Penrose. This paper is primarily of pedagogical nature aimed at graduate
students in physics and applied mathematics (with a background in general
relativity and differential geometry), serving mainly as an introduction to
Penrose diagrams and coordinate representations of the exterior Schwarzschild
spacetime.

Result: 非自旋黑洞比例不符合默认模型，但可能由10%-80%的非自旋黑洞解释。

Conclusion: 双黑洞样本中存在显著自旋差异，非自旋黑洞数量无法确认，需要更多数据。

Abstract: The individual component spins of binary black holes (BBH) are difficult to
resolve using gravitational-wave observations but carry key signatures of the
processes shaping their formation and evolution. Recent analyses have found
conflicting evidence for a sub-population of black holes with negligible spin,
but the Default spin magnitude population model used in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
analyses cannot formally accommodate an excess of systems with zero spin. In
this work, we analyze several different simulated BBH populations to
demonstrate that even in the face of this mismodeling, spinning and nonspinning
populations can be reliably distinguished using the Default spin magnitude
population model coupled with spin sorting. While typical analyses sort the
binary components by their masses, sorting the components by their spin
magnitudes instead offers a complementary view of the properties of individual
systems consistent with equal mass and of population-level properties, given
binary evolution processes like tidal-spin up that predict asymmetric spin
magnitudes among the binary components. We conclude that current observations
of the BBH population are inconsistent with a fully nonspinning population, but
could be explained by a population with only one spinning black hole per binary
or a population with up to 80% nonspinning sources.

*Sebastian Brezina,Eugenia Boffo,Martin Krššák*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper poses arguments for using the connection languages of affine or orthonormal bundles with specific structure groups for expressing TEGR as a gauge theory. It considers the treatment of the teleparallel connection and its implications on gauge symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is exploring how to formulate TEGR, an alternative to General Relativity, as a gauge theory, which requires understanding its connections and symmetries.

Method: The authors examine alternative connection languages and analyze gauge symmetries using Trautman's framework, focusing on the treatment of the teleparallel connection.

Result: The paper demonstrates that depending on the treatment of the teleparallel connection, TEGR's gauge group can vary between subgroups of the diffeomorphism group.

Conclusion: TEGR can be expressed as a gauge theory with its gauge group varying based on how the teleparallel connection is handled.

Abstract: We examine whether the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR)
can be formulated as a gauge theory in the language of connections on principal
bundles. We argue in favor of using either the affine bundle with the
Poincar\'e group or, equivalently, the orthonormal frame bundle with the
Lorentz group as the structure group. Following the framework of
Trautman--where gauge symmetries are determined using the absolute elements--we
set to identify the absolute elements and gauge symmetries of TEGR. The problem
of a non-dynamical teleparallel connection raises the question of whether it
should be treated as an absolute element. If so, the gauge group of TEGR is
potentially some undetermined subgroup of the diffeomorphism group. On the
other hand, if the connection is allowed to be non-dynamical but the only
absolute element is taken to be the canonical 1-form of the frame bundle, we
recover the whole diffeomorphism group as the gauge group of TEGR.

### [149] [Simulating Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Finite-temperature Equations of State: The influences of the slope of the symmetry energy and artificial heating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23684)
*Henrique Gieg,Maximiliano Ujevic,Armen Sedrakian,Tim Dietrich*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents numerical simulations of neutron star mergers to explore observable signatures related to the symmetry energy's slope and other parameters. Their findings suggest that structural modifications from varying symmetry energy could explain differences in ejecta composition and r-process yields, particularly at lower masses. However, distinguishing these effects through gravitational waves or electromagnetic counterparts, especially kilonovas, remains challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of neutron star mergers and their potential electromagnetic counterparts is crucial for studying fundamental physics, such as the equation of state of nuclear matter and the behavior of r-process nucleosynthesis.

Method: Numerical relativity simulations using equations of state parameterized with symmetry energy and skewness, employing an M1 moment scheme to model ejecta properties.

Result: Variations in symmetry energy slope affect ejecta properties, including composition and r-process yields, especially for lower mass nuclei. Ejecta characteristics are key but may not provide a clear link to gravitational waves or electromagnetic signals.

Conclusion: The simulations provide evidence for the influence of symmetry energy on ejecta and r-process, but further work is needed to better connect these observations to electromagnetic counterparts and gravitational wave signals.

Abstract: We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary
neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope
of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of
equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density
functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of
$L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a
set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of
state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with
subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related
structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with
theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves
are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we
find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations,
which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our
extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find
that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower
mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts
are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm
sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the
ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.

*Panagiotis Dorlis,Nick E. Mavromatos,Sarben Sarkar,Sotirios-Neilos Vlachos*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper shows that general relativity (GR) dominates over Chern-Simons (CS) gravity in creating highly squeezed graviton states through axion interactions with Kerr black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the production mechanisms of entangled gravitons and comparing different gravity theories' roles is important for quantum gravity research and tests of GR in extreme conditions.

Method: Analytical study focusing on the squeezing effect caused by gravitational interactions, comparing contributions from GR and CS terms through axion-related processes.

Result: GR-mediated squeezing is much stronger than CS-mediated squeezing, especially when considering long-lived axion clouds.

Conclusion: GR contributes dominantly to the generation of squeezed graviton states, reinforcing its role in quantum gravity phenomena.

Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS)
gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the
production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This
involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a
superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of
the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the
squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the
superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR
process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many
orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons,
induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant
squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose
lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is
effective.
