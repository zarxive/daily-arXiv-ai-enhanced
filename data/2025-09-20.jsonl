To\novercome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural\nNetwork (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The\narchitecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone\nwith a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state\nencoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum\nattention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark\ndatasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines,\nachieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and\n99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy\ndatasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior\ngeneralization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with\nsignificantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce\nscenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid\nquantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks."}

Arising from destructive interference\nprocesses, they are best seen in a Tavis-Cummings-like setup where two-level\natoms (or qubits) are placed within a lossy cavity. If the system is\ninitialized with some qubits excited and some in the ground state, there is a\nnon-zero probability that no photons will be emitted. This can be framed as a\nStern-Gerlach measurement, with a detector to measure if one or more photons\nleave the cavity. If no photons are detected, the qubits collapse onto a dark\nstate. This can be viewed as heralding of a dark state based on zero photon\ndetection. Building upon this idea, we propose a protocol to measure the number\nof independent dark states. Moreover, we show that this quantity is robust to\narbitrary levels of disorder in the qubit-photon coupling constants.

To mitigate these undesirable effects, a novel class of\n7-tert-butylpyren-2-ol derivatives with extended 'arm-like' substituents at the\n1,3-positions have been synthesized and their luminescent properties in\nsolution have been thoroughly investigated. While the 2- and 7-positions of the\npyrene core are frequently modified with hydroxyl and tert-butyl groups, this\nwork presents the first introduction of 'arm-like' substituents at the\n1,3-positions.

These effects\ntune pyrene's energy levels, demonstrating moderate (0.4) to high (0.7)\nfluorescence quantum yields and shorter-lived fluorescence lifetimes ranging\nfrom ca. 20 to 40 ns.

We\ndiscover a narrow parameter range in which the interplay of the tunneling\ndynamics with polariton-specific SO coupling leads to a new regime, with\ndynamical switching of the fluid's circular polarization degree to the\nopposite, along the entire ring or on just one of its halves. Our results\ndemonstrate polariton condensates in ring configurations as excellent\ncandidates for all-optical controllable spin-switch applications, with\nprospects for scalability and observing non-trivial polarization patterns."}

Meanwhile, anapole spectrally\naligns with FP anti-resonances, leading to weak coupling that narrows the\nlinewidth of the anapole's transmission peak by two orders of magnitude and\nenhances its local density of states (LDOS) near the metasurface\ncorrespondingly. With exceptional capabilities including formation of\npolaritons and significant enhancement of LDOS, the hybrid cavity enables\nstrong interaction with functional materials, paving the way for exploration of\nquantum optics, molecular sensing, and ultrafast nonlinear photonics."}

Under this\nassumption, the violation of Bell's inequality implies that either outcome\nindependence or parameter independence fails to hold, meaning that local hidden\nvariables do not exist. In this paper, we refer to this interpretive stance as\nthe nonfactorizable position. In contrast, superdeterminism represents the view\nthat measurement independence does not hold. Despite its foundational role,\nthis assumption has received relatively little philosophical scrutiny. This\npaper offers a philosophical reassessment of measurement independence through\nthree major frameworks in the philosophy of science: de Regt's contextual\ntheory of scientific understanding, Kuhn's criteria for theory choice, and\nLakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes. Using these lenses, we\nevaluate the two major responses to the violation of Bell's inequality, the\nnonfactorizable position and superdeterminism, and argue that the\nnonfactorizable position currently fares better across all three criteria.\nBeyond this binary, we introduce a spectrum of intermediate positions that\nallow for partial violations of measurement independence, modeled via mutual\ninformation. These positions modify the ``positive heuristic'' of\nsuperdeterminism, a crucial component in Lakatos's definition of research\nprogrammes, offering avenues for progressive research.

(ii) $s$-term DNF formulas in\nnear-polynomial time $\\textsf{poly}(n,(s/\\varepsilon)^{\\log \\log\ns/\\varepsilon})$.\n  Our main technical contribution is a quantum agnostic boosting protocol which\nconverts a weak agnostic learner, which outputs a parity state $|\\phi\\rangle$\nsuch that $|\\langle \\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^2\\geq \\textsf{opt}/\\textsf{poly}(n)$,\ninto a strong learner which outputs a superposition of parity states\n$|\\phi'\\rangle$ such that $|\\langle \\phi'|\\psi\\rangle|^2\\geq \\textsf{opt} -\n\\varepsilon$.\n  Using quantum agnostic boosting, we obtain the first near-polynomial time\n$n^{O(\\log \\log n)}$ algorithm for learning $\\textsf{poly}(n)$-sized depth-$3$\ncircuits (consisting of $\\textsf{AND}$, $\\textsf{OR}$, $\\textsf{NOT}$ gates) in\nthe uniform quantum $\\textsf{PAC}$ model using quantum examples. Classically,\nthe analogue of efficient learning depth-$3$ circuits (and even depth-$2$\ncircuits) in the uniform $\\textsf{PAC}$ model has been a longstanding open\nquestion in computational learning theory. Our work nearly settles this\nquestion, when the learner is given quantum examples."}

In the Caldeira--Leggett model, in the high-temperature\nlimit, we find that Krylov complexity saturates in the full system and\nreproduces the expected dissipative behavior when the decoherence term is\nsuppressed in the master equation. Conversely, when the dissipative term is\nsuppressed, the contribution from decoherence exhibits the familiar oscillatory\ndynamics of the coherent system, along with additional novel features.

Combining the confocal spectroscopy results\nand a detailed analysis of the MW-resonator-based experiments, we attribute the\nspin resonances to three different paramagnetic defects: positively-charged\ncarbon antisite vacancy pair (CAV$^+$), and the negatively-charged silicon\nvacancy spins located at two different lattice sites, namely V$_1$ and V$_2$\nspins. The V$_1$ and V$_2$ lines in SiC are interesting qubit transitions since\nthey are known to be robust to decoherence. Additionally, the\nCAV$^+$-transition is known to be a bright single-photon source. Consequently,\nthe demonstration of the joint coupling of these spin qubits to a MW cavity\nmode could lead to interesting new modalities: The microwave cavity could act\nas an information bus and mediate long-range coupling between the spins, with\npotential applications in quantum computing and quantum communication, which is\nan attractive proposition in a CMOS-compatible material such as SiC."}

Experimentally,\nsuch control can be achieved by pulsed modifications of the optical potential\nconfining the nanoparticle. Most frequently, the applied potential pulses are\nparabolic in nanoparticle position, and they expand/squeeze or displace the\ninitial Gaussian state of motion to a modified Gaussian state. The\ntime-dependent mean values and covariance matrix of the phase-space variables\ncan fully characterize such a state. However, quasi-parabolic optical\npotentials with added weak Duffing-type nonlinearity, encountered in real-world\nexperiments, can generally distort the state of motion to a non-Gaussian one,\nfor which the description based solely on the mean values and covariance matrix\nfails. Here, we introduce a nonlinear transformation of the phase-space\ncoordinates using the concept of Fermat's spiral, which effectively removes the\nstate distortion induced by the Duffing-type nonlinearity and enables\ncharacterization of the state of motion by the standard Gaussian-state metrics.\nComparisons of the experimental data with theoretical models show that the\nproposed coordinate transformation can recover the ideal behavior of a harmonic\noscillator even after extended evolution of the system in the nonlinear\npotential. The presented scheme enables the separation of the effects of the\napplied state manipulation, the system's gradual thermalization, and the\nnonlinearity of the confinement on the experimentally observed dynamics of the\nsystem, thereby facilitating the design of advanced protocols for levitated\noptomechanics."}

In this work, we go beyond these limitations by\nconsidering arbitrary $q$-th excited states $|q\\rangle$, aiming to investigate\ntheir role in preserving quantum resources. We analyze the influence of the\nHawking effect on multipartite quantum states in the Schwarzschild spacetime,\nwith particular attention to quantum entanglement and coherence. Our results\nshow that, under the influence of the Hawking effect, increasing the excitation\nnumber $q$ leads to a reduction in quantum entanglement and mutual information,\nwhile enhancing quantum coherence. This indicates that the Hawking effect on\nexcited multipartite states tends to degrade quantum correlations but\nsimultaneously protects quantum coherence in curved spacetime. Therefore, when\nimplementing quantum information protocols in gravitational settings, reducing\nthe excitation number $q$ is favorable for maintaining entanglement, whereas\nincreasing $q$ may be advantageous for tasks that rely on quantum coherence in\nrelativistic quantum information processing."}

Recent works, however, have revealed\nrobust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains\npinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to\nnon-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system\nwith gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable\nagainst non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this\nrobustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a\nsuppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical\nmechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new\nconnections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin\neffect, opening avenues for experimental realizations."}
