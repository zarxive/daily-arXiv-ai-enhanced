### [1] [The stealth Kerr solution in the bumblebee gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18809)
*Rui Xu,Zhan-Feng Mai,Dicong Liang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该论文展示了库率解伴随一个非平凡矢量场作为矢量引力论中最简单模型(bumblebee模型)的一个解，并通过Newman-Janis算法从一个简单球矢量场生成了这个伴随矢量场，这构成了Schwarzschild度量的一个解，这可能是一个库恩斯定理(DELETE)预测的最早实例之一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Newman-Janis算法的适用性，将简并的球矢量场引伸到更广泛情形，以寻找矢量引力论中的新解。

Method: 利用bumblebee模型和Newman-Janis算法生成解，并计算相关场的性质，如里奇曲率张量。

Result: 发现了新的精确解，展示了该模型在结合矢量场和磁 MOND 理论中的可能性，为矢量引力论提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 该分析表明，在bumblebee模型中，Newman-Janis算法能够有效生成新的施瓦尔西解，表明该理论与广义相对论在类似极简情况下具有相似的黑体解结构。

Abstract: In this paper, we find Kerr solution accompanied with a nontrivial vector field as a solution to one of the simplest vector-tensor theories of gravity, namely the bumblebee model with an intriguing coupling constant between the Ricci curvature tensor and the vector field. We also demonstrate that the accompanied vector field can be generated via the Newman-Janis algorithm from a simple spherical vector field, which together with the Schwarzschild metric constitutes a solution to the same bumblebee model. It is probably the simplest example of a theory and its black-hole solutions for the Newman-Janis algorithm to hold except for general relativity.

Abstract: A new realization of the matter Lagrangian is introduced which models the dark energy component as a non-standard combination of thermodynamics quantities of the baryonic matter. We will prove that the present realization is independent of existing models with matter-geometry couplings and has a property that the energy-momentum tensor of both baryonic matter and dark energy is conserved separately. We further show that two possible choices of the matter Lagrangian in the $Λ$CDM model are not totally equivalent and investigate the background and perturbative constraints on the form of matter Lagrangian. We will also investigate cosmological implications of a test model with logarithmic DE and obtain the model parameters by confronting the model with observational data on the cosmic chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ and $fσ_8$ datasets. We will also explain in details the predictions of the model on the late time behavior of the universe and compare the result with $Λ$CDM model.

### [3] [Reconsidering the consistent use of precessing, higher order multipole models for gravitational wave analyses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18916)
*Charlie Hoy*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Using a more computationally affordable model for Bayesian inference in GW population studies improves efficiency by up to 78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient models are crucial for population studies of black holes using GW data.

Method: Developed a selection criterion to use less accurate but faster models with minimal impact on population parameter estimates.

Result:  Bayesian inference cost reduced by ~20% for worst-case scenarios; up to 78% for astrophysical populations.

Conclusion: This approach allows for more efficient and scalable GW population modeling without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: The growing number of gravitational-wave (GW) observations allows for constraints to be placed on the underlying population of black holes; current estimates show that black hole spins are small, with binaries more likely to have comparable component masses. Since general relativistic effects, such as spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments, are more likely to be observed for asymmetric binary systems, a direct measurement remains unlikely. Nevertheless, we continue to consistently probe these effects by performing Bayesian inference with our most accurate and computationally expensive models. As the number of GW detections increases, it may soon become infeasible to consistently use these models for analyses. In this paper, we provide a selection criterion that determines when less accurate and computationally cheaper models can be used without giving biased estimates for the population properties of black holes in the Universe. We show that when using our selection criterion, comparable estimates can be obtained for the underlying mass and spin distribution of black holes for a simulated "worst-case" scenario population, while reducing the overall cost of performing Bayesian inference on our population by $\sim 20\%$. We anticipate a reduction of up to $78\%$ in the overall cost for an astrophysically motivated population, since there are fewer events with observable spin-precession and higher order multipole power.

### [4] [Inertial-to-Rindler Coordinates, with applications to the Twin Paradox, Radar Time and the Unruh Temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18956)
*Paul M. Alsing*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究者提出了一个两参数变换族，在平坦的莫inkowski时空中，可以平滑地将具有恒定初始/最终速度的惯性坐标系（如常数加速度）与具有恒定加速度的黎内尔坐标系（Rindler坐标）进行匹配。他们重新审视了双胞胎悖论，并说明了新的Inertial-to-Rindler (I2R)坐标系如何支持教科书和文章中讨论的“立即”和“逐渐”转换。此外，他们还研究了Dolby和Gull提出的基于雷达时间的同步面表述方法，分析了从零到均匀加速的坐标变化。最后，他们重新考虑了一个纯粹正频率Minkowski平面波在I2R观察者视角中的负频率成分，并推导出两种情况下的摄动温度校正（初始/最终速度略大于零，或略小于光速），后者描述了恒定加速度运动。研究者还提出了一个基于速度的广义Unruh温度，该温度在零加速时为零，在恒定加速度时还原为标准形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这项研究表明，Inertial-to-Rindler (I2R)变换在平坦莫inkowski时空中为解决双胞胎悖论、分析同步面和研究Unruh效应提供了一个有用的框架。

Method: 研究者使用了广义坐标系变换方法，分析了I2R变换下不同运动状态的物理现象，包括加速和惯性运动的切换、双胞胎悖论的具体情况以及Unruh效应的温度变化。

Result: 这项研究验证了Inertial-to-Rindler变换在惯性与加速度条件下的可行性和应用前景，展示了其在解决经典相对论问题和量子场论中的温度效应方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为解决双胞胎悖论、分析同步面和研究Unruh效应的温度变化提供了一个新的范式，I2R坐标系能够平滑地连接惯性与加速度运动状态，为相关领域的研究开辟了新的视角。

Abstract: In this work we formulate a two-parameter family of transformations in flat Minkowksi spacetime that smoothly interpolates between motion with constant initial/final velocity (inertial coordinates), and with constant acceleration (Rindler coordinates \cite{Rindler:1956}), which we term Inertial-to-Rindler (I2R) coordinates. We revisit the Twin ``Paradox" and show how the new I2R coordinates justify the ``immediate-" and ``gradual-turnaround" scenarios discussed in many texbooks and articles. We also examine the radar time formulation of hypersurfaces of simultaneity by Dolby and Gull \cite{Dolby_Gull:2001} for these new coordinates as we transition from zero to uniform acceleration. Finaly we re-examine the negative frequency content of a purely positive frequency Minkowski plane wave as observed by the I2R observer, and derive perturbative corrections to the Unruh \cite{Unruh:1976} temperature for the two cases of initial/final velocities slightly greater than zero, and slightly less than the speed of light - the latter of which characterizes constant acceleration motion. We argue for a proposed velocity-dependent generalization of the Unruh temperature that smoothly varies from zero at zero-acceleration, to the standard form at constant acceleration.

### [5] [Reconstructing inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of ACT data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18958)
*Ramón Herrera,Carlos Ríos*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper reconstructs background variables in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity using specific observational parameters, finding a relationship between the effective potential and coupling function that differs from previous assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the early universe's inflationary epoch and its gravitational effects is key to exploring cosmological models beyond the standard Einstein framework.

Method: The authors use the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio as variables, employing the effective potential and coupling function in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to analyze the reconstruction method.

Result: The study shows that in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the effective potential and coupling function are interconnected differently than what was previously assumed.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into the evolution of the early universe within modified gravity frameworks, challenging prior assumptions about potential and coupling relationships.

Abstract: During the inflationary epoch, we investigate the reconstruction of the background variables within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, considering the scalar spectral index $n_s(N)$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r(N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of $e-$folds. Under a general formalism, we determine the effective potential and the coupling function associated with the Gauss-Bonnet term as functions of the cosmological parameters $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$, respectively. To implement the reconstruction methodology for the background variables, we study an example in which the attractors for the index $n_s$ and the ratio $r$ are in agreement with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. In this context, explicit expressions for the effective potential $V(φ)$ and the coupling parameter $ξ(φ)$ are reconstructed. Moreover, the reconstruction based on observational parameters shows that $V(φ)\not\propto 1/ξ(φ)$, in contrast to the assumption adopted in the literature for the study of the evolution of the universe in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we revisit a recently reported generalization of the Bañados--Teitelboim--Zanelli black hole arising in New Massive Gravity sourced by the quantum fluctuations of scalar matter, now examined through the lens of a purely classical framework. We show that the same geometry, distinguished by its logarithmic asymptotic structure, emerges as the unique static solution of Einstein gravity coupled to an exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. We trace the origin of this correspondence and prove that this geometry belongs to a unique class of metrics constituting the intersection of the moduli spaces of the static and circularly symmetric sectors of the two theories, thereby revealing a dynamical equivalence between them. An explicit mapping is established between the global charges of the nonlinearly charged black holes and the parameters governing the quantum backreaction in New Massive Gravity, allowing for a natural reinterpretation of the quantum imprints in terms of classical charges. A detailed analysis of the horizon structure of these spacetimes is presented. In addition, the full thermodynamics of the more general configurations is constructed using the Iyer--Wald formalism, from which we derive the first law and the associated Smarr relation. Altogether, our results provide a classical realization of a semiclassical spacetime and point toward a broader correspondence between higher-curvature corrections in quantum gravity and nonlinear effects in self-gravitating electrodynamics in three dimensions.

### [7] [Spiral Density Waves and Torque Balance in the Kerr Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19123)
*Conor Dyson,Daniel J. D'Orazio*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in relativistic accretion discs and their implications for the LISA mission. The study reveals that existing disc-EMRI interaction models are inadequate as they fail to account for the relativistic fluid response. The paper provides a relativistic calculation using techniques from self-force theory and black hole perturbation theory, incorporating relativistic effects and fluid dynamics. The authors derive a torque-balance equation, facilitating the understanding of torque interactions in such systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of models predicting interactions between massive objects and stellar matter in relativistic environments, especially those relevant for future space-based gravitational wave missions like LISA. By incorporating relativistic fluid dynamics, the paper aims to enhance prediction capabilities for phenomena such as spiral arm structure and angular momentum transport in accretion discs. The ultimate goal is to better understand the physics of EMRI systems and improve associated gravitational wave astronomy efforts.

Method: The paper employs methods from self-force theory, black hole perturbation theory, and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. They utilize a master enthalpy-like variable and linearized fluid theory to compute fluid perturbations and analyze spiral arm structures in different spin scenarios within Kerr geometry.

Result: The authors successfully calculate the relativistic fluid response to EMRI perturbations, including pressure effects. They identify a relativistic torque-balance equation that connects the local torques and angular momentum fluxes in the disc. This result provides a theoretical framework for studying the torque interactions between EMRI objects and surrounding matter, contributing to a deeper understanding of accretion disc physics in relativistic settings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that relativistic effects significantly influence the dynamics of EMRI discs. By deriving a precise torque-balance equation, the paper offers a novel tool for analyzing the interplay between gravitational forces on EMRI objects and the surrounding relativistic accretion disc. This work paves the way for more accurate modeling of EMRI systems, enhancing strategies for utilizing LISA and similar missions for gravitational wave astronomy and astrophysical research.

Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in relativistic accretion discs are a key science target for the upcoming LISA mission. Existing models of disc-EMRI interactions typically rely on crude dynamical friction or Newtonian planetary migration prescriptions, which fail to capture the relativistic fluid response induced by the binary potential. In this work we address this gap by providing the relativistic calculation. We apply standard methods from self-force theory, black hole perturbation theory, and relativistic stellar perturbation theory to perform the full fluid calculation of the relativistic analogue of planetary migration for the first time. We calculate the response of a fluid in the perturbing potential of an EMRI consistently incorporating pressure effects. Using a master enthalpy-like variable and linearised fluid theory, we reconstruct the fluid perturbations and relativistic spiral arm structure for a range of spin values in the Kerr geometry. We conclude by deriving a relativistic torque-balance equation that enables computation and comparison of local torques with advected angular momentum through the disc. This opens a promising route towards establishing torque-balance relations between integrated disc torques arising from fluid perturbations and the forces acting on EMRIs embedded in matter.

### [8] [Wheeler-DeWitt Equation for Black Hole Interiors in Asymptotically Safe Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19227)
*Takamasa Kanai*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究中，利用渐近安全性引力中带尺度依赖的引力常数的哈密顿方程分析了韦尔-德威特方程。结果显示，尽管牛顿常数显式依赖于尺度，但经典解不受这一依赖影响。

Motivation: 研究渐近安全性引力中的尺度依赖性对韦尔-德威特方程的影响，旨在探讨引力常数变化如何影响宇宙解的发展。

Method: 通过构建具有尺度依赖性引力耦合的哈密顿方程，并在超空间中求解，我们分析了引力常数的尺度依赖对韦尔-德威特方程解的影响。

Result: 首先，在经典极限中，虽然场的尺度依赖性不影响解的基本行为，但有关量子行为在紫外极限抑制了奇点的形成。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论：尺度依赖性仅在量子层面影响韦尔-德威特方程的解，而经典解不受显著影响。

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with scale-dependent gravitational couplings within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. In the Hamiltonian formulation based on a renormalization-group improved Einstein-Hilbert action, the consistency of the theory and the Poisson algebra of constraints have been clarified. Within this framework, we show that, despite the explicit scale dependence of Newton's constant, the classical solutions are generically unaffected by the running of the coupling.
  We then derive the Wheeler-DeWitt equation incorporating the scale dependence of the gravitational couplings and analyze its solutions in the minisuperspace framework. In the classical limit, while the scale dependence of Newton's constant does not affect the classical behavior, the running of the cosmological constant can contribute to the classical solutions. Moreover, we show that the quantum behavior in the ultraviolet regime acts toward suppressing singularity formation in all cases, independently of how the renormalization-group scale is identified with spacetime coordinates and of the relative magnitudes of the ultraviolet fixed points of the running Newton's constant and cosmological constant.

### [9] [Absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves by Frolov black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19364)
*Jining Tang,Yang Huang,Hongsheng Zhang*

TL;DR: 研究了无质量标量波动在弗罗洛夫黑洞中的吸收和散射，对比了弗罗洛夫、罗森机制和霍华德黑洞的吸积和散射模式，发现当它们的临界冲击参数或 glory 冲击参数相匹配时，吸积和散射模式几乎无法区分，说明光球几何对标量场相互作用主导，细节核心结构起次级作用。

Motivation: 研究黑洞周围的无质量标量波动具有重要意义，可以帮助我们理解黑洞的吸积和散射特性，以及如何通过波场探测来检验黑洞的可观察性。

Result: 数值结果显示吸积截面随正则化参数增加而增加，与无量纲质量的变化一致；对比不同黑洞的吸积和散射模式，发现当它们的临界冲击参数或 glory 冲击参数相匹配时，吸积和散射模式几乎无法区分，说明光球几何对标量场相互作用主导，细节核心结构次之。

Conclusion: 通过波场探测，可以测试正则黑洞几何及其可观察效应。光球几何对标量场相互作用至关重要，细节结构的作用更有限。

Abstract: We comprehensively investigate the absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves by Frolov black holes, which is a class of regularization of the Reissner--Nordström spacetime. By analyzing the null geodesics, we determine the photon sphere radius and the critical impact parameter, deriving the geometric capture cross section and the classical differential scattering cross section. Utilizing the partial-wave method, we numerically compute the absorption and scattering cross sections across a broad frequency range. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with the low-frequency limit and the high-frequency sinc approximation, as well as with the semiclassical glory approximation. We analyze the dependence of the spectra on the charge and the regularization parameter (Hubble length). Under the horizon-radius normalization, we observe that the total absorption cross section increases with the regularization parameter, a behavior we attribute to the variation of the dimensionless mass. Furthermore, by comparing Frolov, Reissner--Nordström, and Hayward black holes, we demonstrate that their absorption and scattering patterns are nearly indistinguishable when their critical impact parameters or glory impact parameters are matched. This indicates that the photon sphere geometry predominantly governs scalar field interactions, while the detailed core structure plays a secondary role. Our work underscores the potential of wave-based probes to test regular black hole geometries and their observable imprints.

### [10] [Atomic clocks and gravitational waves as probes of non-metricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19407)
*Mohsen Khodadi,Emmanuel N. Saridakis*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Non-metricity in Weyl geometry can be probed using atomic clocks and gravitational waves. The Weyl field's path-dependent effects influence the transport of length, and its dynamical effects contribute to an anomalous strain in gravitational waves, which could explain current observations without deviations from General Relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the experimental signatures of non-metricity using advanced tools like atomic clocks and gravitational waves, suggesting potential inconsistencies with General Relativity.

Method: The authors employ Weyl geometry, explore observable effects through gauge-invariant formulation, and use atomic-clock experiments to derive constraints. They analyze the Weyl field's contribution to gravitational waves.

Result: The study proposes observable effects of non-metricity, linking them to existing experimental results. The findings suggest that deviations from General Relativity are constrained, as the induction of an anomalous strain could explain current observations without GR anomalies.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical framework for testing non-metric theories of gravity using existing and near-future experiments, potentially offering a new approach to understanding spacetime beyond Einstein's theory.

Abstract: Non-metricity provides a natural extension of Riemannian geometry, yet its experimental signatures remain largely unexplored. In this work we investigate how spacetime non-metricity can be probed through high-precision observations, focusing on atomic clocks and gravitational waves as complementary tools. Working within Weyl geometry as a minimal realization of vectorial non-metricity, we formulate observable effects in a gauge-invariant manner and show that they are associated with path-dependent length transport governed by the Weyl field strength. We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain. As a result, the absence of deviations from General Relativity in current gravitational-wave observations already places meaningful and strong constraints on dynamical non-metric degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The simplest approach to include a mass into the electromagnetic vector potential is to modify the Einstein-Maxwell action to the Einstein-Proca form. There are currently no exact analytical solutions for this scenario. However, by using perturbation theory, where both the Proca mass and the black hole charge are small parameters, it is possible to find an exact analytical solution. In this solution, the metric tensor remains unchanged, but the vector potential deviates from the Coulomb potential. In particular, even if the Proca mass is limited by the value $m_γ<10^{-48}\text{g}$, which is the current experimental upper limit for photon mass, it makes a significant contribution to the dynamical equations. In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and charged particles in the vicinity of a weakly Proca-charged black hole, and test the observational implications of the solution of the Einstein-Proca equations for gravitational bending, the black hole shadow, and the fit to the orbits of the Galactic center flares observed by the near-infrared GRAVITY instrument. We find that only extremely cold photons, which are likely scattered before reaching a distant observer, could reveal the non-zero photon mass effect through the black hole shadow. For the Galactic center flare analysis we obtained constraints on the dimensionless Proca parameter to $μ\leq 0.125$ for the electric interaction parameter in the range $-1.1 < \mathrm{Q} < 0.5$, which can be potentially tested by future GRAVITY flare astrometry. Since the Proca parameter is coupled to the black hole mass, the effect of the Proca charge becomes more pronounced for supermassive black holes compared to stellar-mass objects. Our perturbative treatment remains valid essentially up to the horizon, with divergences appearing only in the immediate near-horizon region, where a fully non-perturbative analysis would be required.

### [12] [The diffusion equation is compatible with special relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19464)
*Lorenzo Gavassino*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study suggests that the diffusion equation, which appears to contradict special relativity, can be reconciled within a relativistic kinetic theory framework through the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. Solutions to the diffusion equation are valid when viewed as parts of a larger kinetic theory without implications for causality or stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between diffusion processes and relativistic theories is crucial for fields ranging from physics to applied mathematics, particularly in contexts where diffusion plays a significant role while maintaining relativistic invariance.

Method: The authors formulate a relativistic kinetic theory using the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation and compare its hydrodynamic solutions to those of the diffusion equation, demonstrating consistency without relativistic contradictions.

Result: The study conclusively shows that the diffusion equation's characteristics are fully compatible with special relativity when embedded within a kinetic framework.

Conclusion: The findings resolve long-standing issues about the relativistic nature of diffusion processes, affirming the existence of a consistent and causal relativistic kinetic theory that aligns with diffusion dynamics.

Abstract: Due to its parabolic character, the diffusion equation exhibits instantaneous spatial spreading, and becomes unstable when Lorentz-boosted. According to the conventional interpretation, these features reflect a fundamental incompatibility with special relativity. In this Letter, we show that this interpretation is incorrect by demonstrating that any smooth and sufficiently localized solution of the diffusion equation is the particle density of an exact solution of the relativistic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. This establishes the existence of a causal, stable, and thermodynamically consistent relativistic kinetic theory whose hydrodynamic sector is governed exactly by diffusion at all wavelengths. We further demonstrate that the standard arguments for instability arise from considering solutions that admit no counterpart in kinetic theory, and that apparent violations of causality disappear once signals are defined in terms of the underlying microscopic data.

Abstract: In General Relativity, there exist two objects of limiting compactness, one with a null boundary defining the horizon of a black hole and the other with a timelike boundary defining a Buchdahl star. The two are characterized by gravitational energy equal to or half the mass. Since non-gravitational mass-energy is the source of gravitational energy, both of these objects are manifestly stable. We demonstrate in this letter, in a simple and general way, that the equilibrium state defining the object is indeed stable, independent of the nature of the perturbation.

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays' hint for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) leverages the expectations of a future detection in the millihertz band, particularly with the LISA space mission. However, finding an SGWB with a single orbiting detector is challenging: It calls for cautious modelling of instrumental noise, which is also mainly stochastic. It was shown that agnostic noise reconstruction methods provide robustness in the detection process. We build on previous work to include more realistic instrumental simulations and additional degrees of freedom in the noise inference model and analyze the impact of LISA's sensitivity to SGWBs. Particularly, we model the two main types of noise sources with separate transfer functions and power spectral density spline fitting. We assess the detectability bounds and their dependence on the flexibility of the noise model and on the prior probability, allowing us to refine previously reported results.

### [15] [Comment on "Multidimensional arrow of time" (arXiv:2601.14134)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19819)
*Andrei Galiautdinov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper suggests that the arrow of time in the universe might be linked to the expansion of extra dimensions, but there’s a problem because this would change Newton’s gravitational constant too much, conflicting with observations. To solve this, the author proposes a new idea called the 'shape-dynamic arrow of time,' using a concept from geometry called Perelman’s nu-entropy to explain how the extra dimensions could evolve without changing Newton’s constant too much.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of time's arrow is a fundamental question in physics. If time’s arrow is related to the expansion of the universe, especially extra dimensions, this could help explain why the universe is the way it is. But there are challenges, like the problem with Newton’s gravitational constant, which needs to be addressed.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis in their preprint, considering concepts from extra dimensions in Kaluza-Klein theories, the behavior of geometric quantities like Ricci flow, and entropy measures in geometry. They also look at observational data, like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and Lunar Laser Ranging, to check if their ideas make sense.

Result: The authors find that while the current ideas about the arrow of time tying it to expanding extra dimensions have potential, there’s an issue with Newton’s constant varying too much. They introduce the new 'shape-dynamic' concept using Perelman’s nu-entropy as a solution to this problem, which maintains the key idea but adjusts the geometry to keep Newton’s constant in check.

Conclusion: Even though the author makes a good case for how time’s arrow might work in theories with extra dimensions, the main problem remains the variation in Newton’s constant. The author’s new idea helps fix this, but more research is needed to see if it works in practice and fits all the observations.

Abstract: In a recent preprint [arXiv:2601.14134v1], Rubin argues that the arrow of time originates from the monotonic growth of the volume of extra dimensions. While the identification of a geometric origin for time's arrow is compelling in the case of brane-world models, we point out a possible tension between the proposed volume growth and the observational stability of the effective four-dimensional Newton's gravitational constant, G, that may arise in Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory. In standard KK approaches, such volume growth induces a time-variation of G that exceeds Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) bounds by many orders of magnitude. To resolve this tension while preserving the author's key insight in the Kaluza-Klein case, we propose an extension: the "shape-dynamic arrow of time". By utilizing the scale-invariant monotonicity of Perelman's nu-entropy under normalized Ricci flow, we demonstrate how an arrow of time can emerge from the geometric smoothing of extra dimensions at fixed volume, thereby satisfying observational constraints on fundamental constants.

Abstract: Recently, a novel dictionary relating solutions of the Einstein--Scalar--Maxwell theory to solutions of gauged Skyrme--Maxwell--Einstein models in $(3+1)$ dimensions has been established. This development provides a clear and systematic route to constructing new configurations with nontrivial Baryonic charge and magnetic field, leveraging the fact that the Einstein--Scalar--Maxwell system is considerably more tractable, thanks to powerful solution-generating techniques. In this work, we exploit the framework that allows compact sources dressed by scalar fields to be consistently embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds, and we construct their dual counterparts carrying Baryonic charge in the Skyrme sector. The resulting Baryonic charge is expressed directly in terms of the parameters characterizing the seed spacetime, and a corresponding quantization condition involving these parameters is explicitly derived. Consequently, the mass and the Baryonic charge are not independent parameters. These results provide a closed analytic formula for the black hole mass parameter in terms of the Baryonic charge and the magnetic field. This relation between the mass parameter and the Baryonic charge is linear for large values of the mass, while significant deviations from linearity arise if the mass takes intermediate values.

Abstract: We show how several important classical problems, with positive definite potential energy, can be solved by starting from the factorization of the total mechanical energy using complex numbers. In particular, we derive in a new way exact analytical solutions for: simple harmonic oscillator, vertical projectile motion, motion under a repulsive inverse cube force, and damped harmonic oscillator (with linear damping). We also show how this approach easily yields an excellent approximation of the energy decay and a new approximate analytical solution in the case of a weakly damped harmonic oscillator. Our derivations are suitable for undergraduate physics teaching as an alternative to solving Newton's equations of motion. In addition, we comment on the limitations of our approach, but also on the insights it provides and opportunities for further research.

Abstract: This paper argues that several canonical puzzles in quantum mechanics, including spin measurement, the double slit, entanglement correlations, and Wigner's friend, share a common origin in a semantic error and the illicit promotion of interaction conditional outcomes to intrinsic properties. I introduce four principles that license only configuration relative predication, grounding outcomes in physical measurement geometry while preserving objectivity. Applying these principles uniformly dissolves each puzzle without new physics or ad hoc interpretive machinery. Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker theorem are reframed not as dynamical mysteries but as constraints on permissible explanatory structure, evidence that intrinsic-outcome semantics is incompatible with empirical reality. The result is a relational objectivity that avoids both naive property realism and observer subjectivism.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising methods for solving combinatorial optimization problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, benchmarking VQAs is difficult due to their stochastic behavior and the lack of standardized performance criteria. This work introduces a general framework for evaluating VQAs applied to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. The framework uses three complementary metrics: feasibility, quality, and reproducibility. It also introduces a quality diagram that visualizes trade-offs between success probability and computational resources. Reproducibility is formalized using Shannon entropy, and a decision rule is defined for selecting algorithms under resource constraints. As a demonstration, the framework is applied to several VQAs using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) cost functions and different shot counts on a 16-qubit QUBO instance. The results show how the framework supports systematic benchmarking and provides a foundation for adaptive algorithm selection in hybrid quantum-classical workflows.

Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the cornerstone imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery stenosis and guiding interventional decision-making. However, interpretation based on single-frame angiographic images remains highly operator-dependent, and conventional deep learning models still face challenges in modeling complex vascular morphology and fine-grained texture patterns.Methods: We propose a Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet (LQER) for binary classification of coronary angiography images. A pretrained ResNet18 is employed as a classical feature extractor, while a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is introduced at the high-level semantic feature space for quantum feature enhancement. The quantum module utilizes data re-uploading and entanglement structures, followed by residual fusion with classical features, enabling end-to-end hybrid optimization with a strictly controlled number of qubits.Results: On an independent test set, the proposed LQER outperformed the classical ResNet18 baseline in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, achieving a test accuracy exceeding 90%. The results demonstrate that lightweight quantum feature enhancement improves discrimination of positive lesions, particularly under class-imbalanced conditions.Conclusion: This study validates a practical hybrid quantum--classical learning paradigm for coronary angiography analysis, providing a feasible pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in medical imaging applications.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个信息回流相图方法，统一了量子纠缠回复和经典熵超影现象，通过共同的回流函数NI=∫_{eingating}dotI dt来比较它们的‘回流阶段’。在这项工作中，我们首先提出了一个信息回流相图方法，将量子纠缠回复和经典熵超影现象放在同一平台上进行比较。我们通过这个方法，发现了两个现象的边界线不同，量子现象在α≈1/2时发生明显的相变。研究还揭示了记忆核的数学结构是导致这种现象的关键因素。总之，这项研究提供了一种统一的方法，可以用于分类非马尔可夫性，并通过信息回流相图来解释现象。


<details>

Motivation: 研究者们一直在试图理解非马尔科夫性，但其复杂性使得量化和分类变得困难。而该研究通过引入信息回流相图方法，提供了一种新的视角来分析非马尔科夫现象，尤其在量子与经典体系中。这种方法在量子与经典体系中都适用，具有普适性，有助于更深入地理解非马尔科夫性的本质。

Result: 研究发现，在α≈1/2时，量子与经典的回流相图表现出不同的行为，量子系统在α=0.5附近发生显著的相变。此外，通过引入分数阶Mittag–Leffler记忆核，研究者发现相图的边界主要取决于记忆核的数学结构，而不是量子性本身。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一种统一的方法，可以通过信息回流相图来分析和理解非马尔科夫性，无论是量子体系还是经典体系。这种方法在揭示量子与经典之间的联系方面具有重要意义，并且可以在更广泛的体系中应用。

Abstract: Memory effects in non-Markovian dynamics are often diagnosed either via quantum-correlation revivals or via non-monotonic classical information measures, yet a unified minimal framework comparing their ``backflow phases'' is still lacking. Here we propose an information-backflow phase-diagram approach that places \emph{quantum entanglement revivals} and \emph{classical entropy overshoots} on the same footing through a common backflow functional $N_I=\int_{\dot I>0}\dot I\,dt$. On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(α)}_{qe}(t)=\frac14[E_α(-λ^αt^α)]^2\sin^2(ωt)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $α\simeq 1/2$ in the $(α,ω/λ)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $ΔH$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex. To strengthen the quantum--classical symmetry, we further introduce a \emph{fractional Mittag--Leffler memory kernel} in the classical dynamics and show that an analogous backflow transition emerges around $α\simeq 1/2$, indicating that the boundary originates from the kernel's mathematical structure rather than from quantumness per se. Overall, our results provide a compact, model-agnostic route to classify non-Markovianity by phase diagrams of information backflow and to interpret them via a shared embedding narrative: memory stored in hidden degrees of freedom returns to the observed sector as non-monotonic information flow.

### [22] [Feshbach-Villars Hamiltonian Approach to the Klein-Gordon Oscillator and Supercritical Step Scattering in Standard and Generalized Doubly Special Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18836)
*A. Boumali,N. Jafari,Y. Chargui*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a Feshbach-Villars Hamiltonian framework for spin-0 relativistic quantum dynamics under Planck-scale kinematic deformations. It derives a modified dispersion relation, constructs a pseudo-Hermitian two-component Hamiltonian, and applies the model to a Klein-Gordon oscillator and scattering problems, comparing different deformation realizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating Planck-scale effects on relativistic quantum systems is crucial. FV frameworks are standard for such studies, and deriving their consequences under deformations could inform quantum gravity effects.

Method: Starts with a nonlinear momentum map, derives MDR, linearizes Klein-Gordon, constructs Hamiltonian, and applies to oscillator and scattering scenarios.

Result: Obtains controlled spectral shifts, reveals deformation impacts on level spacing and supercritical thresholds, and compares two deformation types.

Conclusion: Extends FV framework to deformed scenarios, provides tools for studying Planck-scale effects in quantum dynamics.

Abstract: We develop a first-order Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian framework for spin-0 relativistic quantum dynamics in the presence of Planck-scale kinematic deformations described within generalized doubly special relativity (G-DSR). Starting from a generic nonlinear momentum-space map, we derive the corresponding modified dispersion relation (MDR) at leading order in the Planck length \(l_p\) and construct a consistent FV linearization of the deformed Klein-Gordon operator. The resulting two-component Hamiltonian remains \(σ_3\)-pseudo-Hermitian at \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\), which guarantees conservation of the FV charge and current and provides a current-based definition of reflection and transmission in stationary scattering.
  As applications, we study two benchmark settings in which the FV metric structure is essential: (i) the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator and (ii) scattering from electrostatic step and barrier potentials. For the oscillator, we obtain controlled \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\) branch-resolved spectral shifts and show how kinetic versus mass-shell deformations reshape the level spacing and the high-energy spectral compression. For step and barrier scattering, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients directly from the pseudo-Hermitian FV current and quantify the deformation-induced shift of the supercritical (pair-production) threshold. A comparative analysis of the Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin realizations indicates that MS-type deformations generally delay the onset of the supercritical regime and reduce the magnitude of the negative transmitted flux within the validity domain \(l_p E \ll 1\).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the fermionic sign problem make simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems challenging. This work addresses these challenges through a quantum simulation framework.

Method: A digital quantum simulation framework is developed, which includes a unified Hamiltonian formalism using the Jordan-Wigner transformation to map the system onto a gate-based quantum processor. A first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition is used to implement a Ramsey interferometry protocol for extracting real-time dynamics and spectral response.

Result: The simulation successfully captures the smooth transition from a dressed quasiparticle regime to a stable molecular bound state, with linear energy renormalization in the strong-coupling limit. The framework is validated against exact classical benchmarks and executed on quantum hardware with resilience to noise.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust method for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems on quantum hardware, demonstrating the potential of digital quantum simulation approaches.

Abstract: The simulation of strongly correlated fermionic systems remains one of the most significant challenges in computational physics due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the fermionic sign problem. In this work, we present a digital quantum simulation framework to explore the Fermi polaron and the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover. We develop a unified Hamiltonian formalism that bridges pairing superfluidity and impurity physics, mapping the system onto a gate-based quantum processor via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Using a first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, we implement a Ramsey interferometry protocol to extract the real-time dynamics and spectral response of the system.
  Our results demonstrate a smooth transition from a dressed quasiparticle (polaron) regime to a stable molecular bound state, characterized by a linear energy renormalization in the strong-coupling limit. We validate our simulation against exact classical benchmarks and report successful execution on the Barcelona Supercomputing Center quantum hardware. Despite the inherent noise of the quantum hardware, the hybrid variational approach shows remarkable resilience, accurately capturing the bifurcation of the spectral density

Abstract: Relativistic spin effects drive subtle molecular phenomena ranging from intersystem crossing in photodynamic therapy to spin-mediated catalysis and high-resolution spectroscopy. These effects are described by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian, which extends the nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian by including one- and two-electron spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions. First-principles simulations of the full Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian rapidly become intractable on classical computers due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the complexity of two-body spin-dependent terms. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing molecular energy levels and properties governed by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian. Our approach block-encodes the relativistic Hamiltonian in a second-quantized, doubly factorized representation. By reformulating the Hamiltonian in a symmetry-adapted Majorana basis, we construct efficient linear-combination-of-unitaries circuits that encode spin-orbit interactions without effective or mean-field approximations. We introduce spin-controlled Pauli-SWAP networks that decouple spin and orbital control logic, enabling a unified treatment of relativistic spin mixing with only modest overhead relative to spin-free simulations. We analyze quantum resources in terms of logical qubits and T-gate complexity, showing that explicit spin degrees of freedom do not worsen the asymptotic scaling. The prefactor is reduced by a factor of two compared to direct linear-combination-of-unitaries approaches. Finally, we outline a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for designing photodynamic therapy photosensitizers, artificial photosynthesis catalysts, and other systems where accurate relativistic spin effects are essential.

Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research. Throughout, we highlight experimental implementations that exemplify the increasing role of reinforcement learning in shaping the development of quantum technologies.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The preferred-basis problem and the definite-outcome aspect of the measurement problem persist even if the detector is modeled unitarily, because experimental data are necessarily represented in a Boolean event algebra of mutually exclusive records whereas the theoretical description is naturally formulated in a noncommutative operator algebra with continuous unitary symmetry. This change of mathematical type constitutes the core of the 'cut': a structurally necessary interface from group-based kinematics to set-based counting. In the presented view the basis relevant for recorded outcomes is not determined by the system Hamiltonian alone; it is induced by the measurement mapping, i.e., by the detector channel together with the coarse-grained readout that defines an instrument. The probabilistic mapping is anchored in symmetry and measure theory: by Gleason-type uniqueness (Gleason for projections in $d>2$ and Busch's extension for Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) including $d=2$), the trace rule is the unique probability measure consistent with additivity over exclusive events and basis-independence of the unitary sector. A compact qubit--pointer model yields an induced unsharp POVM $E_\pm=\tfrac12(\id\pm η\,σ_z)$ with $η$ fixed by pointer resolution, displaying explicitly how the detector induces the relevant basis. Finally, nested-observer paradoxes are tightened into a non-composability lemma: joint assignment of outcome propositions is obstructed unless a joint instrument exists. This relocates the origin of randomness to the stochasticity of the transition rules.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate precision limitations in spectrophotometry (i.e., spectroscopic concentration measurements) imposed by chemical processes of molecules. Using the recently developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory, which generalizes Maxwell-Bloch theory for higher-order measurement statistics, we analyze a molecular model system subject to chemical reactions whose electronic and optical properties depend on the chemical state. Analysis of sensitivity bounds reveals: (i) Phase measurements are more sensitive than intensity measurements; (ii) Sensitivity exhibits three regimes: photon-shot-noise limited, chemically limited, and intermediate; (iii) Sensitivity shows a turnover as a function of reaction rate due to the interplay between coherent electronic dynamics and incoherent chemical dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that chemical properties must be considered to estimate ultimate precision limits in optical spectrophotometry.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The applicability and performance of qubits dressed by classical fields are limited because their control protocols give rise to an undesired counter-rotating term (CRT). This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce post-selection games, a generalization of nonlocal games where each round can be not only won or lost by the players, but also discarded by the referee. Such games naturally formalize possibilistic proofs of nonlocality, such as Hardy's paradox. We develop algorithms for computing the local and Tsirelson bounds of post-selection games. Furthermore, we show that they have an unbounded advantage in statistical power over traditional nonlocal games, making them ideally suited for analysing Bell tests with low detection efficiency.

Abstract: The performance of tensor network methods has seen constant improvements over the last few years. We add to this effort by introducing a new algorithm that efficiently applies tree tensor network operators to tree tensor network states inspired by the density matrix method and the Cholesky decomposition. This application procedure is a common subroutine in tensor network methods. We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator.

Abstract: Random quantum states drawn from the Haar ensemble with a constraint on the energy expectation value $E_{\mathrm{av}} = \langle ψ| H | ψ\rangle$ display \textit{eigenstate condensation}: for $E_{\mathrm{av}}$ below a critical value $E_c$, they develop macroscopic overlap with the ground state. We study eigenstate condensation in systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These systems display three phases: a ground-state phase, in which energy-constrained random states have macroscopic overlap with the ground state; a high-temperature phase, in which they have exponentially small overlap with each energy eigenstate; and an anti-ground-state phase, in which they have macroscopic overlap with the most highly excited state. In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase.

Abstract: The canonical commutation relation is a cornerstone of quantum theory and underlies the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Although uncertainty relations have been extensively tested, direct verifications of the underlying commutation relation itself have remained elusive. We report an experimental demonstration of the bosonic commutation relation for optical field operators based on measurements of two distinct intensity correlation functions. From these measurements, we extract the expectation value of the field-operator commutator for both a single-photon state and coherent state. In both cases, the measured values are consistent with unity, in quantitative agreement with quantum theory.

Abstract: The state $ρ$ of a quantum system can be represented by a vector $\mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{M}}(ρ)$ of outcome probabilities for a set of measurements $\mathcal{M}$. Such representations appear throughout physics, for example, in quantum field theory via correlation functions and in quantum foundations within generalized probabilistic frameworks. In this work, we identify an unavoidable tension: to enable operationally meaningful statements, the map ${ρ\mapsto \mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{M}}(ρ)}$ must be topologically robust $\unicode{x2013}$ preserving the notion of closeness between states. Yet, a probability representation that is topologically robust cannot simultaneously retain other essential structure, such as the subsystem structure.

Abstract: We introduce multivariate multicycle (MM) codes, a new family of quantum error correcting codes that unifies and generalizes bivariate bicycle codes, multivariate bicycle codes, abelian two-block group algebra codes, generalized bicycle codes, trivariate tricycle codes, and n-dimensional toric codes. MM codes are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes defined from length-t chain complexes with $t \ge 4$. The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$. Notably, our codes achieve confinement profiles that surpass all known single-shot decodable quantum CSS codes of practical blocksize.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.

Abstract: We compare Krylov's state complexity with an information-geometric (IG) measure of complexity for the quantum evolution of two-level systems. Focusing on qubit dynamics on the Bloch sphere, we analyze evolutions generated by stationary and nonstationary Hamiltonians, corresponding to geodesic and nongeodesic trajectories. We formulate Krylov complexity in geometric terms, both instantaneously and in a time-averaged sense, and contrast it with an IG complexity of quantum evolutions characterized in terms of efficiency and curvature. We show that the two measures reflect fundamentally different aspects of quantum dynamics: Krylov's state complexity quantifies the directional spread of the evolving state relative to the initial state, whereas the IG complexity captures the effective volume explored along the trajectory on the Bloch sphere. This geometric distinction explains their inequivalent behavior and highlights the complementary nature of state-based and information-geometric notions of complexity in quantum systems.

Abstract: Wigner distributions play a significant role in formulating the phase space analogue of quantum mechanics. The Schrodinger wave-functional for solitons is needed to derive it for solitons. The Wigner distribution derived can further be used for calculating the charge distributions, current densities and wave function amplitude in position or momentum space. It can be also used to calculate the upper bound of the quantum speed limit time. We derive and analyze the Wigner distributions for Kink and Sine-Gordon solitons by evaluating the Schrodinger wave-functional for both solitons. The charge, current density, and quantum speed limit for solitons are also discussed which we obtain from the derived analytical expression of Wigner distributions.

Abstract: Traditionally, Quantum Information, and Quantum Communication specifically, have been focused on qubit-based architectures. Recent results, however, highlighted that higher dimensional architectures (qudit-based) may present advantages both in terms of communication and computation; a family of channels called Multi-level Amplitude Damping (MAD) channels, which are a possible qudit generalization of the well known Amplitude Damping Channels, is able to model energy decay processes that may happen during signal transmission. In this work, the Quantum Capacity of 4-dimensional MAD's is studied, relying on a technique for computing it even outside of degradable and antidegradable conditions. We also characterized the complete region of antidegradability and degradability in the parameter space for a generic d-dimensional MAD using both analytical and semi-numerical methods.

Abstract: Position verification schemes are interactive protocols where entities prove their physical location to others; this enables interactive proofs for statements of the form "I am at a location $L$." Although secure position verification cannot be achieved with classical protocols (even with computational assumptions), they are feasible with quantum protocols.
  In this paper we introduce the notion of zero-knowledge position verification, which generalizes position verification in two ways:
  1. enabling entities to prove more sophisticated statements about their locations at different times (for example, "I was NOT near location $L$ at noon yesterday").
  2. maintaining privacy for any other detail about their true location besides the statement they are proving.
  We construct zero-knowledge position verification from standard position verification and post-quantum one-way functions. The central tool in our construction is a primitive we call position commitments, which allow entities to privately commit to their physical position in a particular moment, which is then revealed at some later time.

Abstract: We propose a scheme for accumulating entanglement between long-lived qudits provided by central nuclear spins of defect centers. Assuming a generic setting, the electron spin of each node acts as the communication qubit and may be entangled with other nodes, e.g., through a spin-photon interface. The generally available Ising component of the hyperfine interaction is shown to facilitate repeated entanglement transfer onto memory qudits of arbitrary dimension $d\le 2I+1$ with $I$ the nuclear spin quantum number. When $d$ is set to an integer power of two, maximal entanglement can be generated deterministically and without intermittent driving of nuclear spins. The scheme is applicable to several candidate systems, including the $^{73}$Ge germanium vacancy in diamond.

Motivation: Understanding quantum entanglement through global geometric concepts and vector bundle theory.

Method: Uses Coordinate-free geometry, linear algebraic topology, and categorical constructions to analyze entanglement in gapped systems and symmetry-protected topological states.

Conclusion: Compounds of entanglement can be uniquely constructed in such systems, demonstrated in translation-ally invariant spin chains via string-like braiding moves of Wilson lines with intrinsic structure over a very general base manifold.

Abstract: This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.
  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.
  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.

Abstract: Accurate quantum state readout is crucial for error correction and algorithms, but measurement errors are detrimental. Readout fidelity is typically limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and energy relaxation ($T_1$ decay), a significant problem for superconducting qubits. While most approaches classify results using clustering algorithms on integrated readout signals, these methods cannot distinguish a qubit that was initially in the ground state from one that decayed to it during measurement. We instead propose using machine learning (ML) on the raw, non-integrated analog signal. We apply time-series classification models, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to the full data trajectory. We find that our LSTM model, combined with filtering and feature engineering, consistently outperforms clustering. The largest improvements come from reclassifying points in the boundary regions between clusters. These points correspond to atypical measurement records, likely due to transient or noisy features lost during data integration. By retaining temporal information, sequence-aware models like LSTMs can better discriminate these trajectories, whereas clustering methods based on integrated values are more prone to misclassification.

Abstract: We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for ATP/metaphosphate hydrolysis, one of the most important reactions in all of biology with implications for metabolism, cellular signaling, and cancer therapeutics. In particular, we consider three algorithms for solving the ground state energy estimation problem: the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum Krylov, and quantum phase estimation. By utilizing exact classical simulation, numerical estimation, and analytical bounds, we provide a current and future outlook for using quantum computers to solve impactful biochemical and biological problems. Our results show that variational methods, while being the most heuristic, still require substantially fewer overall resources on quantum hardware, and could feasibly address such problems on current or near-future devices. We include our complete dataset of biomolecular Hamiltonians and code as benchmarks to improve upon with future techniques.

Abstract: Using the framework of decoherent histories, we study which past events leave detectable records in isolated quantum systems under the realistic assumption that decoherence is approximate and not perfect. In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a "branch selection problem", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.

Abstract: To address the discrimination problem of binary phase-shift keyed displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK), this paper proposes an Inverse-squeezing Kennedy (IS-Kennedy) receiver. This architecture incorporates an inverse-squeezing operator following the displacement operation of a conventional Kennedy receiver, mapping the S-BPSK signals onto equivalent large-amplitude coherent states. Furthermore, it employs a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector to perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision-making. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under ideal conditions, the IS-Kennedy receiver effectively translates the transmitter's squeezing resources into a displacement gain at the receiver. Consequently, its error probability approaches the Helstrom bound across the entire energy spectrum, remaining within a constant factor of 3 dB. In the low-photon-number regime ($N \approx 0.6$), the proposed scheme surpasses the coherent-state limit, achieving an error rate below 1\%. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of system performance under non-ideal conditions, revealing the robustness of PNR detection against background dark counts and a characteristic ``parity photon-number step'' saturation effect arising from squeezing parameter mismatch.

TL;DR: A two-oscillator model is proposed to study black hole evaporation, showing that energy exchange between the oscillators is consistent with quantum dynamics and entropy growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of energy transfer and information flow during black hole evaporation is a fundamental aspect of quantum gravity research. This study aims to explore such mechanisms using a simplified two-oscillator model.

Method: The analysis employs a coupled harmonic oscillator framework where one oscillator represents the black hole's geometry and the other represents Hawking radiation. The model introduces smooth envelopes for a continuous description and performs numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space.

Result: The two oscillators exchange energy in an approximately out-of-phase manner, indicating a conservation of quantum numbers. The reduced entropy increases periodically, suggesting entanglement generation. This minimal model successfully captures key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational framework for studying black hole evaporation using a two-mode system, highlighting the potential for more complex models to capture essential features of quantum gravity phenomena.

Abstract: We develop and analyze a two-oscillator model for black hole evaporation in which an effective geometric degree of freedom and a representative Hawking radiation mode are described by coupled harmonic oscillators with opposite signs in their free Hamiltonians. The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\langle n_x\rangle - \langle n_y\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation.

Abstract: We investigate the post-quench dynamics of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of 1D periodic systems with a suddenly changed Hamiltonian. The diagonal component with respect to the crystal momentum gives a metric corresponding to the variance of the time-evolved position, and its coefficient of the quadratic term in time is the group-velocity variance, signaling ballistic wavepacket dispersion. The other diagonal QGT component with respect to time reveals the energy variance. The off-diagonal QGT component features a real part as a covariance and an imaginary part representing a quench-induced curvature. Using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, our numerical results of different quenches confirm that the post-quench QGT is governed by physical quantities and local geometric objects from the initial state and post-quench bands, such as the Berry connection, group velocities, and energy variance. Furthermore, the connections between the QGT and physical observables suggest the QGT as a comprehensive probe for nonequilibrium phenomena.

Abstract: Exact synthesis provides unconditional optimality and canonical structure, but is often limited to small, carefully scoped regimes. We present an exact synthesis framework for two-qubit circuits over the Clifford+$T$ gate set that optimizes $T$-count exactly. Our approach exhausts a bounded search space, exploits algebraic canonicalization to avoid redundancy, and constructs a lookup table of optimal implementations that turns synthesis into a query. Algorithmically, we combine meet-in-the-middle ideas with provable pruning rules and problem-specific arithmetic designed for modern hardware. The result is an exact, reusable synthesis engine with substantially improved practical performance.

Conclusion: елиmic quantum error correction as universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry.

Abstract: We present a new geometric perspective on quantum error correction based on spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry.

Abstract: We find a tight characterization of the strong converse exponent for randomness extraction against quantum side information. In contrast to previous tight bounds, we employ a composable error criterion given by the fidelity (or purified distance) to a uniform distribution in product with the marginal state. The characterization is in terms of a club-sandwiched conditional entropy recently introduced by Rubboli, Goodarzi and Tomamichel and used by Li, Li and Yu to establish the strong converse exponent for the case of classical side information. This provides the first precise operational interpretation of this family of conditional entropies in the quantum setting.

Abstract: The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model that describes diverse complex phenomena in nature. However, simulating the NLSE on a quantum computer is inherently challenging due to the presence of the nonlinear term. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating the NLSE based on the split-step Fourier method. During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions. This work provide a concrete basis for analyzing accuracy-cost trade-offs in quantum-classical simulations of nonlinear dispersive wave dynamics.

Conclusion: 该研究在量子信息处理领域取得了重要进展，其解析解为高维QRACs的实现提供了理论基础和实验指导，同时揭示了高维量子测量与经典信息处理间的关键信息理论差距。

Abstract: Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) embody the fundamental trade-off between the compressibility of information into limited quantum resources and the accessibility of that information, serving as a cornerstone of quantum communication and computation. In particular, the $(n, n-1)$-QRACs, which encode $n$ bits of classical information into $n-1$ qubits, provides an ideal theoretical model for verifying quantum advantage in high-dimensional spaces; however, the analytical derivation of optimal codes for general $n$ has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish an analytical construction method for $(n, n-1)$-QRACs by using an explicit operator formalism. We prove that this construction strictly achieves the numerically conjectured upper bound of the average success probability, $\mathcal{P} = 1/2 + \sqrt{(n-1)/n}/2$, for all $n$. Furthermore, we present a systematic algorithm to decompose the derived optimal POVM into standard quantum gates. Since the resulting decoding circuit consists solely of interactions between adjacent qubits, it can be implemented with a circuit depth of $O(n)$ even under linear connectivity constraints. Additionally, we analyze the high-dimensional limit and demonstrate that while the non-commutativity of measurements is suppressed, an information-theoretic gap of $O(\log n)$ from the Holevo bound inevitably arises for symmetric encoding. This study not only provides a scalable implementation method for high-dimensional quantum information processing but also offers new insights into the mathematical structure at the quantum-classical boundary.

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental requirement in distributed quantum sensing networks, where multiple clients estimate spatially distributed parameters using shared quantum resources while interacting with potentially untrusted servers. Despite its importance, existing privacy conditions rely on idealized quantum bounds and do not fully capture the operational constraints imposed by realistic measurements. Here, we introduce a universal operational privacy framework for distributed quantum sensing, formulated in terms of the experimentally accessible classical Fisher information matrix and applicable to arbitrary protocols characterized by singular information structures. The proposed condition provides a protocol-independent criterion ensuring that no information about individual parameters is accessible to untrusted parties. We further experimentally demonstrate that a distributed quantum sensing protocol employing fewer photons than the number of estimated parameters simultaneously satisfies the universal privacy condition and achieves Heisenberg-limited precision. Our results establish universal operational constraints governing privacy in distributed quantum sensing networks and provide a foundation for practical, privacy-preserving quantum sensing beyond full-rank regimes.

Conclusion: 该研究为DSSs的工程设计提供了通用框架，显著提升超导量子位的相干时间和控制性能。

Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at dynamical sweet spots (DSSs) suppresses decoherence from low-frequency flux noise. A key open question is how long coherence can be extended under this strategy and what fundamental limits constrain it. Here we introduce a fully parameterized, multi-objective periodic-flux modulation framework that simultaneously optimizes energy relaxation $T_1$ and pure dephasing $T_φ$, thereby quantifying the tradeoff between them. For fluxonium qubits with realistic noise spectra, our method enhances $T_φ$ by a factor of 3-5 compared with existing DSS strategies while maintaining $T_1$ in the hundred-microsecond range. We further prove that, although DSSs eliminate first-order sensitivity to low-frequency noise, relaxation rate cannot be reduced arbitrarily close to zero, establishing an upper bound on achievable $T_1$. At the optimized working points, we identify double-DSS regions that are insensitive to both DC and AC flux, providing robust operating bands for experiments. As applications, we design single- and two-qubit control protocols at these operating points and numerically demonstrate high-fidelity gate operations. These results establish a general and useful framework for Pareto-front engineering of DSSs that substantially improves coherence and gate performance in superconducting qubits.

Abstract: The advent of promising quantum error correction (QEC) codes with efficient resource utilization and high-performance fault-tolerant quantum memories signifies a critical step towards realizing practical quantum computation. While surface codes have been a dominant approach, their limitations have spurred the development of more advanced QEC architectures. These advanced codes often present increased complexity, demanding innovative decoding methodologies. This work investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, including hybrid and multi-agent approaches, to enhance the decoding of various advanced QEC architectures. By leveraging the ability of RL to learn optimal strategies from noisy syndrome measurements, we explore the potential for achieving improved logical error rates and scalability compared to traditional decoding methods. Our approach examines the adaptation of reinforcement learning to exploit the structural properties of these modern QEC models. We also explore the benefits of combining different RL algorithms to address the multifaceted nature of the decoding problem, considering factors such as code degeneracy and real-world noise characteristics. With our proposed method, we are able to demonstrate that an autonomously trained agent can derive decoding schemes for the complex decoding requirement of advanced QEC architectures.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables information-theoretically secure key generation between legitimate parties. To further enhance system performance, an improved two-way CV-QKD protocol has been proposed, which is accessible in practice and exhibits increased robustness against excess noise. However, in practical implementations, device nonidealities inevitably drive the optical field from the single-mode regime into the continuous-mode regime. In this work, we introduce temporal modes to characterize the evolution of optical fields in the improved two-way protocol and establish a security analysis framework for the continuous-mode scenario based on adaptive normalization with calibrated shot-noise unit. In addition, finite-size effects are taken into account in the analysis. Our results demonstrate that the improved two-way protocol retains a performance advantage over one-way counterpart. The analysis provides useful guidance for the practical implementation and performance optimization of improved two-way CV-QKD systems.

Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation of oscillating signals over a broad bandwidth is a central task in quantum sensing, yet it is often compromised by spurious responses to higher-order harmonics in realistic multi-frequency environments. Here we experimentally demonstrate a high-accuracy and broadband quantum frequency sensing protocol based on geodesic control, implemented using the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By engineering an intrinsically single-frequency response, geodesic control enables bias-free frequency estimation with strong suppression of harmonic-induced systematic errors across a wide spectral range spanning from the megahertz to the gigahertz regime. Furthermore, by incorporating synchronized readout, we achieve millihertz-level frequency resolution under noisy signal conditions. Our results provide systematic experimental benchmarking of geodesic control for quantum frequency sensing and establish it as a practical approach for high-accuracy metrology in realistic environments.

This work provides an experimentally feasible scheme for remote magnon-phonon entanglement generation.

Motivation: The ability to generate long-distance quantum entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum information processing. This paper contributes to the field by introducing a novel protocol for creating such entanglement in a hybrid system, which could have significant implications for quantum communication and computation.

Conclusion: This paper advances the field of quantum information processing by introducing a novel protocol for generating remote magnon-phonon entanglement in a hybrid system. The method offers a promising approach for creating long-distance entanglement, which is vital for quantum communication and computation, and could pave the way for future experimental implementations. The demonstration of various forms of entanglement and the enhancement through dissipative interactions highlight the potential of this protocol in advancing quantum technologies.

Abstract: Generating long-distance quantum entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum information processing.

Beyond basic magnon-phonon two-mode entanglement, it supports genuine multimode entanglement between a single phonon and multiple magnons, bipartite entanglement between a single magnon and multiple phonons, as well as genuine four-mode entanglement involving two magnons and two phonons. Moreover, we show that dissipative magnon-magnon interactions mediated by traveling photons can generate substantially stronger long-distance entanglement than coherent couplings.

Abstract: On a quantum particle in the unit interval $[0,1]$, perform a position measurement with inaccuracy $1/n$ and then a quantum measurement of the projection $|φ\rangle\langleφ|$ with some arbitrary but fixed normalized $φ$. Call the outcomes $X \in[0,1]$ and $Y \in\{0,1\}$. We show that in the limit $n\to\infty$ corresponding to perfect precision for $X$, the probability of $Y=1$ tends to 0 for every $φ$. Since there is no density matrix, pure or mixed, which upon measurement of any $|φ\rangle\langleφ|$ yields outcome 1 with probability 0, our result suggests that a novel type of quantum state beyond Hilbert space is necessary to describe a quantum particle after a perfect position measurement.

Abstract: Incorporating van der Waals (vdW) superconductors into Josephson elements extends circuit-QED beyond conventional Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions and enables microwave probes of unconventional condensates and subgap excitations. In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~μ$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.

Abstract: Linear oscillators contribute to most branches of contemporary quantum science. They have already successfully served as quantum sensors and memories, found applications in quantum communication, and hold promise for cluster-state-based quantum computing. To master universal quantum processing with linear oscillators, an unconditional nonlinear operation is required. We propose such an operation using light-mediated interaction with another system that possesses a nonlinearity equivalent to more than a quadratic potential. Such a potential grants access to a nonlinear operation that can be broadcast to the target linear system. The nonlinear character of the operation can be verified by observing adequate negative values of the target system's Wigner function and the squeezing of the variance of a certain nonlinear combination of the quadratures below the thresholds attainable by Gaussian states. We explicitly evaluate an optically levitated mechanical oscillator as a flexible source of nonlinearity for a proof-of-principle demonstration of the nonlinearity broadcasting to linear systems, for example, mechanical oscillators or macroscopic atomic spin ensembles.

TL;DR: DynQ is a dynamic, topology-agnostic QVM that uses quality-weighted community detection to partition quantum processors based on execution regions that maximize internal gate quality and minimize crosstalk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and efficient quantum computing while addressing hardware heterogeneity and transient defects drives this innovation.

Method: DynQ employs a weighted graph model derived from live calibration data, dynamically discovering optimal execution regions for quantum programs.

Result:  DynQ achieves up to 19.1% higher fidelity and 45.1% lower output error on hardware with spatial quality variation. It also maintains high fidelity (over 86%) even when baseline executions fail due to transient defects.

Conclusion: DynQ represents a significant advancement in quantum virtualization by enabling scalable, robust, and high-fidelity execution across diverse quantum hardware.

Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms remain fundamentally non-virtualised: despite rapid hardware scaling, each user program still monopolises an entire quantum processor, preventing resource sharing, economic scalability, and quality-of-service differentiation. Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which dominate real quantum devices. We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. On hardware with pronounced spatial quality variation, DynQ achieves up to 19.1 percent higher fidelity and 45.1 percent lower output error. When transient hardware defects cause baseline executions to fail completely, DynQ adapts dynamically and achieves over 86 percent fidelity. By transforming calibrated device graphs into adaptive virtual hardware abstractions, DynQ decouples quantum programs from fragile physical layouts and enables reliable, high-utilisation quantum cloud services.

Conclusion: AME态与该特定编码的局域对称与可逆传递门群存在密切关系，且通过分次Lie代数理论，它们的生成元得以明确。

Abstract: We provide a proof that there exists a bijection between local unitary (LU) orbits of absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states in $(\mathbb{C}^D)^{\otimes n}$ where $n$ is even, also known as perfect tensors, and LU orbits of $((n-1,D,n/2))_D$ quantum error correcting codes. Thus, by a result of Rather et al. (2023), the AME state of 4 qutrits and the pure $((3,3,2))_3$ qutrit code $\mathcal{C}$ are both unique up to the action of the LU group. We further explore the connection between the 4-qutrit AME state and the code $\mathcal{C}$ by showing that the group of transversal gates of $\mathcal{C}$ and the group of local symmetries of the AME state are closely related. Taking advantage of results from Vinberg's theory of graded Lie algebras, we find generators of both of these groups.

Motivation: The research is driven by the need for reliable quantum state transfer in systems like Rydberg atom chains, which naturally exhibit extended models supporting topologically protected edge states.

Method: The study combines theoretical frameworks with calculations using time-independent and time-dependent protocols, leveraging coherent dynamics and adiabatic parameter modulation.

Result: Long-range couplings significantly improve transfer efficiency compared to nearest-neighbor models, achieving robustness against disorder due to their topological origin.

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable approach for quantum state transfer, demonstrating the potential of long-range interactions in fault-tolerant quantum computing and communication networks.)

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for fast, robust and high-fidelity topological quantum state transfer in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings, motivated by chains of Rydberg atoms with dipole-dipole interactions. Such long-range interactions naturally give rise to extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models supporting topologically protected edge states. We show that these edge states enable high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer using both time-independent protocols, based on coherent edge state dynamics, and time-dependent protocols, based on adiabatic modulation of system parameters. Long-range couplings play a central role by enhancing the relevant energy gaps, leading to a substantial improvement in transfer efficiency compared to nearest neighbour models. The resulting transfer is robust against positional disorder, reflecting its topological origin and highlighting the potential of long-range interacting platforms for reliable quantum state transfer.

Abstract: Advances in quantum technologies are accelerating the demand for optical quantum state sensors that combine high precision, versatility, and scalability within a unified hardware platform. Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/γ\approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes. By reducing reliance on material nonlinearity and reservoir size, the proposed approach facilitates the practical deployment of high-fidelity photonic quantum sensors on existing integrated platforms, paving the way toward chip-scale quantum processors and photonic sensing technologies.

### [72] [Quantum Circuit Pre-Synthesis: Learning Local Edits to Reduce $T$-count](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19738)
*Daniele Lizzio Bosco,Lukasz Cincio,Giuseppe Serra,M. Cerezo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a new strategy for compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+T gates, aiming to reduce the number of T gates required, which are costly in fault-tolerant quantum computing. The authors propose Q-PreSyn, a method that uses a reinforcement learning agent to identify effective local edits to a circuit, thereby reducing the T-count after synthesis


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With T-gates being a significant portion of the cost in fault-tolerant quantum computing, reducing their number is crucial for practical applications. Traditional methods like exact synthesis are too slow, so new approaches are needed

Method: The paper introduces Q-PreSyn, which uses a reinforcement learning agent to guide local edits to a circuit. These edits are then used in synthesis to produce a circuit with fewer T-gates. The method is tested on circuits with up to 25 qubits

Result: Experiments show that Q-PreSyn can reduce the T-count by up to 20% without introducing additional errors before synthesis

Conclusion: Q-PreSyn is an effective strategy for reducing T-gate counts in large-scale quantum circuits, making fault-tolerant quantum computing more feasible.

Abstract: Compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+$T$ gates is a central task for fault-tolerant quantum computing using stabilizer codes. In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis. Experimental results of our proposed strategy, applied on top of well-known synthesis algorithms, show up to a $20\%$ reduction in $T$-count on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis.

Abstract: We treat inter-branch message transfer in a Wigner's-friend circuit as a practical benchmark for near-term superconducting quantum processors. Implementing Violaris' unitary message-transfer primitive, we compare performance across IBM Eagle, Nighthawk, and Heron (r2/r3) processors for message sizes up to $n=32$, without error mitigation. We study three message families -- sparse (one-hot), half-weight, and dense -- and measure conditional string success $p_{\mathrm{all}}=\Pr(P=μ\mid R=0)$, memory erasure after uncomputation, and correlation diagnostics (branch contrast and bitwise mutual information). The sparse family compiles to essentially constant two-qubit depth, yielding a depth-controlled probe of device noise: at $n=32$ we observe $p_{\mathrm{all}}$ spanning $\approx0.07$ to $\approx0.68$ across backends. In contrast, half and dense messages incur rapidly growing routing overhead, and transpiler-seed variability becomes a practical limitation near the coherence frontier. We further report an amplitude sweep (no-amplification test) and a divergence ``cousins'' sweep that quantifies degradation with branch-conditioned complexity. All data and figure-generation scripts are released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improves understanding of quantum state discrimination and expands the framework of allowed measurements.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis and mathematical proofs to explore quantum state discrimination under different measurement schemes.

Result: Demonstrated that non-positive operator-valued measurements can achieve sub-Helstrom error probabilities, challenging the traditional restriction to positive operator-valued measurements.

Conclusion: Expands the potential for better quantum state discrimination by relaxing measurement constraints, with implications for quantum information processing tasks.

Abstract: The minimum error probability for distinguishing between two quantum states is bounded by the Helstrom limit, derived under the assumption that measurement strategies are restricted to positive operator-valued measurements. We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, indicating the use of measurement operations that go beyond the standard positive operator-valued measurements framework. We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination. Interestingly, even initial product states can give rise to effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem, and achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination error when discriminating quantum states of the subsystem.

Motivation: Improving quantum computing scalability and reducing processing times is crucial for advancing quantum technologies.

Method: This work introduces a scalable architecture with short-range shuttling for 3D connectivity on 2D devices, utilizing quantum error correction. It demonstrates the native implementation of folded surface codes and optimized logical gates.

Result: The architecture reduces gate times and magic-state distillation efficiency, showing potential for faster quantum computing.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for more efficient two-dimensional quantum computing platforms and scalable gate operations.

Abstract: Qubit shuttling has become an indispensable ingredient for scaling leading quantum computing platforms, including semiconductor spin, neutral-atom, and trapped-ion qubits, enabling both crosstalk reduction and tighter integration of control hardware. Cai et al. (2023) proposed a scalable architecture that employs short-range shuttling to realize effective three-dimensional connectivity on a strictly two-dimensional device. Building on recent advances in quantum error correction, we show that this architecture enables the native implementation of folded surface codes on 2D hardware, reducing the runtime of all single-qubit logical Clifford gates and logical CNOTs within subsets of qubits from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ in conventional surface code lattice surgery to constant time. We present explicit protocols for these operations and demonstrate that access to a transversal $S$ gate reduces the spacetime volume of 8T-to-CCZ magic-state distillation by more than an order of magnitude compared with standard 2D lattice surgery approaches. Finally, we introduce a new "virtual-stack" layout that more efficiently exploits the quasi-three-dimensional structure of the architecture, enabling efficient multilayer routing on these two-dimensional devices.

Abstract: Low check weight is practically crucial code property for fault-tolerant quantum computing, which underlies the strong interest in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Here, we explore the theory of weight-constrained stabilizer codes from various foundational perspectives including the complexity of computing code weight and the explicit boundary of feasible low-weight codes in both theoretical and practical settings. We first prove that calculating the optimal code weight is an $\mathsf{NP}$-hard problem, demonstrating the necessity of establishing bounds for weight that are analytical or efficiently computable. Then we systematically investigate the feasible code parameters with weight constraints. We provide various explicit analytical lower bounds and in particular completely characterize stabilizer codes with weight at most 3, showing that they have distance 2 and code rate at most 1/4. We also develop a powerful linear programming (LP) scheme for setting code parameter bounds with weight constraints, which yields exact optimal weight values for all code parameters with $n\leq 9$. We further refined this constraint from multiple perspectives by considering the generator weight distribution and overlap. In particular, we consider practical architectures and demonstrate how to apply our methods to e.g.~the IBM 127-qubit chip. Our study brings the weight as a crucial parameter into coding theory and provide guidance for code design and utility in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Graph states provide a powerful framework for describing multipartite entanglement in quantum information science. In their standard formulation, graph states are generated by controlled-$Z$ interactions and naturally encode symmetric exchange properties. Here we establish a precise correspondence between graph topology and exchange symmetry by proving that a graph state is fully symmetric under particle permutations if and only if the underlying graph is complete. We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. Together, these results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry based on graph completeness and edge orientation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Distinct monitoring or intervention schemes can produce different conditioned stochastic quantum trajectories while sharing the same unconditional (ensemble-averaged) dynamics. This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary "kick" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics.

Abstract: Turing patterns are a central paradigm for describing spatial patterns in nature. The corresponding theory of reaction-diffusion dynamics combines ideal diffusion with nonlinear reactions, resulting in patterns when species diffuse at different rates and reactions are sufficiently nonlinear. However, real systems are more complex and particularly involve physical interactions between constituents. While such interactions can promote patterns, we here show that they can also induce dynamic, chaotic patterns. These patterns exhibit well-defined length and time scales, which result from cycles of droplet coarsening and fission. The dynamical patterns combine properties of traditional Turing patterns and chemically active droplets, which emerge for strong physical interactions. Our analysis thus reveals three qualitatively different regimes that emerge when two components interact physically and undergo nonlinear reactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Development of novel gamma-ray beam sources is essential for applications in science, particularly in hadron photoproduction and laser-driven proton beams.

Method: Used a Mo/Si multilayer mirror to reflect extreme ultraviolet (92 eV) photons back into a 1 GeV ring (NewSUBARU) for backward Compton scattering to generate gamma rays.

Result: Produced a gamma-ray beam with an energy spectrum up to 0.543 GeV and a production rate of 1.4 ± 0.1 kcps above 0.160 GeV, validated by theoretical calculations.

Conclusion: This approach successfully demonstrates a new gamma-ray source with potential applications in future experiments requiring high-energy photon beams.

Abstract: Compton scattering of photons off high-energy electrons is a fundamental quantum mechanical process widely utilized to produce a $γ$-ray beam for scientific research. Instead of injecting laser light into a storage ring as a conventional way, we have developed an innovative method to achieve drastically higher energies approaching the ring energy by the backward Compton scattering of extreme ultraviolet light. In this method, $92$ $\mathrm{eV}$ photons obtained from an undulator in a storage ring were reflected back to the original ring using a Mo/Si multilayer mirror. Consequently, $γ$-ray beam production through the extreme ultraviolet light Compton scattering was observed for the first time in a demonstration experiment at the $1$ $\mathrm{GeV}$ ring, NewSUBARU. The measured energy spectrum was well reproduced by a theoretical calculation with the maximum energy of $0.543$ $\mathrm{GeV}$. The production rate was $1.4 \pm 0.1$ kcps for the energies above $0.160$ $\mathrm{GeV}$. This rate was quantitatively explained by the luminosity and the scattering cross section. The present work paved the way to create a new $γ$-ray beam source for future applications such as hadron photoproduction experiments.

Motivation: 高能电子束在相撞过程中可能产生的不稳定性问题，尤其是由于强度不同导致的翻转-重叠不稳定性，影响了高能电子束的有效利用。因此，寻找有效的方法来控制相撞束的强度以避免这种不稳定性，是研究的重要背景。

Method: 该论文提出了一种利用激光驱动的康阴堡逆 Compton回散方法和一种不易损坏的基Browse collimator的方法来控制高能电子束的强度。康阴堡逆Compton回散是一种利用激光与高能电子束相互作用以调整相撞束的方法，可以通过调整激光的参数来控制相撞束的强度。而基Browse collometer是一种利用激光在束流中的全息投影特性，能够持续稳定地导向电子束，避免传统分立式分束器在高亮度下的局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了利用激光驱动的康阴堡逆Compton回散方法和不可破坏基Browsecollimator来控制高能电子束强度，避免了翻转-重叠不稳定性，并通过 FACET-II 中的 E344 实验进行了理论模拟和实验验证。该方法为 FCC-ee 的高能电子束相撞控制提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Laser-driven Compton backscattering (CBS) has been proposed as method for controlling the intensity of colliding bunches in the FCC-ee so as to avoid the flip-flop instability caused by intensity asymmetry in colliding bunches. Laser-based collimation has also been proposed as an indestructible collimator for high-intensity electron beams. We have initiated a laboratory-based test program of these concepts with the E344 experiment at FACET-II. In this paper, we describe simulations of laser-beam interactions at FACET-II and the relevant scaling for FCC-ee. We also describe the experimental setup and diagnostics that will be used to make the measurements at FACET-II.

Conclusion: 讨论了耗散性在量子多体系统中的应用前景

Abstract: We investigate and compare two particle number conserving protocols for the preparation of a topologically nontrivial state. The first is derived from thermally coupling the system to a cold bath, while the second is based on engineered dissipation. We numerically study the time required to reach the target state as well as its robustness against physically important perturbations. Crucially, in both protocols the cooling capability is limited by dissipatively induced diffusion processes. The resulting quadratic scaling of the cooling time with system size is corroborated also analytically using mean-field approximations and a purely classical random walk model. Furthermore, we find that the engineered protocol admits a unique and stable dark state, which contributes to an ongoing discussion regarding the applicability of dissipative state preparation to many-body systems.

Conclusion: 该研究通过解析解方法清晰地揭示了不同相互作用类型下Efimov状态的三体参数特性，并表明有限横向束缚效应在描述实际物理系统中的Efimov态时具有重要性。

Abstract: We study the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials. Using the quantum defect theory, we obtain analytical solutions for both repulsive and attractive $1/r^3$ interactions. The obtained discrete-scale-invariant energies and wave functions, validated by excellent agreement with numerical results, provide a natural framework for describing the universality of Efimov states in mixed dimension. Specifically, we consider a three-body system consisting of two heavy particles with large dipole moments confined to a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and resonantly interacting with an unconfined light particle. With the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this system is effectively reduced to the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and $1/r^2$ potentials, and manifests the Efimov effect. Our analytical solution suggests that, for repulsive dipole interactions, the three-body parameter of the mixed-dimensional Efimov states is universally set by the dipolar length scale, whereas for attractive interactions it explicitly depends on the short-range phase. We also investigate the effects of finite transverse confinement and find that our analytical results are useful for describing the Efimov states composed of two polar molecules and a light atom.

TL;DR: Researchers propose a new design for vibration control using Kelvin-cell lattices with geometric modifications, showing potential for effective wave filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve wave filtering in lightweight structures through geometric modifications.

Method: Twisting the cell's faces to break symmetry, preserving lattice topology, using analytical and finite-element methods.

Result: Obtained up to 20 dB wave attenuation in simulations, validated experimentally.

Conclusion: Geometric modifications enhance wave filtering in lightweight lattices, providing a practical design strategy.

Abstract: This work investigates the propagation of elastic waves in periodic Kelvin-cell chains, focusing on symmetry-breaking geometric modifications induced by twisting the cell's faces. By imposing such twists, the original lattice topology is preserved, while mirror symmetries are strategically broken through modifying a single geometric parameter, allowing wave characteristics to be adjusted without additional resonators or mass augmentation. The complex-valued Bloch-Floquet analysis reveals that twisting activates two distinct wave attenuation mechanisms: Bragg-type band gaps associated with periodicity-induced scattering, and polarization-dependent band gaps arising from longitudinal-torsional mode coupling and avoided crossings. To obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into these mechanisms, a simplified analytical model with coupled translational and rotational degrees of freedom is considered. The finite-element wave transmission calculations are experimentally validated on SLA-printed three-cell specimens, for which wave attenuation reaches up to 20 dB within the predicted band-gap frequencies. Note that high prediction accuracy requires accounting for viscoelastic material behavior, underscoring the importance of material behavior on the wave propagation characteristics. Overall, the findings show that modest geometric modifications to a classical Kelvin-cell lattice can enhance wave-filtering behavior, offering a tractable design strategy for vibration control in lightweight architected lattices.

Abstract: This paper presents a design framework for synthesizing angularly selective spatial filters using non-uniform metagratings. While traditional metagratings focus on channeling energy into higher-order Floquet modes for a fixed incidence angle, we leverage the fundamental mode as a versatile degree of freedom to engineer spatial dispersion over a continuous angular spectrum. By strategically distributing non-uniformly loaded metallic wires and rigorously modeling their mutual interactions through an impedance-matrix formulation, we realize prescribed angular transfer functions with high efficiency. In particular, the framework is validated at 3.5 GHz through full-wave simulations of (i) low-pass, (ii) high-pass, and (iii) all-pass spatial filters. The results demonstrate that fundamental-mode engineering in non-uniform metagratins offers a highly efficient platform for advanced spatial wave manipulation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a nonlocal, dual-band reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designed for full-space beam synthesis at 4.0 GHz and 6.3 GHz. The constituent unit cells comprise a pair of interleaved sub-cells that are specifically engineered to operate independently at their respective target frequencies. This hardware-level decoupling facilitates an efficient synthesis framework based on microwave network theory (MNT) that rigorously accounts for mutual coupling within both bands. Under this framework, the optimal biasing for sub-cells is determined to achieve precise full-space beam synthesis at both frequencies. The proposed method is numerically and experimentally validated with an RIS comprising 14 X 14 varactor-loaded unit cells that can be individually biased. We experimentally demonstrate arbitrary beam profile synthesis beyond simple beam steering, including dual-beam and sector patterns in full space. Experimental and simulation results show good agreement with the MNT model, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We investigate the sedimentation and vertical hydraulic transport of irregular polymetallic nodules (PMNs) using resolved CFD-DEM with multisphere particles spanning $100 < Re_p < 3000$. Shape effects induce 2.0-2.3 times drag enhancement relative to volume-equivalent spheres, arising from 50\% larger frontal areas and wake asymmetry, reducing terminal velocities by 29-33\%. Vertical transport exhibits velocity-driven transitions from intermittent settling to stable convection, as demonstrated by residence-time and drag-force statistics. While PMNs exhibit enhanced rotational-translational coupling and broader force fluctuations, the regime progression qualitatively resembles that of volume-equivalent spherical particles. Drag variance evolution reveals contrasting behavior: small particles $(d/D=0.082)$ show narrow distributions and wake suppression at higher velocities, while large particles $(d/D=0.22)$ exhibit non-monotonic variance. These findings elucidate shape-confinement interactions in vertical transport and establish bounds on the applicability of volume-equivalent spherical particles in reduced-order models.

Abstract: Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.

Abstract: We report the design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of two-dimensional (2D) devices for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. Sub-micron geometric coordinate markers were etched into SiO2/Si wafers, serving as both substrates for 2D device integration and guiding maps for sample navigation. Here, we used a monolayer graphene/h-BN device with an active area of smaller than 20 um x 20 um as a model system and demonstrated that the device could be reliably located in STM solely through topographic imaging of the guiding patterns and in situ stage calibration, without reliance on optical viewports or capacitive sensing. Atomically resolved topographic imaging and tunneling spectroscopy were also obtained. Our proposed navigation strategy is fully compatible with standard device fabrication procedures and requires no hardware modification to existing STM setups. As such, it offers a practical alternative for locating miniaturized devices in STM, shedding light on studying emerging quantum phenomena in 2D systems.

Motivation: Understanding complex magnetic systems, particularly those with unconventional symmetries like altermagnetic behavior, is crucial. This research seeks to uncover the thermodynamic properties of the critical points in d-wave materials, which could lead to insights into quantum critical phenomena.

Method: The study employs a multi-method approach, including elastocaloric experiments to measure magnetocaloric effects, free-energy modeling to predict phase behaviors, and first-principles calculations on MnF$_2$ to determine magnetic properties and critical behavior.

Result: The combined methods reveal a finite-temperature critical point in MnF$_2$, demonstrating general applicability of the elastocaloric effect to detect d-wave altermagnetic phase transitions.

Conclusion: This work identifies MnF$_2$ as a promising material system for studying altermagnetic and quantum critical behavior. The findings contribute to the understanding of unconventional magnetic phases and phase transitions in d-wave materials.

Abstract: Altermagnets break a combination of time-reversal and rotational symmetries without generating a net magnetization. As such, the order parameter of $d$-wave altermagnets has the same symmetry as magnetic multipoles, and couples to the product of a magnetic field and uniaxial strain. We combine elastocaloric experiments, free-energy modeling, and first-principles calculations on MnF$_2$ to establish a thermodynamic probe of the predicted finite-temperature altermagnetic critical point. These results pave the way to explore altermagnetic quantum criticality in $d$-wave materials and beyond.

Abstract: The Kitaev model is exactly solvable in terms of Majorana fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice and coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field, giving the possibility of $π$-vortices in hexagonal plaquettes. In the vortex-full sector and in the presence of a time-reversal-breaking three-spin term of strength $κ$, the energy spectrum is gapped and the ground state possesses an even Chern number. An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $ε$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $ε$ in the two limits of small or large $κ$. The analytical approach is confirmed by numerical perturbation theory directly on the lattice. The latter is in excellent agreement with the full numerics on a finite-size system. We contrast our results with states bound to an isolated vortex in a topological superconductor with even Chern number.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motiva tion is to observe and understand the Wigner-Mott insulating states, mechanisms of electron correlations, and their experimental realization.

Method: The method involves using scanning tunneling microscopy to inject electrons into a layered material and observe resulting charge orderings and insulating phases. The study combines experimental observations with computational analysis of onsite and long-range interactions.

Result: The results demonstrate the formation of a Wigner-Mott insulating state characterized by a √3×√3 superstructure in 6R-TaS₂, with a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. This state requires both onsite interaction (U) and long-range Coulomb interaction (V).

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Wigner-Mott insulating states can be directly observed and controlled in layered materials, providing fundamental insights into strong electron correlations and establishing a platform for further research and potential applications.

Abstract: Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating states in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ superstructure constitutes a Wigner-Mott insulating state, characterized by a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. Comparative measurements reveal that the conventional 1$\times$1 Mott state at integer filling is governed predominantly by onsite interaction U, whereas the $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ fractional-filling Mott state requires the cooperative effects of both U and long-range Coulomb interaction V. Our results provide not only the direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism, but also establish a platform for the controllable realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.

Abstract: Geometric frustration among competing spin exchanges can give rise to novel quantum phases by enhancing fluctuations that drive magnetic systems beyond the classical regime. We investigate the frustrated array of strongly correlated spin dimers in the bilayer triangular lattice antiferromagnet \rcs{} under applied magnetic fields. A cascade of magnetization plateaus appears at \(M/M_s = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3,\) and \(5/6\), together with a weak anomalous feature near \(M/M_s = 1/6\), in fields up to 60 T. Concurrent changes in magneto-dielectric response follows the plateau boundaries. The finite slope of each plateau and the absence of a zero-field gap in our ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility down to 20 mK indicate broken \(U(1)\) spin-rotation symmetry. A minimal bilayer-dimer model treated with bond operator representation reproduces the low-field sequence only when \(U(1)\) symmetry is explicitly lifted by spin-orbit-driven, bond-dependent anisotropy. Near saturation, a projected triangular pseudospin model accounts for the high-field plateaus with modest further-neighbor interactions. These results demonstrate that anisotropic exchange arising from spin-orbit-coupled moments is essential for stabilizing the full plateau hierarchy in \rcs{}, a mechanism overlooked in previous interpretations of Co-based triangular bilayers.

Conclusion: 该方法通过实数时间动力学绕过虚拟时间或频域方法的限制，为DMFT在量子计算硬件上的实现提供了新途径，解决了两站点DMFT近似在捕捉细节谱特征方面的缺陷。

Abstract: We present a time-domain iteration scheme for solving the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) self-consistent equations using retarded Green's functions in real time. Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.

Abstract: We present a Rydberg atom-based microwave electric field sensor that achieves extended dynamic range and enhanced sensitivity across a broad bandwidth. By characterizing the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting induced by a single-tone microwave field, we demonstrate a spectroscopic method that simultaneously extracts both the microwave frequency and electric field strength directly from the splitting pattern. We implement dual-tone heterodyne detection, achieving a minimum detectable field strength on the order of uV/cm and a sensitivity in the sub-uV/cm/Hz^1/2 regime, while extending the operational bandwidth up to 3 GHz. Through systematic characterization of frequency and power dependencies, we identify optimal operating conditions to minimize power broadening in the resonant AT regime and maximize sensitivity in the far-off-resonance AC Stark regime. The resulting platform combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, and a dynamic range of approximately 90 dB, establishing Rydberg atoms as practical sensors for precision electric field metrology.

TL;DR: This paper uses high-precision spectroscopy to measure the $2	extsuperscript{3}S_1 	o 2	extsuperscript{1}S_0$ transition frequency in $^4$He with a very precise measurement of 48 Hz uncertainty, improving on previous results and providing insights into the charge-radius difference between alpha and helion particles through theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to improve the measurement of the helium transition frequency, which is crucial for advancing atomic energy level theory and understanding the relationship between nuclear charge radii and other particles like the alpha particle.

Method: The method involved using a Bose-Einstein condensed sample in a magic-wavelength optical dipole trap, suppressing Doppler shifts through time-resolved ion detection, and calibrating the transition frequency using a White Rabbit link to a remote active hydrogen maser clock.

Result: The study obtained the most precise determination to date of the charge-radius difference between the alpha and helion particles, $r_{h}^2 - r_α^2 = 1.0676(10)	ext{fm}^2$, which is consistent with other recent findings.

Conclusion: This precise measurement contributes to resolving discrepancies between QED predictions and experimental observations in helium ionization energies and supports the use of atomic spectroscopy as a tool for studying nuclear charge radii.

Abstract: High-precision spectroscopy of simple atomic systems can be used to advance the theory of atomic energy levels but can also serve as a sensitive probe of nuclear charge radii. For this last purpose, we report an improved measurement of the $2\,^3{S}_1 \to 2\,^1{S}_0$ transition frequency in $^4$He with 48 Hz uncertainty (0.25 ppt), using a Bose-Einstein condensed sample confined in a magic-wavelength optical dipole trap. A systematic Doppler shift from condensate motion is suppressed by time-resolved ion detection, and the transition frequency is calibrated via a White Rabbit link to a remote active hydrogen maser clock. Combined with previous $^3$He measurements and improved theory, we obtain the most precise determination to date of the charge-radius difference between the alpha and helion particles of $r_{h}^2 -r_α^2$ of $1.0676(10)\text{fm}^2$. This is consistent with other recent determinations and confirms that the current discrepancy between QED theory and experimentally observed ionization energies of excited states in helium is not apparent in the isotope shift.

Abstract: Electron-atom collisions in warm dense plasmas are crucial for astrophysics and controlled fusion research, where calculating short-range scattering matrices under screening plasma potentials is essential. While electron-neutral atom collisions are tractable using the standard Riccati-Bessel wavefunctions in the asymptotic region, electron-ion collisions face challenges due to the extended range of the screened Coulomb potential, which lacks analytical solutions or numerical code packages for asymptotic regular and irregular wavefunctions. We introduce an R-matrix theoretical framework for general screened potentials and develop a numerical method to compute these asymptotic wavefunctions efficiently. Our approach yields short-range scattering phase shifts that remain invariant with respect to the matching point in the asymptotic region. Applying the Debye screening potential as an illustrative example, we calculate elastic and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for H-like ions (He, C, Ne) across varying temperatures and densities. The calculations show that Debye screening systematically modifies resonance structures and progressively lowers excitation thresholds. Nevertheless, the effective collision strengths and rate coefficients exhibit approximate scaling laws. These findings enable convenient access to electron collision data in plasma environments, advancing plasma diagnostics and modeling.

Abstract: Optical trapping is a well_established, decades old technology with applications in several fields of research. The most common scenario deals with particles that tend to be centered on the brightest part of the optical trap. Consequently, the optical forces keep the particle away from the dark zones of the beam. However, this is not the case when a focused doughnut_shaped beam generates on_axis trapping. In this system, the particle is centered on the intensity minima of the laser beam and the bright annular part lies on the periphery of the particle. Researchers have shown great interest in this phenomenon due to its advantage of reducing light interaction with trapped particles and the intriguing increase in the trapping strength. This work presents experimental and theoretical results that extend the analysis of on_axis trapping with light vortex beams. Specifically, in our experiments, we trap micron_sized spherical silica (SiO2) particles in water and we measure, through the power spectrum density method, the trap stiffness constant \k{appa} generated by vortex beams with different topological charge orders. The optical forces are calculated from the exact solutions of the electromagnetic fields provided by the generalized Lorentz_Mie theory. We show a remarkable agreement between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurements of \k{appa}. Moreover, our numerical model gives us information about the electromagnetic fields inside the particle, offering valuable insights into the influence of the electromagnetic fields present in the vortex beam trapping scenario.

Abstract: Flat-band states in topological systems provide a unique platform for investigating strongly correlated phenomena and many body physics. However, in 2D static tight-binding systems, perfectly flat bands can only exist in the topologically trivial phase, as characterized by a zero Chern number. Here we show that by introducing periodic driving into a 2D photonic Lieb lattice composed of coupled microring resonators, the resulting Floquet topological insulator can host perfectly flat bands with nontrivial topology. In particular, by tracking the evolution of the flat-band modes over each cycle, we show that the non-Abelian displacements of the flat-band modes are characterized by a nontrivial quantized helicity even though the quasi-energy bands have zero Chern number. The helical motion of the flat-band modes can be described by a braiding of the world lines of their trajectories, with a nontrivial winding number directly connected to the helicity. We also propose a scheme to experimentally measure the quantized non-Abelian helicity in a microring lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. These results suggest that Floquet topological photonic insulators based on coupled microring resonators can provide a versatile platform for investigating non-Abelian topological physics and strongly correlated phenomena in photonic flat-band systems.

TL;DR: This paper discusses a flexible and biocompatible PDRC (passive daytime radiative cooling) system for wearable or wearable surfaces with conformal shapes. The cooling system is integrated onto a fiberglass cast and uses a bilayer polymer design with PVA and PMMA layers, incorporating CPP ceramic particles for improved thermal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for flexible PDRC systems to widen their application beyond rigid substrates, addressing the limitations in optical performance and substrate rigidity.

Method: The PDRC system was developed using a bilayer polymer design (PVA and PMMA) with CPP particles embedded for thermal and optical properties. The system was tested on a fiberglass cast and evaluated under outdoor sunlight.

Result: The system achieved over 90% solar reflectance and up to 15°C sub-ambient cooling in direct sunlight. The design is highly conductive, durable, and biocompatible, eliminating the need for additional materials.

Conclusion: This system represents a step forward in creating conformal, flexible, and sustainable PDRC for wearable and industrial applications.

Abstract: Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) provides an energy-free approach to suppress surface temperatures by reflecting solar irradiation while emitting thermal radiation through the mid-infrared atmospheric window. Despite rapid progress in optical performance, most PDRC systems remain limited by rigid, fragile, or planar substrates, restricting their use on flexible, curved, or wearable surfaces. Here, we report a biocompatible and structurally robust PDRC system integrated onto a commercial rapid-curing fiberglass cast, a conformal substrate widely used in orthopedic and industrial applications. The cooling architecture adopts a bilayer polymer design consisting of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) adhesion layer and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer, both embedded with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) ceramic particles derived from processed animal bone waste. The bio-derived CPP simultaneously enables broadband solar scattering and high mid-infrared emittance, while offering sustainability and biocompatibility advantages. The resulting composite exhibits over 90% solar reflectance and achieves up to 15 C sub-ambient cooling under direct outdoor sunlight.

Motivation: The paper aims to demonstrate high-energy, high-repetition-rate scaling in regenerative amplifiers to enable advanced laser applications.

Result: Energy of several joules can be achieved at kHz repetition rates with stable operation.

Conclusion: The research contributes to achieving high-energy, high-repetition scaling for future applications.

Abstract: We report on energy scaling of a 2.08-μm wavelength regenerative amplifier (RA) system based on the broadband gain material Ho:CaAlGdO4 (CALGO) to multi-mJ pulse energy at kHz repetition rates. Compared to previous reports, energy scaling was enabled thanks to an upgraded seed laser with a higher fluence and better spectral overlap to the gain spectrum of Ho:CALGO, which increased amplification efficiency. Bifurcation-free energy extraction was investigated experimentally and numerically for various repetition rates. A stable output was obtained at 10 W average power for repetition rates of 30 kHz and above. In addition, stable 3.4-mJ energy extraction was achieved at a 1-kHz repetition rate. We discuss the further scaling potential of pulse energy and pulse duration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging challenges due to obstructions like raindrops, fences, and dust in space-constrained systems, necessitating compact and efficient solutions.

Method: Divide spectrum of RGB channels into pass and stop bands using multi-band filtering, train the metalens to focus distant objects, and enhance with a neural network.

Result: Significant improvements in imaging quality and accuracy while maintaining compactness.

Conclusion: Innovative learned split-spectrum metalens provides robust, obstruction-free imaging for mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes.

Abstract: Obstructions such as raindrops, fences, or dust degrade captured images, especially when mechanical cleaning is infeasible. Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes.

Abstract: Spontaneous emission, as a fundamental radiative process and a versatile information carrier, plays a vital role in light-emitting devices, optical information modulation and encryption, super-resolution fluorescence imaging and nano sensing. Engineering the photonic environment surrounding quantum emitters can enhance their emission characteristics. However, simultaneously achieving precise control over both excitation enhancement and quantum-yield modulation at the nanoscale remains elusive, highlighting substantial room for advancing the precised engineering of quantum emission. Here, we introduce silicon Mie voids - air-defined cavities that invert the conventional solid-particle geometry - to achieve independent tuning of quantum emission within an individual subwavelength structure, while minimizing optical losses. Full-wave simulations and experiments on both gradient and uniform Mie-void arrays jointly validate this quantitative framework for emission tuning, which disentangles excitation enhancement arising from local field confinement in air and quantum-yield enhancement resulting from strengthened emitter-resonator coupling, while confirming the accelerated radiative decay enabled by the void configuration. Leveraging this flexible mechanism, we realize a bimodal nanophotonic pattern with near-diffraction-limited pixels that encode the EPFL logo in the bright field and the SJTU logo in both dark field and photoluminescence micrographs. These results establish Mie voids as a powerful platform for programmable, high-density multimodal displays and open new avenues for advancing state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices.

Abstract: Laser Shock Peening increases the fatigue life of metallic components by introducing beneficial compressive residual stresses. To achieve the desired effect, each individual laser pulse must be delivered correctly. Laser Shock Peening quality is typically verified by destructive and time-consuming residual stress measurements or by subjective operator judgement, which is non-objective and unsuitable for continuous in-line control. We propose a simple, low-cost and robust method based on the analysis of the acoustic response that automatically classifies individual laser pulses as defect-free or defective. We show that the acoustic response captured by a low-cost microphone carries sufficiently informative signatures to reliably distinguish correct from incorrect impacts and enables quality control at the level of single pulses. The method provides a non-destructive and objective route to real-time monitoring of Laser Shock Peening, with the potential to increase process reliability and support industrial deployment of this technology without the need for subsequent destructive measurements.

Abstract: Digital coding metasurfaces have revolutionized electromagnetic (EM) manipulation, yet typical tunable approaches based on active components suffer from the "volatility" bottleneck. While mechanical modulation provides a potential solution, current implementations generally lack inherent state-locking capability, rendering them vulnerable to environmental disturbances and actuation errors. Inspired by the concept of mechanical bits (MBs), this paper presents a self-locking non-volatile coding metasurface platform enabled by Kresling origami-based MBs, where the continuous mechanical deformation of individual meta-atoms is discretized into robust binary geometric states protected by intrinsic energy barriers. The bistable states are strictly mapped to 1-bit EM coding phases via tailored metallic patterns integrated onto a multimaterial 3D printed Kresling origami array. Building upon this concept, both transmission- and reflection-type prototypes are proposed and experimentally demonstrated, exhibiting exceptional wavefront manipulation capabilities through near-field holographic imaging and far-field beam steering. In addition, the lightweight origami unit (1.5 g) exhibits an exceptional load-bearing capacity, supporting over 100 times its own weight. These results bridge mechanical logic with EM information processing, establishing a universal physical paradigm for constructing low-power, highly robust coding metasurfaces resilient to extreme environments.

TL;DR: This paper presents a design framework for asymmetric Janus nanoparticles that optimize both optical and thermal properties, showing potential applications in photothermal therapies and nanophotonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the effectiveness of plasmonic photothermal therapies requires materials with controlled optical and thermal properties. Asymmetric nanostructures could enhance therapeutic outcomes by delivering heat asymmetrically.

Method: The study combines theoretical modeling (generalized Mie theory) with computational simulations (FEM and FDTD). A multi-objective figure of merit is defined to balance absorption efficiency and thickness, while a thermal gain parameter assesses energy densification and thermal asymmetry.

Result: The optimized asymmetric structure, with parameters (36 nm, 5 nm, 40 nm, 70°), achieves a 20-23°C temperature rise, 67% thermal focus to the upper hemisphere, and 50% focusing enhancement compared to symmetric designs.

Conclusion: This design offers a geometrically simple yet effective approach for achieving thermal asymmetry and high efficiency, paving the way for practical applications in nanophotonics and photothermal diagnostics.

Abstract: The rational design of Janus nanostructures that combine efficient optical absorption with controlled thermal transport is essential for advancing plasmonic photothermal therapies and related applications. Here, we introduce a theoretical and computational framework to investigate core-double-shell nanoparticles and their asymmetric version, the iris-gated core-double-shell architecture. The optical response of the structures is first evaluated using generalized Mie theory and subsequently validated through FEM and FDTD simulations, ensuring a consistent description of their electromagnetic and thermal behavior. To systematically map the space of variables, we defined a multi-objective figure of merit that integrates absorption efficiency, absorption cross section, and polymer-layer thickness. Furthermore, we define a thermal gain parameter that quantifies energy densification and complements the analysis of thermal directionality. Our results reveal a near-optimal configuration with parameters ($r_c$, $δ_{Au}$, $δ_p$, $θ$)=(36 nm, 5 nm, 40 nm, 70$°$), capable of producing a temperature rise of 20-23 $°$C, with 67% of the thermal fluz directed toward the upper hemispace and yielding 50% focusing enhancement relative to the symmetric case. This design preserves geometric simplicity and high symmetry while delivering robust thermal asymmetry, thereby facilitating experimental implementation. Beyond photothermal therapies, the proposed methodology constitutes a versatile platform for the rapid screening and optimization of layered nanostructures, adaptable to diverse materials, excitation wavelengths, and functional objectives in nanophotonics.

Abstract: Precise knowledge of resonator dispersion, from both geometric and material contributions, is essential for reliable high-performance nonlinear integrated photonics devices, such as optical parametric oscillators, frequency doublers, and integrated optical frequency combs. However, direct measurements at the fabrication level provide limited knowledge, whether through destructive cross-section imaging or non-destructive ellipsometry, while complete optical characterization that enables precise dispersion metrology is time-consuming and poorly suited for mass-scale foundry fabrication. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework to solve three complementary problems: (i) predicting resonator geometric dimensions, (ii) identifying the correct material dispersion, and last, but not least, (iii) precisely reconstructing the integrated dispersion spectrum directly from ring dimensions. These three neural networks together enable both inverse and forward characterization of microring resonators. Using numerically generated datasets based on Sellmeier-type material models, we demonstrate <1 nm ring dimension prediction accuracy without noise, <8 nm prediction accuracy with ~45 dispersion samples under a realistic frequency measurement noise level (50 MHz), and ~16 nm prediction accuracy at a higher noise level (200 MHz). The Sellmeier model classification exceeds 99% accuracy in all cases. Importantly, dispersion sampled far from the pump resonances proves most informative, reducing full-spectrum characterization requirements. The forward-prediction network reconstructs dispersion spectra from the ring dimensions with high accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of machine learning applied to dispersion data as a rapid, non-destructive tool for wafer-scale quality control and process monitoring in photonic foundries.

Abstract: A common approach to reduce the linewidth of a laser is an increase of its resonator length. In large gas lasers, however, the frequency spacing between longitudinal modes of the resonator easily becomes significantly smaller than the Doppler-broadened width of the gain profile. As a consequence, the laser might operate on a multitude of modes simultaneously, or jump between modes. Such unstable operation cannot be tolerated in metrological or sensing applications, such as ring laser gyroscopes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method to establish stable operation on a chosen mode index by optically steering the ring laser to a desired mode index through injection locking with an external laser. The injected mode reliably follows the external steering. Intra-cavity backscattering can even cause the counter-propagating, non-injected mode to follow the external steering as well.

Abstract: Extremely low-loss silicon nitride integrated circuits is a potential platform for a growing number of frontier applications in quantum technologies, high-performance and analog computing, nonlinear optics, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and biotechnologies. However, efficient optical modulation with a wide frequency response, high contrast, low power and scalable manufacturing remains one of the key challenges for silicon nitride integrated photonics. Here, we propose an integrated thermo-optic phase shifter with isolation trenches operating in the C-band. The fabricated thermo-optic modulator capable to achieve a $π$-phase shift shift at a power consumption of 65 mW, bandwidth of 12 kHz, and extinction ratio (ER) over 80 dB. Moreover, we systematically demonstrate its compatibility with low-loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits with microring resonators exibiting an average quality factor more than $5.9 \times 10^{6}$, which correspond to propagation loss of 0.058 dB/cm.

Abstract: Direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (dc-SQUIDs) are one of the most sensitive magnetic detectors. These sensors are extensively used in the readout of superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs), which are used for the detection of weak signals. A cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization telescope operating in 22-48 GHz is currently under developing. The TESs calorimeter of the telescope will be readout by a time-division multiplexer (TDM) SQUID readout system. We develop a two-stage dc-SQUID amplifier circuit, comprising an input-stage SQUID with 4 SQUID cells and a series SQUID array (SSA) with 100 SQUID cells. This configuration has been shown to achieve extremely high signal gain while effectively controlling system noise. We assess the system noise at $300$ $mK$ in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator (ADR). The the measured magnetic flux noise of the two-stage SQUID circuit system is approximately $0.3$ $μΦ_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at $10$ $kHz$. The current noise equivalent to the input coil of input SQUID is about $2.4$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. This result meets the low-noise readout requirements of the CMB TES and other applications with TES detectors.

Result:  我们证明了 INEC 在一定假设下成立，并为此提出了一个可能的 modify Quantum Focusing 猜想。

Conclusion:  不确定未来研究方向的具体细节，但通过这次分析，我们明确了 INEC 的潜在应用和未来研究方向。

Abstract: The Improved Quantum Null Energy Condition (INEC) was recently derived from the (restricted) quantum focusing conjecture (QFC), and is a statement about the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of field theories in Minkowski space-time. It is a stronger condition than the quantum null energy condition (QNEC), and includes the possibility of expanding or contracting geodesics. Using the properties of relative entropy and modular Hamiltonian associated with null deformation of the sphere, we show the INEC holds under an additional assumption relating the EMT to the relative entropy. Furthermore, using the QNEC and INEC as a basis, we briefly speculate about a possible modified Quantum Focusing Conjecture.

Abstract: Effective field theories consistent with quantum gravity obey surprising finiteness constraints, appearing in several distinct but interconnected forms. In this work we develop a framework that unifies these observations by proposing that the defining data of such theories, as well as the landscape of effective field theories that are valid at least up to a fixed cutoff, admit descriptions with a uniform bound on complexity. To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities. This perspective also yields mathematically well-defined notions of counting and volume measures on the space of effective theories, formulated in terms of effective field theory domains and coverings, whose finiteness is naturally enforced by the conjectures.

Abstract: This paper provides a systematic and complete study of thermal gauge theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. This work extends previous studies, which focused on pure scalar-fermion theories, to all gauge theories coupled to an arbitrary matter sector. Path-integral methods are developed to study ensemble averages and thermal Green's functions of general operators, with an arbitrary number of points, in all interacting gauge theories. These methods cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalisms. Generalized Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) conditions are obtained both in coordinate and in momentum space for operators in general representations of the Lorentz and internal symmetry group. This allows us to obtain all thermal propagators including those of gauge fields and Faddeev-Popov ghosts. By analyzing all interactions in detail, it is shown that, in perturbation theory, only the propagators are affected by the average angular momentum and the chemical potentials, the vertices remain unmodified. The paper presents fully model-independent results and can, therefore, be applied to any specific thermal field theory.

Abstract: We construct Schubert line defects in the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) with target space a partial flag manifold $X={\rm Fl}({\boldsymbol{k}};n)$, generalizing our construction for complete flag manifolds given in a companion paper arXiv:2512.19802 (part I). In the context of the 3d GLSM/quantum K-theory correspondence, the Schubert line defects are constructed as 1d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to the 3d field theory, and they flow to objects supported on Schubert varieties $X_w \subseteq X$ in the quantum K-theory. The flavored Witten index of the 1d defect is expected to compute the Chern character of $[\mathcal{O}_w]$ -- more precisely, it gives us a polynomial representative of the Schubert class in the quantum K-theory ring. We give strong evidence for this claim by showing in examples that the Witten indices of Schubert defects indeed reproduce a recently-defined set of polynomials that represent the Schubert classes in the Whitney presentation, which we call the parabolic Whitney polynomials. Moreover, upon using the quantum ring relations, we can convert these polynomials into seemingly new polynomials in the Toda presentation, which we call the parabolic quantum Grothendieck polynomials. These new polynomials specialize to known polynomials in various limits, including to the quantum Grothendieck polynomials in the case of the complete flag. In the 2d limit, our construction also realizes the Schubert classes $[X_w]$ in the quantum cohomology ring of the partial flag manifold, and the parabolic quantum Grothendieck polynomials then reduce to previously known parabolic quantum Schubert polynomials.

Abstract: We show that the type-A conformal anomaly in $2n$ dimensions follows from standard Stora-Zumino descent, starting from the Euler invariant polynomial for the Euclidean conformal group $SO(2n+1,1)$ in $6d$, thereby placing type-A anomalies on the same footing as ordinary perturbative t Hooft anomalies. We discuss implications for anomaly inflow, and t Hooft anomaly matching for the full conformal group with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In 4d, this enables the construction of a dilaton effective action matching the full type-A $SO(5,1)$ conformal anomaly.

Abstract: We introduce a family of polytopes -- in-in zonotopes -- whose boundary structure organizes the contributions to scalar equal-time correlators in flat space computed via the in-in formalism. We provide explicit Minkowski sum and facet descriptions of these polytopes, and show that their boundaries factorize into products of graphical zonotopes and lower-dimensional in-in zonotopes, thereby mimicking the factorization structure of the correlators themselves. Evaluating their canonical forms at the origin -- equivalently, calculating the volume of the dual polytope -- reproduces the correlator. Finally, in a simple example, we show that the wavefunction decomposition of the correlator corresponds to a subdivision of the dual polytope.

Abstract: We construct a field redefinition between Witten's string field theory and its deformation by the Ellwood invariant. This field redefinition is singular and does not imply physical equivalence between them. However, it allows us to formally transfer classical solutions of Witten's theory to solutions of the deformed theory. Although the resulting solutions are also generically singular and require careful examination of their physical interpretation, we show that the tachyon vacuum solution can be consistently transferred from Witten's theory to the deformed theory.

Abstract: We present the interpolating conformal algebra between the instant form dynamics (IFD) and the light-front dynamics (LFD) in $(1+1)$ dimensions, along with a $4\times4$ interpolating projective spacetime matrix representation. While there are six generators in the $(1+1)$ dimensional conformal algebra, the number of kinematic and dynamic generators dramatically changes in LFD, maximizing (minimizing) the number of kinematic (dynamic) generators to four (two) with respect to two (four) kinematic (dynamic) generators in IFD, as well as in any other forms of dynamics between IFD and LFD. It confirms and signifies the utility of LFD, saving substantial dynamical efforts in solving the $(1+1)$ dimensional quantum field theories. We also present $2\times2$ Pauli matrix representation of $(1+0)$ and $(0+1)$ conformal groups, and creation/annihilation operators of quantum simple harmonic oscillator representations of $(1+0)$ dimensional conformal groups.

Abstract: We develop a heat kernel method to compute the one-loop effective action for a general class of nonlinear electrodynamic (NLED) theories in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Working in the background field formalism, we extract the logarithmically divergent part of the effective action, the so-called induced action, corresponding to the DeWitt $a_2$ coefficient of the heat kernel. In NLED, quantisation yields non-minimal differential operators, for which standard heat kernel techniques are not immediately applicable. Considering the weak-field regime, we calculate the $a_0$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ contributions to leading order in the background electromagnetic field strength. Finally, we consider conformal NLED theories and compute the $a_0$ contribution to all orders. For this class, we comment on the role of causality being necessary and sufficient for the convergence of the exact $a_1$ and $a_2$ contributions.

Abstract: We discuss interrelations between eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonians associated with the commutative (integer ray) subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra and those of the twisted Cherednik system. In the case of $t=q^{-m}$ with natural $m$, eigenfunctions of the first system of Hamiltonians are the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions (BAFs) introduced by O. Chalykh, while eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians are twisted non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Actually, the twisted Cherednik ground state is symmetric and coincides with a peculiar symmetric BAF. We lift this correspondence to excited states, and claim that both Cherednik eigenfunctions and BAF's can be combined to produce symmetric functions, which coincide with each other and are eigenfunctions of the both DIM Hamiltonians and power sums of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians at once. This reflects the correspondence between the DIM algebra and the spherical DAHA explicitly.

Abstract: We present a fully variational locally scaled self-interaction corrected (SIC) energy functional using complex optimal orbitals. This represents an important milestone for fully variational SIC energy functionals, which have been shown to improve the prediction of the properties of atomic, molecular and solid state systems in general, in both ground and excited states. However, it depends on the system and property of the system whether it is beneficial to scale the SIC correction by a factor of one-half, which makes the application of SIC inconsistent. In the limit of a single electron the SIC exactly cancels the self interaction error, but overcorrects the error in regions of high density where there is large overlap between occupied orbitals. The newly implemented local scaling function, $z(\mathbf{r})$, which is based on an iso-orbital indicator derived from considering the kinetic energy density in the iso-electron and many electron case, and takes into account that the orbitals are complex, naturally scales the SIC correction from $0\leq z(\mathbf{r}) \leq 1$ in regions of high and low (isolated orbital) electron density. The locally scaled and fully variational SIC framework is general and applicable to atomic, molecular and solid-state systems.

Abstract: In a recent work, we introduced the foundations of an orthogonally constrained complete active space self-consistent field (OC-CASSCF) framework that produces state-specific molecular orbitals for mutually orthogonal multiconfigurational electronic states. In the present study, we extend this approach by incorporating a Newton-Raphson orbital-optimization scheme, for which we derive analytical expressions of the orbital gradient and Hessian. Furthermore, we outline a practical route toward the evaluation of analytical nuclear gradients, enabling geometry optimizations within the OC-CASSCF formalism. Benchmark calculations on the three lowest singlet states of LiH and H$_2$O molecules demonstrate a systematic improvement as compared to conventional state-averaged CASSCF, even when using modestly sized active spaces.

Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.

Abstract: Altermagnets host spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, enabling spin-polarized transport in the absence of conventional ferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been proposed as a candidate altermagnet, yet experimental reports remain conflicting, particularly between bulk-sensitive probes and thin-film measurements. Here we investigate the electronic transport properties of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films using anomalous Hall effect measurements and point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. We observe transport spin polarization and a strongly orientation-dependent anomalous Hall response, while magnetometry reveals no detectable net magnetization. The anomalous Hall effect appears only in ultrathin (110)-oriented films, consistent with symmetry-driven Néel-vector physics, and the measured transport spin polarization is systematically higher for (110)-oriented films than for (001)-oriented films, consistent with the crystallographic anisotropy of the spin-split bands. These results are consistent with altermagnetic behavior in RuO$_2$, with the experimentally accessible signatures confined to near-surface regions. They also establish superconducting transport spectroscopy as a metrology for identifying and characterizing altermagnet candidates.

Abstract: Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials.

Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases have been a central theme in condensed matter physics and beyond over the past two decades. Most efforts have focused on topological classifications of physical systems under given symmetries, while the intrinsic topology of the symmetries themselves has received much less attention. Here, we show that, in generic non-interacting spinless crystals, the spacetime inversion symmetry $PT$ naturally carries a real vector-bundle structure whose topology is characterized by Stiefel--Whitney (SW) classes. In contrast to previous work, where SW classes were used to describe the topology of real valence bundles protected by $PT$, we identify SW classes associated to the $PT$ symmetry itself. These symmetry SW classes can endow the \emph{total} real bundle of a $PT$-symmetric band structure with nontrivial topology, overturning the common assumption that the total bundle is always trivial. As a consequence, valence and conduction bands can exhibit asymmetric SW classes, in sharp contrast to the usual symmetric scenario. We further demonstrate that the symmetry SW classes provide a refined distinction between atomic insulator phases. Our results underscore the importance of treating crystal symmetries as topological objects in their own right, rather than focusing solely on the topology of energy bands.

Abstract: Landau polaritons arising from the coupling between cyclotron resonance and terahertz split-ring resonators (SRRs) have served as a central platform for exploring ultrastrong light-matter interaction for more than a decade. Over this period, a wide variety of SRR architectures, differing in size, geometry, and even material composition, have been investigated. However, the regime of near-field coupled SRRs has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate ultrastrong coupling using photocurrent spectroscopy in two prototypical near-field configurations: a SRR dimer and a topological SRR chain. The measurements reveal hybridization not only with bright resonant modes but also with optically dark modes and topological edge modes, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of the photocurrent spectroscopy. Moreover, the engineered near-field interactions allow the study of multi-mode ultrastrong coupling and the interplay between topological band structure and cavity quantum electrodynamics.

Abstract: Molecular quantum magnets adsorbed on surfaces exhibit rich spin and orbital excitations that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (STM-IETS). However, the quantitative extraction of the underlying multiorbital Hamiltonian from experimental spectra remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce molecular Hamiltonian learning, a machine learning strategy that infers the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of a single adsorbed molecule directly from the setpoint-dependence of STM-IETS data. The method leverages the systematic evolution of spectral features as the STM tip tunes the local electrostatic environment for different tip-sample distances. We demonstrate this approach on iron phthalocyanine on ferroelectric SnTe, training our algorithm on theory spectra from a realistic multiorbital model, including spin-orbit coupling, electrostatic interactions, local crystal field, and substrate effects. The algorithm, trained solely on theoretical many-body simulations, allows reconstructing Hamiltonian parameters directly from experimental spectra. Our manuscript establishes a flexible and automated strategy for Hamiltonian reconstruction from STM-IETS, transforming setpoint-dependent spectroscopy into quantitative characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale.

Abstract: The ability to manipulate and detect the parity of quantum states in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems is pivotal to realizing the promise of topological quantum computation. However, as these architectures scale toward artificial Kitaev chains with phase-control loops, local accessibility becomes restricted, constraining conventional local parity control and detection. While Andreev molecules offer a platform for non-local intervention, deterministic protocols for parity manipulation have yet to be experimentally established. Here, we demonstrate deterministic non-local control over the parity configuration of a quantum dot (QD) by electrically modulating the coherent hybridization with a spatially adjacent QD within an Andreev molecule. By systematically investigating three distinct joint parity configuration regimes in the elastic co-tunneling limit, we experimentally uncover the operational conditions for this non-local control. In conjunction with theoretical simulations establishing a global phase diagram, we identify a set of universal selection rules governing parity transitions, dictated by the symmetry-imposed interplay between the joint parity configuration and the dominant inter-dot coupling mechanism (elastic co-tunneling vs. crossed Andreev reflection). Furthermore, we establish the supercurrent, directly signaled by zero-bias conductance peaks, as an intrinsic, sensor-free probe of the parity configuration, obviating the need for auxiliary charge sensors. Our results provide a validated physical framework for parity engineering, offering a key building block for scalable, multi-QD superconducting architectures.

Abstract: In this review, a more general theory of self-induced transparency (SIT) in comparison with the theory of McCall and Hahn is considered. Using the recently developed generalized perturbative reduction method (GPRM) the SIT equations are reduced to vector (coupled) nonlinear Schrodinger equations for auxiliary functions. This approach demonstrates that, unlike McCall and Hahn SIT theory in which single-component scalar breather can propagate independently, in the more general theory of SIT the second derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinate and time of the wave equation play a significant role and describe the interaction of two scalar SIT breathers forming a coupled pair. This is a vector 0πpulse of SIT - a two-component vector breather oscillating with the sum and difference of frequencies and wave numbers. The profile, parameters and properties of this pulse differ significantly from the characteristics of the McCall and Hahn pulses.
  Using GPRM it is shown that besides the scalar soliton and the scalar breather, the vector $0π$ pulse is also a universal nonlinear wave, arising in virtually all areas of physics where nonlinear phenomena are described by nonlinear equations containing second-order and higher-order derivatives. A number of such nonlinear equations are presented. Among them almost all well known nonlinear equations, as well as the general fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation and the sixth-order generalized Boussinesq-type equations.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a dual-switch mechanism in bilayer VS2, a room-temperature Fe-AFM system, enabling electrical and magnetic control of a layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). First-principles calculations reveal that interlayer sliding breaks spatial inversion symmetry, inducing a switchable out-of-plane Fe polarization that coexists with interlayer AFM. The spin-orbit coupled valley polarization can be reversibly switched either by Fe polarization reversal or by a magnetic-field-induced spin-flip transition. The Berry curvature exhibits both valley-contrasting and layer-locked characteristics, which underpin a switchable Hall response. Notably, electric and magnetic switching are functionally equivalent in modulating valley, layer, and spin indices, revealing strong magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a multidegree-of-freedom operational paradigm in 2D multiferroics and opens a viable design pathway toward multi-state memory and spin-valleytronic logic devices.

Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric (FE) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders in twodimensional (2D) materials provides a promising avenue for the nonvolatile control of coupled spin and valley degrees of freedom, a capability central to advancing spinvalleytronics. However, realizing a single material system where these quantum states can be independently and reversibly manipulated by distinct stimuli, a prerequisite for multifunctional devices, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a dual-switch mechanism in bilayer VS2, a room-temperature FE-AFM system, that enables electrical and magnetic control of a layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). First-principles calculations reveal that interlayer sliding breaks spatial inversion symmetry, inducing a switchable out-of-plane FE polarization that coexists with interlayer AFM. The spin-orbit coupled valley polarization can be reversibly switched either by FE polarization reversal or by a magnetic-field-induced spin-flip transition, confirming the existence of electrically and magnetically addressable valley states.

Conclusion: 通過莫里e crystal實現了 correlated crystals for bosons

Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions can drive electrons to crystallize into a Wigner lattice. Achieving the bosonic analogue - a crystal of excitons - has remained elusive due to their short lifetimes and weaker interactions. Here, we report the observation of a thermodynamically stable exciton crystal in an excitonic insulator coupled to a moiré potential. Using an electron-hole bilayer composed of a monolayer MoSe2 and a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, we construct a tunable extended Bose-Hubbard model with electrical control over exciton and charge doping in thermal equilibrium. Optical spectroscopy reveals spontaneous crystallization of long-lived excitons at one exciton filling per three moiré sites, evidenced by strong Umklapp scattering peaks in the optical spectrum. Exciton transport measurements further show a pronounced exciton resistance peak at the same filling, consistent with suppressed exciton hopping in a crystalline phase. When doped away from net charge neutrality, this moiré electron-hole bilayer can host new correlated insulating phases where dipolar excitonic insulators form on top of the background of a hole Mott insulator or generalized Wigner crystals in the moiré superlattice. These findings establish moiré excitonic insulators as a versatile platform for realizing correlated crystalline phases of bosons and fermions.

Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of an atomic spin diode. Our proposed system consists of two magnetic adatoms deposited on the surface of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. A local s-d type coupling between the local spins and the spins of the electrons induces a non-local Ruderman-Kittel-Kazuya-Yoshida type interaction and a Dzyalonshinskii-Moriya interaction, in addition to dissipative interactions, between the spins. We derive the effective action for the spins using the Keldysh formalism. From the effective action, we also derive equations of motion for the spins which are shown to be of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) type, and give expressions for the effective field and Gilbert damping which appear in this equation. From our microscopic theory, we find that for an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the vector connecting the two atoms, the magnitude of the field and the distance between the atoms can always be tuned to engender perfectly diodic coupling. Our findings may pave the way to experimental realisation of atomic spin diodes.

Abstract: In recent years, nonlinear transport phenomena have garnered significant interest in both theoretical explorations and experiments. In this work, we utilize the semi-classical wave packet theory to calculate disorder-induced second-order transport coefficients: second-order electrical ($σ$), thermoelectric ($α$), and thermal ($κ$) coefficients, capturing the interplay between side-jump and skew-scattering contributions in systems with time-reversal symmetry. Using a topological insulator model, we quantitatively characterize the Fermi-level dependence of these second-order transport coefficients by explicitly including Coulomb impurity potentials. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationships between these coefficients, establishing the second-order Mott relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law induced by disorder. This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework elucidating the nonlinear thermoelectric transport mechanisms in quantum material systems.

Abstract: The band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene can be tuned using double-gated transistors to apply a perpendicular electric field that generates an interlayer potential energy difference $Δ$. Dielectric breakdown limits the operation of conventional devices to the $Δ\ll t_\perp \simeq 360$ meV regime. We employ double ionic gating to reach fields past $ 1$ V/nm, for which $Δ> t_\perp$. We find that for $Δ\simeq t_\perp$, the evolution of the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) peak as a function of applied gate voltages undergoes a sharp change in slope, exhibiting a pronounced "knee". Increasing $Δ$ past the "knee" results in an unusual evolution transport properties: the peak in $R_{xx}$ decreases in magnitude, it exhibits a splitting concomitant with multiple sign reversals of the Hall resistance, and hysteresis in the peak position emerges. We explain the observed phenomenology in terms of in-gap bound states, whose energy strongly depends on the perpendicular electric field, and crosses the mid-gap level for sufficiently large $Δ> t_\perp$. The phenomenon causes large changes in the electronic density of in-gap states that profoundly affect the evolution of the chemical potential. Our experimental results and their interpretation reveal unique aspects of the physics of in-gap states in Bernal bilayer graphene and demonstrate that double ionic gating enables investigating the large-$Δ$ regime, which has remained experimentally inaccessible so far.
