Conclusion: 该研究通过实验验证了 BKT 相变中 Order Parameter 的统计特性，闭合临界点，以及更高阶矩的普适行为，-door foundation 对临界现象和相变动力学提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Fluctuations are an intrinsic feature of many-body systems, and their full statistical distributions reveal a wealth of information about the underlying physics. Of particular interest are non-Gaussian, extreme-value statistics that arise when nontrivial correlations and criticality dominate over the central limit theorem. Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments.

### [2] [Critical speed of a binary superfuid of light](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16005)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超流体的临界速度在光量子流体中的应用，可能对光子学和量子流体动力学有重要贡献。

Method: 使用线性响应理论和非线性Schrödinger方程来推导临界速度，结合数值模拟来验证。

Result: 在弱障碍情况下，临界速度由密度和自旋波利比乌斯模式决定，而障碍变强时，临界速度由强椭圆条件决定。数值模拟显示，障碍不同（硬或软）会引发不同的超流体行为变化。

Conclusion: 2D二元光量子流体的临界速度通过不同条件和障碍类型决定了其超流体性质的变化。

Abstract: We theoretically study the critical speed for superfluid flow of a two-dimensional (2D) binary superfluid of light past a polarization-sensitive optical obstacle. This speed corresponds to the maximum mean flow velocity below which dissipation is absent. In the weak-obstacle regime, linear-response theory shows that the critical speed is set by Landau's criterion applied to the density and spin Bogoliubov modes, whose relative ordering can be inverted due to saturation of the optical nonlinearity. For obstacles of arbitrary strength and large spatial extent, we determine the critical speed from the conditions for strong ellipticity of the stationary hydrodynamic equations within the hydraulic and incompressible approximations. Numerical simulations in this regime reveal that the breakdown of superfluidity is initiated by the nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs for an impenetrable obstacle, and of Jones-Roberts soliton-type structures for a penetrable obstacle. Beyond superfluids of light, our results provide a general framework for the critical speed of 2D binary nonlinear Schrödinger superflows, including Bose-Bose quantum mixtures.

### [3] [High-Frequency Switching in Superparamagnetic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions by Enhancing Damping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15315)
*Qi Jia,Jian-Ping Wang*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 研究显示，增强磁阻在磁单层天线结构（sMTJs）中的下降加快了随机开关速度，同时电势控制（VCEC）比磁阻控制（STT）更适合高频应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着微电子技术的快速发展，计算机芯片中的随机数生成和概率计算变得越来越重要。

Method: 使用宏观旋磁模拟，系统地研究了磁阻下降对热开关阈值的影响，比较了自旋传输转矩和电势控制两种调节机制。

Result: 增强的磁阻下降加快开关速度，使得STT引发的随机开关被抑制，VCEC通过改变能垒形状而非依赖自旋转矩实现了高效率控制。

Conclusion: 磁阻下降对sMTJs中的随机开关行为至关重要，VCEC的自立性使其更适合高频应用。

Abstract: Superparamagnetic magnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) are promising components for true random number generation and probabilistic computing. Achieving high-frequency fluctuation while maintaining reliable control over output level is critical for applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of magnetic damping in regulating thermal switching rates using macrospin simulations. We show that enhanced damping accelerates the switching rate by increasing the escape rate over the energy barrier. We further compare two control mechanisms: spin-transfer torque (STT) and voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC). Our results reveal that STT-based switching is strongly suppressed under high damping, whereas VCEC, by reshaping the energy landscape without relying on torque-driven dynamics, retains high control efficiency. These findings suggest that enhanced damping not only enables faster stochastic switching in sMTJs but also makes VCEC inherently better suited than STT for high-frequency applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高电场下β-Ga2O3光电探测器的增强型光探测特性，探索在恶劣环境下高电压和光学感知的应用。

Method: 在5.6μm厚的β-Ga2O3上进行层状掺杂处理，并通过连续波445nm光照进行表征。

Result: 在大约0.67 MV/cm的阈值电场下，光电探测器从线性进入非线性行为，导致光电流增加约20倍。区域场局部化和快速的乘载效应通过TCAD仿真进一步确认。

Conclusion: β-Ga2O3复合层在高 Field 下具备可见光增强型光探测性能。在无需深紫外线（DUV）激发的情况下，提供了 filed-tunable 的增强型光探测器的可行方案。

Abstract: Photoconductive devices based on ultra-wide-bandgap (UWBG) materials offer a promising pathway toward compact, high-voltage (HV) optoelectronic and optical sensing in harsh environments. In this Letter, we report field-tunable nonlinear photoconductive gain in vertical $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ photoconductive devices under sub-bandgap visible-light excitation. The devices were fabricated on a $5.6\,μ\text{m}$-thick nitrogen-doped semi-insulating $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ epilayer grown on a conductive Sn-doped substrate and characterized under $445\,\text{nm}$ continuous-wave illumination. A distinct transition from linear to nonlinear photoconductive behavior is observed at a threshold electric field of approximately $0.67\,\text{MV/cm}$, resulting in an approximately $20\times$ enhancement in photocurrent. Complementary TCAD simulations indicate strong electric-field localization and a rapid increase in impact-ionization generation at high bias, suggesting that impact-ionization--assisted carrier multiplication contributes to the observed gain. These results demonstrate a high-field visible-light photoconductive detection mode in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ enabled by defect-assisted transport, providing a pathway toward field-tunable gain photodetectors operating without deep-ultraviolet (DUV) excitation.

### [5] [On $\sqrt{T\overline{T}}$ deformed pathways: CFT to CCFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15376)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We discuss the marginal $\sqrt{T\overline{T}}$ deformation of massless scalar field theories in two dimensions from a dynamical perspective. The operator flow equations for such deformations induce a particular Legendre Transformation between flowed Lagrangians and flowed Hamiltonians. The marginal deformation does not change the conformal symmetries of the theory, until some special points in the moduli space are reached, and the relativistic conformal algebra smoothly changes to the Carrollian conformal (equivalently BMS) one. We investigate this change of symmetry from both configuration space and phase space point of view, while keeping the notion of Legendre Transformation unchanged during the flow. By expanding the actions, in the extreme limits of the flow parameter, we recover the usual ``Electric'' Carroll theory and further uncover a novel ``Magnetic'' counterpart. We discuss the intriguing geometric understanding of such dynamical maps for the deformed theories, and also provide a concrete example for the same from a deformed string theory in flat space.

### [6] [Reduced superblocks at next-to-next-to-extremality for all maximally supersymmetric CFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15407)
*Mitchell Woolley*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores mixed four-point correlators of 1/2-BPS operators in $	ext{3d }	N=8$, 4d $	N=4$, and 6d $	N=(2,0)$ theories, building on results from 	extcite{Dolan:2004mu}. The authors generalize the construction of reduced correlators and generate conformal blocks using Jack polynomial expansions and channel equations. The reduced blocks provide new insights and extensions to known results in various dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding mixed correlators of 1/2-BPS operators in supersymmetric CFTs is a fundamental problem in conformal field theory, and this paper introduces novel techniques for their analysis and computation in different dimensions.

Method: Building on 	extcite{Dolan:2004mu}, the authors extend the construction of reduced correlators and use Jack polynomial expansions to generate conformal blocks in different channels.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of mixed correlators in these theories, introduces reduced blocks with shifted kinematics in 3d and 4d, and extends known results in 6d to non-extremal cases.

Conclusion: The techniques presented in this paper open new avenues for computing and understanding conformal blocks in mixed correlators within conformal field theories across various dimensions.

Abstract: We consider mixed four-point correlators of 1/2-BPS operators $\mathcal{O}_{k_i}$ in the maximally supersymmetric CFTs, i.e. the 3d $\mathcal{N}=8$, 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$, and 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theories. In \cite{Dolan:2004mu}, Dolan, Gallot, and Sokatchev demonstrated that four-point correlators of identical $\mathcal{O}_{k_i}$ in these SCFTs can be expressed in terms of unconstrained ``reduced correlators" $\mathcal{T}^{\{k_i\}}_{I,J}(U,V)$, $h^{\{k_i\}}_I(z)$ acted on by a $2(\varepsilon-1)^\text{nd}$ order differential operator $Δ_\varepsilon$, which is non-local in odd dimensions $d=2(\varepsilon+1)$. We generalize this construction to mixed correlators $\langle \mathcal{O}_{k_1}\mathcal{O}_{k_2}\mathcal{O}_{k_3}\mathcal{O}_{k_1+k_2+k_3-2\mathcal{E}}\rangle$ up to extremality $\mathcal{E}=2$. To construct superconformal blocks, we generalize the R-symmetry channel equations and use Jack polynomial expansions to recursively generate the full spectrum of conformal blocks in a superblock from a single channel. We observe that this channel equation can be inverted to expand $\mathcal{T}^{\{k_i\}}_{I,J}$, $h^{\{k_i\}}_I$ in ``reduced" blocks with shifted kinematics $(\tildeΔ_{12},\tildeΔ_{34})=\left(Δ_{12},Δ_{34}-2(\varepsilon-1)\right)$. These reduced blocks reproduce what is known in 4d, generalize the known $\langle \mathcal{O}_{2}\mathcal{O}_{2}\mathcal{O}_{k}\mathcal{O}_{k}\rangle$ case in 6d, and offer a novel result in 3d.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct four-dimensional de Sitter space as an excited state, rather than as a vacuum configuration, in type IIB, heterotic SO(32), and heterotic E_8 \times E_8 string theories. This framework provides a mechanism to evade vacuum-based no-go theorems for de Sitter solutions in string theory. Starting from a generic M-theory configuration, we obtain de Sitter isometry in the dual string theories through appropriate dynamical duality sequences in the late-time limit. The excited state, identified as a Glauber-Sudarshan state, is constructed as the expectation value of the metric operator in M-theory using path-integral techniques.
  We further analyze the conditions required for the existence of a well-defined effective field theory description and show that these conditions are equivalent to the Null Energy Condition for a (3+1)-dimensional FLRW cosmology. Finally, we investigate constraints arising from axionic cosmology and demonstrate how the time-dependent solutions are modified when experimental bounds on the axionic coupling constant are taken into account.
  This article serves as a computational companion to sections 3 and 4 of the paper https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.03798.

### [8] [Extended symmetry of the Maxwell theory with a gauge coupling constant as a conserved charge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15592)
*Sojeong Cheong,Myungseok Eune,Wontae Kim,Mungon Nam*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores treating coupling constants as conserved charges through the use of auxiliary fields in covariant actions, but discovers that this approach breaks local symmetries, such as in Maxwell theory.

motivation: The motivation is theoretical -- exploring the relationship between symmetry and conservation in gauge theories, and establishing a formalism to restore these symmetries.

method: The authors use a Hamiltonian analysis on Maxwell theory with auxiliary fields, identify second-class constraints, and apply the BFT formalism to restore local symmetries.

result: While local symmetries are restored, additional conserved charges are not introduced, indicating that the original theory is a gauge-fixed version of the extended theory.

conclusion: The work provides insights into the role of auxiliary fields in preserving symmetry at the expense of introducing more complex theories, with implications for understanding gauge symmetry in extended systems.

The motivation is theoretical -- exploring the relationship between symmetry and conservation in gauge theories, and establishing a formalism to restore these symmetries.

Method: The authors use a Hamiltonian analysis on Maxwell theory with auxiliary fields, identify second-class constraints, and apply the BFT formalism to restore local symmetries.

Result: While the local symmetries are restored via the BFT formalism, no additional conserved charges are introduced. This suggests that the original theory is a gauge-fixed version of the extended theory with enhanced symmetry structure.

Conclusion: The paper provides a detailed analysis of the role of auxiliary fields in preserving gauge symmetry, highlighting that while local symmetries can be restored through the BFT formalism, this does not come at the cost of introducing new conserved charges. The result implies that the original theory, before gauge fixing, is embedded within a larger, symmetric framework where the symmetries are realized on-shell but not off-shell. This offers a deeper understanding of how auxiliary fields and gauge fixing interplay in maintaining the structure of gauge theories.

Abstract: It has been proposed that any coupling constant in a covariant action
  can be treated as a conserved charge by promoting the coupling constant to auxiliary fields, typically realized by a scalar field paired with a
  higher-form gauge field. However, the procedure may break local symmetries,
  which can be explicitly shown in a simpler setting such as Maxwell theory.
  The Hamiltonian analysis of Maxwell theory with the auxiliary fields
  reveals that some of the constraints are second-class. Applying the BFT formalism, we restore the broken local symmetries and obtain
  a fully symmetric action defined on an extended configuration space. Despite the restoration of the local symmetries, no additional conserved charges are associated with the recovered symmetries.
  Consequently, the original theory turns out to be the gauge-fixed version of the
  extended theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study holographic defect conformal field theories which are dual to probe branes with bottom-up methods. First we determine the embedding of codimension-1 probe branes in AdS space. Then we compute defect one and two-point correlation functions of heavy scalar operators at strong coupling. In particular, we use geodesic approximations to compute scalar two-point functions across the defect, reflected two-point functions, and ambient channel two-point functions. In appropriate limits, our results agree with the boundary operator expansion (BOE) and the operator product expansion (OPE).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a spacetime obtained from the semi-classical backreaction computed via the Thermofield dynamics approach in the Poincare patch of de Sitter spacetime. The resulting bulk equation takes the Whittaker form and we examine two distinct applications. At leading order, the co-moving curvature perturbations are shown to match a constant-roll model in the frozen attractor regime, corresponding to a UV enhancement of the spectrum with $n_S \sim 2$. In the holographic context, we compute the CFT two-point function at the future boundary, and away from it we construct the flow-equation of the dual QFT that matches beta-function of the Sp(N ) model in three dimensions.

Abstract: We define Deligne-Beilinson (DB) cohomology on a cubic lattice and use it to formulate and analyze lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory at even levels. The continuum DB cohomology provides a refined mathematical framework for continuum $U(1)$ connections constructed in a patchwise manner. The lattice DB cohomology we construct retains many essential properties of the continuum DB cohomology and naturally incorporates a notion of self-linking number. The lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action formulated using the lattice DB cohomology is expressed as a simple quadratic form via the star product, which naturally exhibits level quantization. Framed Wilson lines respecting staggered symmetry are defined in a gauge-invariant manner, and their expectation values are shown to be given by the self-linking number, as follows from completing the square. Using the lattice Hodge decomposition, we explicitly characterize the DB cohomology on a three-dimensional cubic toroidal lattice and present a gauge-fixed, rigorous path integral for the lattice Chern-Simons theory. To regulate divergences in the lattice Chern-Simons path integral arising from staggered symmetry, we introduce a small Maxwell term. The resulting error is controlled by the linear order in the small Maxwell coupling.

Conclusion: 该研究在 AdS/CFT 对应中提供了一个新的证据，展示了四点函数可以通过五点函数的极限来计算，加强了现有理论框架的一致性。

Abstract: We bootstrap tree-level supergravity four-point correlators on AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ with one external half-BPS double-particle operator and three half-BPS single-particle operators. Our only input is the consistency of the operator product expansion of $SU(N)$ ${\cal N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory at large $N$ and large 't Hooft coupling. Even though the leading order OPE does not close on double-particle operators, but involves triple-particle operators, the CFT data of the double-particle operators, both long and protected, is sufficient to uniquely fix the correlators. We then verify that our results for the four-point correlators with one double-particle and three single-particle operators are reproduced by the appropriate double-particle limit of the five-point tree-level correlators of single-particle operators, with arbitrary Kaluza-Klein levels, recently conjectured in arXiv:2507.14124. Our study thus provides further evidence for the latter result.

Motivation: 获得一个无需正定性约束的单矩阵模型近似方法，该方法能高精度地逼近精确解或微扰结果。

Method: 基于环方程和矩的最小二乘法，文中提出了一种数值方法来确定特征值分布ρ(λ)与矩w_n的自洽对。

Result: 该 Bootstrap 近似方法通过数值计算成功地以高精度逼近了欧几里得型模型的精确解，且对莫比乌斯型模型的微扰结果也给出了合理结果。

Conclusion: 该 Bootstrap 近似方法在不依赖正定性约束的情况下，能够准确近似单矩阵模型的解，为研究非欧几何模型提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose a bootstrap approximation method for the Hermitian one-matrix model that does not rely on positivity constraints. The theoretical foundation of this method is that the one-matrix model admits an eigenvalue distribution $ρ(λ)$, and that the moments $w_n$ generated from it satisfy the loop equations. Our framework is designed to numerically determine a self-consistent pair of $ρ(λ)$ and $w_n$ that simultaneously satisfies these two requirements. In the concrete implementation, we employ a least-squares method, for which no sign problem arises in principle, and therefore the method can be formally applied also to Minkowski-type models. Actual numerical calculations show that this bootstrap approximation reproduces, with very high accuracy, the exact solutions for Euclidean-type models and the perturbative results for Minkowski-type models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.

Result: 除了能量和动量，质量也演化为完全守恒。然而，x分量的I₄x存在显著的时间漂移。数值模拟揭示了I₄x的时间漂移源是一次边界通量，这是由解及其空间导数在边界处的波动引起的。

Conclusion: 通过定义一种修正后的中心质量I₄x^mod，能够保持守恒，这为基于有限域域数值模拟中对ZK方程中心质量的描述提供了一个可靠的方法。

Abstract: We investigate conservation laws of the two-dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, a natural higher-dimensional and non-integrable extension of the Korteweg--de Vries equation. The ZK equation admits three scalar conserved quantities -- mass, momentum, and energy -- represented as $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as a vector-valued quantity $\bm{I}_4$. In high-accuracy numerical simulations on a finite double-periodic domain, most of these quantities are well preserved, while a systematic temporal drift is observed only in the $x$-component $I_{4x}$. We show that the nontrivial evolution of $I_{4x}$ originates from an explicit boundary-flux contribution, which is induced by fluctuations of the solution and its spatial derivatives at the domain boundaries. We successfully identify the source of the inaccuracy in the numerical solutions. Motivated by this analysis, we define a modified center-of-mass quantity $I_{4x}^{\mathrm{mod}}$ and demonstrate its conservation numerically for single-pulse configurations. The modified quantity thus provides a consistent conservation law for the ZK equation and yields an appropriate description of center-of-mass motion in finite-domain numerical simulations.

TL;DR: We demonstrate a technique for visualizing current flow in diamond FETs using magnetic imaging of nitrogen vacancy centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding current flow in advanced transistors for computing and sensing applications.

Method: Use hydrogen-terminated diamond surfaces creating a 2D hole gas and nitrogen vacancy centers near the surface for magnetic imaging.

Result: Imaging shows current injection at contacts and variations due to channel defects, with enhanced drain currents under light.

Conclusion: This method enables precise mapping of current distributions in FETs, aiding in understanding and optimizing next-gen transistor devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate widefield magnetic imaging of current flow in hydrogen terminated diamond field effect transistors (FETs) through in-substrate nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Hydrogen termination of the diamond surface induces a two dimensional hole gas (2DHG), while an ensemble of near surface NV centers located $ \sim 1~μm$ below the surface enables noninvasive magnetic imaging of current flow with micrometer scale spatial resolution. The FETs were electrically characterized over a range of drain source biases $V_{ds}= 0$ to $-15V$ and gate voltages,$V_{gs}= +3$ to $-9V$ followed by in situ widefield NV magnetometry during device operation. Magnetic field maps and reconstructed current density distributions directly visualize current injection at the source drain contacts and transport beneath the hBN gated channel. Magnetic field maps reveal current density variations in the channel region owing to non-uniformities or defects in the gate dielectric. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the drain current ($\sim 600-900 μA$) and a shift in the apparent threshold voltage during laser illumination, reflecting photo induced changes in channel electrostatics. By correlating gate dependent magnetic images with simultaneous electrical measurements, we directly link spatial current distributions to FET transfer characteristics, providing new insight into buried interface transport and non-uniform gating effects in the transistor channel. As the methodology is compatible with top gated FETs, it can be used to map channel current distributions with micrometer resolution in emerging channel materials, such as 2D materials and wide bandgap channels, and establish widefield NV magnetometry as a powerful platform for probing charge transport in transistors and Van der Waals dielectric heterostructures.

TL;DR: This paper describes the fabrication and operation of high-mobility field-effect devices with electron mobility exceeding 40 million cm²/(Vs). Decreased during fabrication, methods were tested to achieve better results using a flip-chip technique on sapphire substrates. The findings contribute to improved quantum transport applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on the fabrication of electronic devices with utmost electron mobility, a key property in semiconductor physics and quantum transport applications. The motivation is likely to explore new ways of achieving higher electron mobility despite fabrication-induced degradation.

Method: The authors employed a flip-chip technique involving multiple lithographic steps on a sapphire substrate to fabricate a three-terminal field-effect device. This methodic approach aims to minimize the degradation of the semiconductor quantum well.

Result: The device achieved an electron mobility of >40 million cm²/(Vs), a significant improvement over previous records. This breakthrough paves the way for new quantum transport studies and applications that previously were hindered by low mobility.

Conclusion: The successful utilization of the flip-chip method on sapphire substrates demonstrated a viable path to improving electron mobility in semiconductor devices, with potential implications for quantum transport research and related technologies.

Abstract: We report the fabrication and operation of a source-drain-gate three-terminal field-effect electronic device with an electron mobility exceeding $40\times 10^6$ cm$^2$ / (Vs). Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations.

Conclusion: 多能探针揭示了碳纳米管束中网络级量子传输的存在，为研究复杂系统特性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Quantum interference effects such as weak localization (WL) and universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) normally yield consistent electronic phase-coherence lengths in homogeneous conductors. Here we show that in individual carbon nanotube bundles exfoliated from highly conductive solution-spun fibers, different probes, including the field scales and magnitudes of WL and UCF and nonlocal magnetoconductance, lead to strikingly disparate estimates of coherence lengths. WL magnetoconductance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field yields a phase-coherence length of approximately 50 nm. In contrast, UCF amplitudes are comparable to e squared over h even for an 8 micrometer long segment, and nonlocal magnetoconductance persists across a 4 micrometer separation of electrodes, revealing phase-coherent transport over micrometer length scales within a single bundle. The coexistence of short- and long-range coherence implies that locally diffusive electrons remain partially phase-correlated among nanotubes within the same bundle. These findings challenge the conventional single-scale picture of mesoscopic coherence and establish carbon nanotube bundles as a model platform for emergent, network-level quantum transport.

Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides provides a natural binary index for information processing. Exciton-polaritons formed under strong light-matter coupling offer a promising route to overcome the limited lifetime and transport of bare valley excitons. Here we report an anomalous optical valley Hall effect in a monolayer WS2 exciton-polariton system. Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons. Our results establish exciton-polaritons as a high-speed and optically accessible platform for valley transport, opening pathways towards tunable valleytronic and topological photonic devices.

Abstract: We report an experimental study of induced superconductivity in Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions. The Ge hut nanowires are grown on prepatterned SiGe ridges via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and Josephson junction devices are fabricated by contacting the nanowires with Al electrodes. Low-temperature current-bias transport measurements of the Josephson junctions are performed and the measurements show that the devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrent and excess current. The analysis of excess current indicates that the transparency of the Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions is as high as 85%. Voltage-bias spectroscopy measurements of the devices show multiple Andreev reflections up to the fourth order. With magnetic field and temperature-dependent measurements of the multiple Andreev reflections, the critical field and the critical temperature of the induced superconductivity in the Josephson junctions are extracted to be ~0.12 T and ~1.4 K. The success in introducing superconductivity into Ge hut nanowires will stimulate their applications in building advanced quantum processors.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of strain and dielectric environment in quantum emitter positioning in transition-metal dichalcogenides. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, localized states (LS) frequently appear at suspended-supported interfaces and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold. Deterministic emitter positioning benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity. A combined optical-mechanical characterization approach is developed to map structure-property relationships in 2D quantum materials at the single-emitter level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the positioning mechanism of quantum emitters is critical for advancing device applications, especially in compact, chip-compatible quantum photonics. This paper addresses a fundamental question in two-dimensional semiconductors: whether strain alone can explain quantum emitter formation and placement or if dielectric contrast also plays a significant role.

Method: The researchers combined hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase imaging to map the positions of localized states in MoSe₂ suspended on GaN pillars. They analyzed the strain and dielectric context of these LS.

Result: The study reveals that LS frequently occur at suspended-supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold. This contradicts the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation. Along high-strain ripples, LS are scarce, indicating that deterministic emitter positioning requires both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the structure-property relationship in TMDs at the single-emitter level, demonstrating that the positioning of quantum emitters is influenced by both strain and dielectric environment, and that deterministic positioning requires co-engineering of these factors.

Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) in two-dimensional semiconductors offer compact, chip-compatible sources for quantum photonics. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), nanopillars are widely used to induce localized emission, yet the underlying confinement mechanism and the relative roles of strain versus dielectric environment remain unclear. The general problem addressed here is whether strain alone explains quantum emitter formation and placement in MoSe$_2$, or whether dielectric contrast at suspended-supported interfaces is also required. Here, we combine hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase to map the positions of localized states (LS) in MoSe$_2$ suspended on GaN pillars and correlate them with bending strain and the local dielectric context. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, LS frequently occur at suspended--supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold, while being scarce along high-strain ripples. Our data indicate that deterministic emitter positioning in Mo-based TMDs benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity, rather than strain alone. More broadly, this combined optical-mechanical characterization approach provides a general framework for mapping structure-property relationships in 2D quantum materials at the single-emitter level.

### [22] [Hysteretic Excitation in Non-collinear Antiferromagnetic Spin-Torque Oscillators: A Terminal Velocity Motion Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16000)
*Hao-Hsuan Chen,Ching-Ming Lee*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study introduces a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STOs) using the Poisson Bracket formalism. It unifies spin dynamics into two complementary perspectives: vector and particle viewpoints. The framework demonstrates that rapid spin evolution stabilizes into a Rigid Body Precession (RBP) state under spin-Omnipole torque (SOT) and damping. The long-term oscillatory decay reaches a steady-state characterized by uniform spin z-components and 120-degree inter-spin locking angles. This state is precisely modeled by the Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model, where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with an effective light mass. The model accurately predicts dynamic behavior, including SOT-driven transients, hysteresis, and a dynamic phase diagram. Additionally, it identifies a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect, caused by self-resonance of relative motion variables due to coupling with center-of-mass translation in the presence of in-plane anisotropy, which contributes to the sub-critical current regime mismatch.

motivation: The paper advances the understanding of spin dynamics in AFM STO systems by introducing a new theoretical framework that unifies spin evolution across different perspectives and provides precise predictions for dynamic behavior and critical phenomena.

method: The authors employ the Poisson Bracket formalism to unify spin dynamics into vector and particle perspectives. Analytical techniques such as time-dependent transformations are used to resolve the rapid spin evolution into stable RBP states. The long-term oscillatory decay and steady-state characterization are achieved through dynamic models, and the 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect is identified by analyzing self-resonance and in-plane anisotropy effects.

result: The study successfully models NC-AFM STO systems, predicting transient dynamics, hysteresis, and an accurate dynamic phase diagram. The 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect is identified and explained in terms of coupling between relative motion and center-of-mass translation, contributing to sub-critical current regime mismatches.

conclusion: The theoretical framework provides a comprehensive understanding of AFM STO dynamics, offering precise modeling tools for predicting spin dynamics and critical phenomena in related systems.

Conclusion: A comprehensive theoretical framework was developed for NC-AFM STO dynamics, with precise modeling of key phenomena and mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).

TL;DR: This paper introduces a double-layer graphene architecture separated by ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride to suppress sample inhomogeneities and study strongly correlated electronic phenomena, achieving quantum mobility enhanced by mutual screening, observing Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations and integer and fractional quantum Hall effects at low magnetic fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate highly correlated electronic states in two-dimensional materials, particularly graphene, which has unique properties that can be tuned experimentally, and to explore fundamental physics and device applications.

Method: A theoretical approach was used, focusing on double-layer graphene separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Key parameters include carrier density, magnetic field, and electric gating. Calculations likely involve quantum transport theories, including scattering rates and density of states.

Result: Through the use of mutual screening between the layers, the authors successfully suppresses external inhomogeneity. They observe Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations at below 1 mT, integer quantum Hall features at 0.002 T, and a fractional quantum Hall plateau at 2 T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for studying strongly correlated electronic phases.

Conclusion: The successful suppression of inhomogeneity in this architecture opens a new avenue for studying quantum transport and correlated states in two-dimensional systems, with implications for both fundamental research and device applications.

Abstract: Graphene enables precise carrier-density control via gating, making it an ideal platform for studying electronic interactions. However, sample inhomogeneities often limit access to the low-density regimes where these interactions dominate. Enhancing carrier mobility is therefore crucial for exploring fundamental properties and developing device applications. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in external inhomogeneity using a double-layer graphene architecture separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for investigating strongly correlated electronic phases in graphene-based heterostructures.

Abstract: We show that a propagating Dirac electron with intrinsic spin generically carries a real--space helical conserved current, even in the absence of orbital angular momentum. Using exact Dirac eigenstates in cylindrical confinement, we demonstrate that this helical structure possesses definite handedness, persists into evanescent regions, and is characterized by a geometric helix pitch independent of the longitudinal de~Broglie wavelength. This intrinsic helical geometry enables a local geometric coupling between a propagating electron and a chiral environment, yielding chirality--dependent spin selectivity through current geometry rather than through a spin--orbit coupling term.

*Szymon Majewski,Michał Wierzbicki,Tomasz Dietl*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discusses the potential of PbSnSe/(PbSe)_{1-y}(EuS)_{y} quantum wells as a catalyst for realizing various quantum anomalous Hall phases, based on band structure and Chern number calculations. A method is proposed for handling wells grown in different crystallographic directions by accounting for the anisotropy in the material's isoenergetic surfaces. Numerical studies for ⟨111⟩-, ⟨110⟩-, and ⟨001⟩-oriented wells predict attainable Chern numbers ranging from 1 to 4, influenced by well width, Sn content, and the orientation of the projected L valleys relative to the growth direction. The study also suggests that strain compensation is necessary to achieve high-quality quantization of Hall conductance and tunable Chern numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the desire to explore and leverage topological materials, such as group IV-VI topological crystalline insulators, for applications in quantum anomalous Hall effect, which has implications in quantum computing, spintronics, and other advanced electronic devices.

Method: The method involves a basis transformation for the multiband k·p Hamiltonian to handle quantum wells grown in arbitrary crystallographic directions. The framework explicitly considers the anisotropy of the material's isoenergetic surfaces, which is crucial for accurate modeling and prediction of the material's electronic properties.

Result: The Chern number calculations for various quantum well orientations show that the material can support Chern numbers ranging from 1 to 4, contingent on factors like well width, Sn content, and L valley orientation relative to the growth direction. Additionally, numerical studies suggest that strain compensation is essential for achieving high-quality quantization of Hall conductance, which implies tunability for practical applications.

Conclusion: This study lays the groundwork for designing and optimizing PbSnSe/(PbSe)_{1-y}(EuS)_{y} quantum wells for realizing diverse quantum anomalous Hall phases. The proposed method and predictive framework provide guidance for optimizing material parameters and structural adjustments to achieve desired electronic properties, opening up possibilities for applications in quantum electronic devices.

Abstract: Consistent with prior qualitative expectations for group IV-VI topological crystalline insulators, this work demonstrates, based on band structure and Chern number calculations, that Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se/(PbSe)$_{1-y}$(EuS)$_y$ quantum wells constitute a promising and viable platform for realizing a variety of quantum anomalous Hall phases. The proposed basis transformation procedure for the multiband $\mathit{k} \cdot \mathit{p}$ Hamiltonian enables the treatment of wells grown along arbitrary crystallographic directions while explicitly accounting for the anisotropy of the material's isoenergetic surfaces. Numerical studies of $\langle 111\rangle$-, $\langle 110\rangle$- and $\langle 001\rangle$-oriented quantum wells predict attainable Chern numbers with magnitudes ranging from $1$ to $4$, depending on the quantum well width, Sn content, and relative orientation of the four projected $\mathrm{L}$ valleys with respect to the growth direction. The results further indicate that appropriate strain compensation is required to achieve high-quality quantization of the Hall conductance.

Abstract: We theoretically predict that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can induce magnon equilibrium spin current in collinear antiferromagnets. Such a current, being a response to the effective magnon vector potential, can be considered as magnon analog of the superconducting supercurrent or the persistent current. Large amplitude of the predicted effect may compensate for the smallness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, making the equilibrium spin currents to be experimentally observed. We suggest that external electric field can play the role of effective flux magnons interact with and propose an experiment based on the interference of magnons in the ring geometry as a verification of the concept.

TL;DR: The ALICE Time Projection Chamber's custom FPGA-based pipeline processes 3 TB/s raw Pb-Pb collision data into 900 GB/s for real-time HEP analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High interaction rates in LHC Run 3 require real-time processing of massive data for Pb-Pb collisions, pushing detector systems to their limits.

Method: An FPGA-based pipelining approach is developed with a highly parallel common-mode correction using streaming data, combined with pedestal subtraction, ion-tail filtering, zero suppression, and dense packing.

Result: The system successfully processes 3 TB/s raw data into 900 GB/s, enabling real-time analysis even under extreme conditions.

Conclusion: This system represents a robust and efficient solution for high-bandwidth HEP data processing.

Abstract: For LHC Run 3, the ALICE Time Projection Chamber was upgraded to operate in continuous readout mode. Interaction rates of up to 50 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions require real-time processing of more than 3 TB/s of raw detector data. This requirement is met by a custom FPGA-based processing pipeline that performs the complete front-end data treatment fully in-stream, including common-mode correction, pedestal subtraction, ion-tail filtering, zero suppression, and dense data packing.
  A central element of the design is a highly parallel common-mode correction algorithm operating directly on the streaming data. It robustly identifies signal-free readout channels on a time-bin basis and applies pad-dependent scaling to compensate for local variations in capacitive coupling in the GEM readout. In combination with pedestal subtraction and ion-tail filtering, this enables accurate baseline restoration under extreme high-occupancy conditions, preventing signal loss while efficiently suppressing noise prior to zero suppression.
  The pipeline operates continuously at the full detector bandwidth and reduces the raw input rate to about 900 GB/s for Pb-Pb collisions at the target interaction rate. Overall, it represents a large-scale FPGA-based real-time signal-processing implementation for high-energy physics detector readout.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in fast-timing detectors required for the HL-LHC experiments, aiming to provide a solution through non-standard sensor designs and advanced electronics.

Method: The design of the OPTIMA multichannel board and its integration in test beam setups are detailed.

Result: The integration into test beams and initial experimental results confirming the performance metrics are presented.

Conclusion: The OPTIMA board successfully meets the requirements for fast-timing applications in high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: In the new era of HL-LHC experiments, fast-timing detectors are emerging as critical tools for background rejection. Typical requirements include a temporal hit resolution of about 50 ps, a spatial resolution of around 12 $μ$m, and radiation hardness up to $10^{17}$n$_\text{eq}$/cm$^2$. To address these challenges, the development of non-standard sensor designs and advanced fast readout electronics is required. The OPTIMA multichannel board addresses the need for testing small sensor demonstrators when they cannot yet be bonded to dedicated readout ASICs. It provides fast readout of up to 16 channels and can be integrated into various test setups, including test beam environments. This contribution presents the design of the OPTIMA board, its integration in test beams, and the first experimental results.

Abstract: Future liquid-xenon (LXe) based observatories for rare processes, such as XLZD, require testing of large components and sub-assemblies in cryogenic liquid or gaseous xenon environments. Here we present results from the stable operation of a shallow dual-phase LXe TPC with an inner diameter of 133.4\,cm and a height of 3.1\,cm in the unshielded PANCAKE platform, without underground suppression of cosmic-ray backgrounds. A total of 340\,kg of xenon was used in the experiment, of which 127\,kg constituted the active TPC mass. Measurements of the LXe purity-dependent electron lifetime and the electron drift velocity in LXe demonstrate that sensitive measurements to characterize the TPC performance are possible in a high-background environment, even with a very basic PMT-based light detection system. Improving this will straightforwardly reduce the TPC threshold, which was observed to be around 15\,keV for electronic recoils in TPC operation.

Result: The model successfully predicted impurity levels at the ppb level. This data facilitates background predictions and crystal optimization for dark matter detectors.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust method for predicting detector backgrounds and optimizing crystal production in dark matter research.

Abstract: The SABRE North experiment is developing ultra-high radiopurity NaI(Tl) detectors to investigate dark matter. To achieve this, SABRE North utilizes the technique called zone refining for NaI powder purification. This work details the mathematical model developed to describe the purification process. By comparing this model to the results of the commissioning and production runs conducted prior to crystal growth, the distribution coefficients were determined for various impurities, contained in the powder at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level. Furthermore, the synthesis of data from both zone refining and normal freezing is discussed. These findings can be used to predict the SABRE North detectors background level in the energy region-of-interest for dark matter search and to optimize the production of ultra-high purity crystals through multiple purification strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the degradation mechanisms of the gain layer in LGADs is critical for radiation-hardened detector applications, and defect-level understanding currently lacks sufficient data.

Method: The Gain-Layer Project fabricated 19050 diodes with varying concentrations of Boron, Phosphorus, Oxygen, and Carbon, and low-resistivity p-type Silicon material. The project employed I-V, C-V, SIMS, and DLTS measurements on unirradiated diodes to analyze defect formation and characterization.

Result: The study reveals insights into defect formation and the processes affecting the gain layer, providing a foundation for future research and improving defect spectroscopy techniques.

Conclusion: This comprehensive study fills a significant gap in understanding the effects of radiation on gain layers in LGADs, offering valuable data and opening new research directions in radiation tolerance for semiconductor devices.

Abstract: Gain-layer degradation from exposure to radiation limits the use of Low-Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs) in high energy particle physics detector experiments. Proper understanding of how the gain-layer is destroyed is not available on a defect level. Only measurements for materials with much lower effective doping concentrations are available. The direct study of the gain-layer is not possible with typical defect spectroscopy measurements like Thermally Stimulated Currents (TSC) and Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). To combat this problem and gain a better understanding of the processes which degrade LGADs, the Gain-Layer Project was started.
  This project produced 19050 diodes with various Boron, Phosphorus, Oxygen and Carbon concentrations. The material used is low-resistivity p-type Silicon. The effective doping concentrations are in the order of a LGAD gain-layer. These diodes will serve the defect community in the coming years for various studies. This article introduces this project with detailed descriptions of the diodes, their flavours and their processing, and reports on results from I-V, C-V, SIMS and DLTS measurements on unirradiated diodes.

Abstract: We show that quantum information scrambling can enable a generic SWAP gate between collective degrees of freedom in systems without universal local control. Our protocol combines the Hayden-Preskill recovery scheme, associated with the black hole information paradox, with quantum teleportation and runs them in parallel and in opposite directions, enabling bidirectional exchange of quantum states through global interactions alone. This approach cleanly distinguishes the roles of information spreading, entanglement, and chaos for enabling both coherent state transfer and recovery. We propose an experimental realization using the Dicke model, which can be realized in cavity-QED and trapped-ion platforms, highlighting the utility of holography in designing practical quantum gates.

Abstract: We propose a measurement-based quantum metrology protocol in a composite model, where the probe system (a spin ensemble) is coupled to an ancillary two-level system (qubit) with a general Heisenberg XXZ interaction. With an optimized and weak probe-ancilla coupling strength and a proper duration of joint evolution, the two parallel evolution paths of the probe system induced by the unconditional measurement on qubit can transform an eigenstate of the collective angular momentum operator of spin ensemble to be a two-component state with a large distance in eigenspace. The quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system of polarized states or their superposition, that could be relaxed to mixed states, can therefore manifest an exact or asymptotic quadratic scaling with respect to the probe size (spin number) $N$. The quadratic scaling behavior is found to be insensitive to the imperfect encoding operator and coupling strength. By virtue of the parity detection on the ancillary qubit or the probe system, the phase sensitivity can approach the Heisenberg limit. We suggest that the unconditional measurement on qubit could become an efficient resource to replace Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like states and squeezing Hamiltonian for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision.

Method: 我们使用多层感知机来近似连续函数，以补充Color码和Golay码的综合征测量。通过针对每种码进行解码优化，提高了解码精度。

Conclusion: 这种方法展示了通过 self-optimization 实现通用的解码自优化的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum error correction is indispensable to achieving reliable quantum computation. When quantum information is encoded redundantly, a larger Hilbert space is constructed using multiple physical qubits, and the computation is performed within a designated subspace. When applying deep learning to the decoding of quantum error-correcting codes, a key challenge arises from the non-uniqueness between the syndrome measurements provided to the decoder and the corresponding error patterns that constitute the ground-truth labels. Building upon prior work that addressed this issue for the toric code by re-optimizing the decoder with respect to the symmetry inherent in the parity-check structure, we generalize this approach to arbitrary stabilizer codes. In our experiments, we employed multilayer perceptrons to approximate continuous functions that complement the syndrome measurements of the Color code and the Golay code. Using these models, we performed decoder re-optimization for each code. For the Color code, we achieved an improvement of approximately 0.8% in decoding accuracy at a physical error rate of 5%, while for the Golay code the accuracy increased by about 0.1%. Furthermore, from the evaluation of the geometric and algebraic structures in the continuous function approximation for each code, we showed that the design of generalized continuous functions is advantageous for learning the geometric structure inherent in the code. Our results also indicate that approximations that faithfully reproduce the code structure can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of reoptimization. This study demonstrates that the re-optimization technique previously shown to be effective for the Toric code can be generalized to address the challenge of label degeneracy that arises when applying deep learning to the decoding of stabilizer codes.

Abstract: Quantum channel capacities are fundamental to quantum information theory. Their definition, however, does not limit the computational resources of sender and receiver. In this work, we initiate the study of computational quantum capacities. These quantify how much information can be reliably transmitted when imposing the natural requirement that en- and decoding have to be computationally efficient. We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm. Our results demonstrate that the natural requirement of computational efficiency can radically alter the limits of quantum communication.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Certain families of quantum mechanical models can be described and solved efficiently on a classical computer, including qubit or qudit Clifford circuits and stabilizer codes, free-boson or free-fermion models, and certain rotor and GKP codes. We show that all of these families can be described as instances of the same algebraic structure, namely quadratic functions over abelian groups, or more generally over (super) Hopf algebras. Different kinds of degrees of freedom correspond to different "elementary" abelian groups or Hopf algebras: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ for qubits, $\mathbb{Z}_d$ for qudits, $\mathbb{R}$ for continuous variables, both $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ for rotors, and a super Hopf algebra $\mathcal F$ for fermionic modes. Objects such as states, operators, superoperators, or projection-operator valued measures, etc, are tensors. For the solvable models above, these tensors are quadratic tensors based on quadratic functions. Quadratic tensors with $n$ degrees of freedom are fully specified by only $O(n^2)$ coefficients. Tensor networks of quadratic tensors can be contracted efficiently on the level of these coefficients, using an operation reminiscent of the Schur complement. Our formalism naturally includes models with mixed degrees of freedom, such as qudits of different dimensions. We also use quadratic functions to define generalized stabilizer codes and Clifford gates for arbitrary abelian groups. Finally, we give a generalization from quadratic (or 2nd order) to $i$th order tensors, which are specified by $O(n^i)$ coefficients but cannot be contracted efficiently in general.

Abstract: We investigate the dissipative dynamics of quantum population and coherence among different network topologies of a quantum network using a quantum spin model coupled to a thermal bosonic reservoir. Our study proceeds in two parts. First, we analyze a small network of Ising spins embedded in a large dissipative bath, modeled via the Lindblad master equation, where temperature arises naturally from system-bath coupling. This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure. Our results highlight how dissipative quantum dynamics depend on network topology, providing insight into the coherent dynamics of entangled states in networks. These results may be extended to dynamics in complex systems such as opinion propagation in social models, epidemiology, and various condensed-phase and biological systems.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes can be implemented by measuring only low-weight checks, making them compatible with noisy quantum hardware and central to the quest to build noise-resilient quantum computers. A fundamental open question is how constraints on check weight limit the achievable parameters of qLDPC codes. Here, we study stabilizer and subsystem codes with constrained check weight, combining analytical arguments with numerical optimization to establish strong upper bounds on their parameters. We show that stabilizer codes with checks of weight at most three cannot have nontrivial distance. We also prove tight tradeoffs between rate and distance for broad families of CSS stabilizer and subsystem codes with checks of weight at most four and two, respectively. Notably, our bounds are applicable to general qLDPC codes, as they rely only on check-weight constraints without assuming geometric locality or special graph connectivity. In the finite-size regime, we derive numerical upper bounds using linear programming techniques and identify explicit code constructions that approach these limits, delineating the landscape of practically relevant qLDPC codes with tens or hundreds of physical qubits.

Motivation: The paper explores the efficiency of different tensor network states for quantum many-body simulations.

Method: Compared large systems in 2D and 3D using TTNS and MPS under the framework of an entanglement (log-)area law.

Result: For large systems in 3D, MPS simulations are more efficient than TTNS.

Conclusion: While TTNS are effective for 2D systems, their efficiency diminishes in 3D compared to MPS.

Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.

TL;DR:  demonstrated a quantum algorithm for high-dimensional dissipative quantum dynamics achieving an exponential separation in particle number and quartic speedup in epsilon compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  understanding and simulating high-dimensional dissipative quantum dynamics is challenging for classical computers, as the complexity often scales exponentially with the number of particles. this paper aims to demonstrate a quantum advantage in this domain.

Method:  the paper introduces a quantum algorithm called Gaussian linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (Gaussian-LCHS) to simulate the Fokker-Planck equation for non-unitary dynamics. this method uses a sum-of-squares representation and block encoding to efficiently compute reaction rates. the authors also developed a novel technique to estimate matrix elements without suffering from exponential decay in success probability.

Result:  the proposed quantum algorithm achieves a runtime of O((η^5/2 sqrt(tβ) α_V + η^3/2 sqrt(t/β) N)/ε), which provides an exponential separation in the number of particles η, a quartic speedup in the error ε, and a quadratic speedup in time t compared to classical algorithms.

Conclusion:  This work demonstrates a rigorous pathway toward quantum advantage in simulating high-dimensional dissipative quantum dynamics, offering exponential improvements in scaling compared to classical methods, as evidenced by the O(1/ε) runtime enhancement.

Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation models rare events across sciences, but its high-dimensional nature challenges classical computers. Quantum algorithms for such non-unitary dynamics often suffer from exponential {decay in} success probability. We introduce a quantum algorithm that overcomes this for computing reaction rates. Using a sum-of-squares representation, we develop a Gaussian linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (Gaussian-LCHS) to represent the non-unitary propagator with $O\left(\sqrt{t\|H\|\log(1/ε)}\right)$ queries to its block encoding. Crucially, we pair this with {a} novel technique to directly estimate matrix elements without exponential decay. For $η$ pairwise interacting particles discretized with $N$ plane waves per degree of freedom, we estimate reactive flux to error $ε$ using $\widetilde{O}\left((η^{5/2}\sqrt{tβ}α_V + η^{3/2}\sqrt{t/β}N)/ε\right)$ quantum gates, where $α_V = \max_{r}|V'(r)/r|$. For non-convex potentials, the {sharpest classical} worst-case analytical bounds to simulate the related overdamped Langevin {equation} scale as $O(te^{Ω(η)}/ε^4)$. This {implies} an exponential separation in particle number $η$, a quartic speedup in $ε$, and quadratic speedup in $t$. While specialized classical heuristics may outperform these bounds in practice, this demonstrates a rigorous route toward quantum advantage for high-dimensional dissipative dynamics.

Abstract: Color center spins in 4H-SiC offer a rare combination of wafer-scale materials maturity with long spin coherence and chip-level photonics, making them promising building blocks for scalable quantum technologies. In particular, the silicon vacancy hosts an S=3/2 ground state, a native qudit that enables compact encodings and subspace-selective control, but also introduces spectator transitions: short, detuned pulses can coherently drive non-addressed level pairs and create crosstalk. Here we use broadband Ramsey interferometry to reveal and quantify such spectator-transition crosstalk. Experimentally, the Ramsey Fourier spectra display multiple lines beyond the addressed single-quantum transition. Analytically, we map each line to a pairwise energy difference between qudit levels of the rotating-frame Hamiltonian and assign its weight via compact amplitudes set by the prepared state and the microwave pulse parameters, predicting a deterministic six-branch structure. Numerical time-domain propagation with the experimental sampling reproduces the detuning map, and the measured peak positions coincide with the analytic branch lines without frequency fitting. Together these results provide a practical, spectator-aware framework for multilevel control in the silicon vacancy qudit. The approach offers clear guidance to suppress crosstalk or, conversely, to exploit spectator lines, for example as additional constraints for in situ pulse calibration and for phase-sensitive quantum state and process estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in generating bright, pulsed squeezed light suitable for quantum microscopy, a technology that has gained traction in biological research but faces limitations due to noise and photodamage.

Method: The researchers utilized a chi^2 optical parametric amplification process within a waveguide to create high-level squeezed light. The technique involves processing optical power compatible with nonlinear microscopy, achieving measurements of -3.2~dB of bright squeezing and -3.6~dB of vacuum squeezing, which corrects to -15.4 dB net squeezing.

Result: The study reports the highest measured bright amplitude pulsed squeezing to date, which surpasses previous attempts. This advancement enhances the precision of nonlinear microscopy, particularly in biological studies, by surpassing quantum noise limits.

Conclusion: The development of this squeezing technique marks a significant step forward in overcoming technical hurdles for quantum simulation enhancement. It broadens the applicability of quantum microscopy, particularly in fields such as material science and life sciences, where ultra-sensitive measurements are critical.

Abstract: Squeezed states of light enable enhanced measurement precision by reducing noise below the standard quantum limit. A key application of squeezed light is nonlinear microscopy, where state-of-the-art performance is limited by photodamage and quantum-limited noise. Such microscopes require bright, pulsed light for optimal operation, yet generating and detecting bright pulsed squeezing at high levels remains challenging. In this work, we present an efficient technique to generate high levels of bright picosecond pulsed squeezed light using a $χ^2$ optical parametric amplification process in a waveguide. We measure $-3.2~\mathrm{dB}$ of bright squeezing with optical power compatible with nonlinear microscopy, as well as $-3.6~\mathrm{dB}$ of vacuum squeezing. Corrected for losses, these squeezing levels correspond to $-15.4^{+2.7}_{-8.7}~\mathrm{dB}$ of squeezing generated in the waveguide. The measured level of bright amplitude pulsed squeezing is to our knowledge the highest reported to date, and will contribute to the broader adoption of quantum-enhanced nonlinear microscopy in biological studies.

Motivation: Precise atom interferometers require highly optimized pulses to overcome challenges posed by experimental inhomogeneities.

Method: A novel adaptive sliced pulse design based on quantum optimal control (GRAPE) was used.

Result: The optimized pulse effectively broadens tolerance to detuning and Rabi frequency variations, enhances robustness against coupling and velocity spread, and simplifies experimental setup.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for improving atom interferometer performance under experimental complexities.

Abstract: Atom interferometers require both high efficiency and robust performance in their mirror pulses under experimental inhomogeneities. In this work, we demonstrated that quantum optimal control designed mirror pulse significantly enhance interferometer performance by using novel adaptive sliced structure. Using gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), optimized mirror pulse for a Mach-Zehnder light-pulse atom interferometer was designed by discretizing the control into non-uniform phase slices. This design broadened the tolerence to experimentally relevant variations in detuning $[-Ω_0,Ω_0]$ and Rabi frequency $[0.1\timesΩ_0,1.9\timesΩ_0]$ ($Ω_0=2π\times25$ kHz), while maintaining high transfer efficiency even when the response-time delays up to 1.6 $\rm{μs}$. The optimized pulse was found to be robust to coupling inhomogeneity and velocity spread, offering a significant improvement in robustness over conventional pulse. The adaptive pulse slicing method provides a minimalist strategy that reduces experimental complexity while enhancing robustness and scalability, offering an innovative scheme for quantum optimal control in high precision atom interferometry.

Abstract: We propose a phase-difference estimation algorithm based on the tensor-network circuit compression, leveraging time-evolution data to pursue scalability and higher accuracy on a quantum phase estimation (QPE)-type algorithm. Using tensor networks, we construct circuits composed solely of nearest-neighbor gates and extract time-evolution data by four-type circuit measurements. In addition, to enhance the accuracy of time-evolution and state-preparation circuits, we propose techniques based on algorithmic error mitigation and on iterative circuit optimization combined with merging into matrix product states, respectively. Verifications using a noiseless simulator for the 8-qubit one-dimensional Hubbard model using an ancilla qubit show that the proposed algorithm achieves accuracies with 0.4--4.7\% error from a true energy gap on an appropriate time-step size, and that accuracy improvements due to the algorithmic error mitigation are observed. We also confirm the enhancement of the overlap with matrix product states through iterative optimization. Finally, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on IBM Heron devices with Q-CTRL error suppression for 8-, 36-, and 52-qubit models using more than 5,000 2-qubit gates. These largest-scale demonstrations for the QPE-type algorithm represent significant progress not only toward practical applications of near-term quantum computing but also toward preparation for the era of error-corrected quantum devices.

Abstract: We observe a metrological advantage in phase-space sensitivity for photon-added cat and kitten states over their original forms, due to phase-space broadening from increased amplitude via photon addition, albeit with higher energy cost. Using accessible non-classical resources, weak squeezing and displacement, we construct a squeezed state and two superposed states: the squeezed cat state and the symmetrically squeezed state. Their photon-added variants are compared with parity-matched cat and KSs using quantum Fisher information and fidelity. The QFI isocontours reveal regimes where KS exhibit high fidelity and large amplitude, enabling their preparation via Gaussian operations and photon addition. Similar regimes are identified for cat states enhanced by squeezing and photon addition, demonstrating improved metrological performance. Moreover, increased amplitude and thus larger phase-space area reduces the size of interferometric fringes, enhancing the effectiveness of quantum error correction in cat codes.

Abstract: We generalize the generalized-squeezing problem to include fractional values of the squeezing order $n$. This approach allows us to determine the locations of critical points at which qualitative changes in behaviour occur and accurately predict the behaviour at these critical points, which are challenging for conventional computational methods. Based on our numerical calculations, we identify with a high degree of confidence the point at which the spectrum turns from continuous to discrete and the point at which oscillations turn from having asymptotically infinite amplitudes to finite amplitudes. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the behaviour in the large $n$ regime and provide an intuitive explanation that coincides with the numerical results.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In conventional lattice models, the dispersion relation $ω(k)$ is assumed to be a smooth function. We prove that this smoothness implies the splitting of an initially localized excitation into counter-propagating wave packets. Consequently, unsplit spreading can occur only when $ω(k)$ develops singular features, precisely what long-range interactions enable. Remarkably, this phenomenon was clearly visible in published quantum simulation experiments as early as 2014, yet it has remained unrecognized or discussed as a distinct physical effect. We show that unsplit spreading emerges in realistic open quantum systems, such as 1D and 2D subwavelength atomic arrays, where the long-lived subradiant states host effective dispersion with the required singularities. Our work establishes unsplit spreading as an experimentally accessible, smoking-gun signature of singular band structure induced by long-range physics.

Abstract: Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have promising applications in combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). We investigated the MaxCut problem in three different families of graphs using QAOA ansats with parameter transfer initialization followed by targeted single layer optimization. For 3 regular (3R), Erdos Renyi (ER), and Barabasi Albert (BA) graphs, the parameter transfer approach achieved mean approximation ratios of 0.9443 for targeted-single layer optimization as compared to 0.9551 of full optimization. It represents 98.88 percent optimal performance, with 8.06 times computational speedup in unweighted graphs. But, in weighted graph families, optimal performance is relatively low (less than 90 percent) for higher nodes graph, suggesting parameter transfer followed by targeted-single-layer optimization is not ideal for weighted graph families, however, we find that for some weighted families (weighted 3-regular) this approach works perfectly. In 8.92 percent test cases, targeted single layer optimization outperformed the full optimization, indicating that complex parameter landscape can trap full optimization in sub-optimal local minima. To mitigate this inconsistency, ridge (L2) regularization is used to smoothen the solution landscape, which helps the optimizer to find better optimum parameters during full optimization and reduces these inconsistent test cases from 8.92 percent to 3.81 percent. This work demonstrates that efficient parameter initialization and targeted-single-layer optimization can improve the efficiency of QAOA with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Simulating noiseless quantum dynamics classically faces a fundamental dilemma: tensor-network methods become inefficient as entanglement saturates, while Pauli-truncation approaches typically rely on noise or randomness. To close the gap, we propose the Low-weight Pauli Dynamics (LPD) algorithm that efficiently approximates local observables for short-time dynamics in the absence of noise. We prove that the truncation error admits an average-case bound without assuming randomness, provided that the state is sufficiently entangled. Counterintuitively, entanglement--usually an obstacle for classical simulation--alleviates classical simulation error. We further show that such entangled states can be generated either by tensor-network classical simulation or near-term quantum devices. Our results establish a rigorous synergy between existing classical simulation methods and provide a complementary route to quantum simulation that reduces circuit depth for long-time dynamics, thereby extending the accessible regime of quantum dynamics.

TL;DR: Quantum walks can simulate Dirac particles, but some models introduce extra 'doublers' and 'pseudo-doublers' that complicate the results. We propose a new family of quantum walks that avoids these issues while still accurately simulating the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, these new walks introduce some additional low-energy solutions that aren't directly Dirac particles. By allowing a non-zero probability for staying in place, we achieve this improvement. This work is relevant for quantum computing and simulations of relativistic particles.

Motivation: Quantum walks are a promising tool for simulating relativistic particles like Dirac fermions. However, certain models introduce unwanted 'doublers' and 'pseudo-doublers' that complicate the simulations. Our goal is to develop a family of quantum walks that avoids these issues while still accurately simulating the Dirac equation. This research addresses the challenges in quantum simulation of relativistic particles and opens up new possibilities for quantum computing applications.

Method: We analyzed discrete spacetime models known as quantum walks, focusing on fermion doubling in these models. We examined both the first and second quantized versions of the walks represented by quantum cellular automata. We identified issues with spurious solutions when introducing interactions and considered the role of pseudo-doublers. We then proposed a family of quantum walks that eliminates these doublers and pseudo-doublers while still accurately simulating the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. By allowing a non-zero probability for the walker to stay in place, we achieved this improvement.

Result: We successfully developed a family of quantum walks that avoids the issues of doublers and pseudo-doublers while accurately simulating the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, these new walks introduce some additional low-energy solutions that aren't directly Dirac particles. By allowing a non-zero probability for the walker to stay in place, we achieved this improvement. This work is relevant for quantum computing and simulations of relativistic particles.

Conclusion: Quantum walks offer a powerful framework for simulating relativistic particles like Dirac fermions. While certain models introduce unwanted 'doublers' and 'pseudo-doublers,' we have developed a new family of quantum walks that eliminates these issues while still accurately simulating the Dirac equation. This research opens up new possibilities for using quantum walks in quantum computing and relativistic particle simulations.

Abstract: We consider discrete spacetime models known as quantum walks, which can be used to simulate Dirac particles. In particular we look at fermion doubling in these models, in which high momentum states yield additional low energy solutions which behave like Dirac particles. The presence of doublers carries over to the `second quantised' version of the walks represented by quantum cellular automata, which may lead to spurious solutions when introducing interactions. Moreover, we also consider pseudo-doublers, which have high energy but behave like low energy Dirac particles, and cause potential problems regarding the stability of the vacuum. To address these issues, we propose a family of quantum walks, that are free of these doublers and pseudo-doublers, but still simulate the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, there remain a small number of additional low energy solutions which do not directly correspond to Dirac particles. While the conventional Dirac walk always has a zero probability for the walker staying at the same point, we obtain the family of walks by allowing this probability to be non-zero.

Abstract: In this work the machinery of q-deformed algebras are used to enhance cryptographic security during teleportation. We use q-deformed harmonic oscillator states to develop a novel method of teleportation. The deformed states can be expressed in terms of standard oscillator states and the expressions contain certain arbitrary functions of $q$. It is the presence of these arbitrary functions that allows an enhancement of cryptographic security. The specifics are :
  (a) q-deformed Bell-like states are constructed which reduce to the usual Bell states when the deformation parameter $q\rightarrow 1$. These deformed states form an orthonormal basis for q-deformed entangled bipartite states when certain arbitrary functions of $q$ satisfy a constraint.
  (b) We discuss the generalisation of the usual teleportation protocol with non-maximally entangled states. This generalisation is then employed to construct two new protocols using q-deformed non-maximally entangled states. These states have additional parameters and these have to be shared for decryption after teleportation. Consequently, the cryptographic security is improved.

TL;DR: Quantum circuit optimization techniques are crucial for enhancing the performance of current and near-future quantum devices. This paper introduces a novel automated protocol for approximate circuit rewriting that incorporates a greedy strategy combining ZX-calculus diagrams with stochastic mixtures of identity and carefully selected over-rotations to reduce gate counts while maintaining a strict error budget. The approach yields modest reductions in random quantum circuits and substantial improvements in structured circuits like the quantum Fourier transform. Additionally, the protocol converts experimental noise into engineered random noise, outperforming other approximation methods on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve the efficiency and scalability of quantum computing by reducing the resource requirements of quantum circuits without significantly compromising their accuracy.

Method: The methodology involves refining automated optimization techniques based on the ZX-calculus by adding a greedy strategy that selectively replaces ZX-diagrams with small phase angles with stochastic mixtures of the identity and over-rotations. The process ensures that the overall gate count is reduced within a strict error budget.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol effectively reduces the number of two-qubit gates in random quantum circuits and achieves a significant reduction in structured circuits such as the quantum Fourier transform. Additionally, by converting experimental noise into deliberate random noise, the approach enhances the overall performance of quantum circuits compared to other approximation methods.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper presents a promising new direction for resource-aware automated quantum compilation by utilizing mixed-channel approximations, which can outperform traditional pure unitary channel approaches and potentially enhance future quantum circuit performance.

Abstract: Quantum circuit optimization - the process of transforming a quantum circuit into an equivalent one with reduced time and space requirements - is crucial for maximizing the utility of current and near-future quantum devices. While most automated optimization techniques focus on transforming circuits into equivalent ones that implement the same unitary, we show that substantial new opportunities for resource reduction can be achieved by (1) allowing approximate local transformations and (2) employing mixed quantum channels to approximate pure circuits. Our novel automated protocol for approximate circuit rewriting is a refined evolution of automated optimization techniques based on the ZX-calculus, where we add a greedy strategy that selectively replaces ZX-diagrams with small phase angles with stochastic mixtures of the identity and carefully chosen over-rotations, which are designed to reduce the overall gate count in expectation while staying within a strict error budget. This approach yields modest two-qubit gate count reduction in random quantum circuits, and achieves a substantial reduction in structured circuits such as the quantum Fourier transform. Fundamentally, our protocol converts experimental noise due to gate applications into deliberately engineered random noise, outperforming many other approximation methods on average. These results highlight the potential of mixed-channel approximations to enhance future quantum circuit performance, suggesting new directions for resource-aware automated quantum compilation beyond pure unitary channels.

Abstract: The maximum work extractable from a quantum system is achieved when the system is driven adiabatically. Frictional work then quantifies the difference in work output between adiabatic and non-adiabatic driving. Here we show that frictional work in a non-integrable spin chain is well-described by the diagonal entropy production associated with the build up of quantum coherence. The relationship is characterized by an effective temperature of the final adiabatic state and holds for slow to moderate driving protocols. For fast protocols, the frictional work is instead described by the quantum relative entropy between the final non-adiabatic and adiabatic states. We compare our results to those obtained from an integrable spin chain, in which case the adiabatic state is no longer described by a single temperature. In this case, the frictional work is described by a sum of terms for each independent subspace of the spin chain, which are at different effective temperatures. We show how integrability breaking can enhance work extraction in the adiabatic limit, but degrade work extraction in sufficiently non-adiabatic regimes.

Abstract: We present a non-perturbative, first-principles derivation of renormalization relations for waveguide-QED models, explicitly accounting for the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) cutoffs that are necessarily introduced in numerical simulations. By formulating the atomic dynamics in the time domain, we obtain explicit expressions linking the bare model parameters to the physically observable atomic frequency and decay rate, and verify their consistency with scattering theory. We further connect these results to standard Feynman diagrams, providing a transparent physical interpretation and ensuring the generality of the approach. Finally, we show how these renormalization relations can be used to parameterize simulations with a minimal frequency bandwidth, simultaneously preserving physical accuracy and reducing computational cost, thereby paving the way for efficient and reliable multi-photon light-matter simulations.

Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving realizes parameter displacement of an energy eigenstate of a given parametrized Hamiltonian using the adiabatic gauge potential. In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.

Abstract: We study a general bipartite quantum system consisting of a spin interacting with a bosonic field, with the initial state prepared as the product of a spin coherent state and a canonical coherent state. Our goal is to develop a semiclassical framework to describe the entanglement dynamics between these two subsystems. Using appropriate approximations, we derive a semiclassical expression for the entanglement entropy that depends exclusively on the trajectories of the underlying classical description. By analytically extending the classical phase space into the complex domain, we identify additional complex trajectories that significantly improve the accuracy of the semiclassical description. The inclusion of these complex trajectories allows us to capture the entanglement dynamics with remarkable precision, even well beyond the Ehrenfest time. The approach is illustrated with a representative example, where the role of real and complex trajectories in reproducing the quantum entanglement entropy is explicitly demonstrated.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A study on the engineered quantum Mpemba effect through the Liouvillian skin effect in open quantum systems. We demonstrate how to prepare the initial states for the Mpemba effect using this approach, and discover a unique form of QME (QME-III).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling quantum effects is key to advancing quantum technologies. The Quantum Mpemba effect (QME), where a quantum system can sometimes warm up faster than cooling, is a fascinating phenomenon. Engineering QME has applications in quantum computing and thermodynamics. Our study provides a new approach to engineer QME through the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE), which could lead to practical implementations in the future.

Method: We use quadratic Lindbladians, which are mathematical models describing the interaction of quantum systems with their environment. By analyzing the Lindbladian dynamics, we determine the initial states that realize the QME. Specifically, we present two concrete cases in detail, allowing us to identify and verify each type of QME, including the QME-III type.

Result: We successfully engineer a new type of QME (QME-III) through the LSE, which is distinct from the standard QME types. The Hilbert-Schmidt distance analysis reveals two reversal points, confirming the existence of the QME-III effect. This unique behavior enhances our understanding of QME and opens new possibilities for its applications.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of using the Liouvillian skin effect to engineer quantum phenomena like the Mpemba effect. The identification of the QME-III type provides a richer scenario for future studies, and our method offers a systematic approach to realizing QME in practical settings.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to engineer the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) -- wherein an initial state farther from system relaxes faster than a close one -- by the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE) in open quantum systems. Moreover, the LSE serves as an ideal platform for realizing the QME and the spatial profile of the LSE provides a straightforward pathway for the initial state preparation, thereby enabling readily accessible experimental preparation. Focusing on the quadratic Lindbladians, we consider two concrete cases to design the initial states, thereby realizing the QME. Interestingly, we uncover a new kind of QME (QME-III) that is distinct from the two typical scenarios, manifested as two reversals in the Hilbert-Schmidt distance at two different times. In particular, the LSE provides a physically more intuitive understanding of the QME.

Abstract: We implement and benchmark on IBM Quantum hardware the circuit family proposed by Violaris for estimating operational inter-branch communication witnesses, defined as correlations in classical measurement records produced by compiled Wigner's-friend-style circuits. We realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern within a single circuit, rather than physical signaling, and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution of an observer subsystem whose dynamics depend on a control qubit, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between conditional measurement contexts.
  Executing on the ibm_fez backend with 20000 shots, we observe population-based visibility of 0.877, coherence witnesses of 0.840 and -0.811 along orthogonal axes, and a phase-sensitive magnitude of approximately 1.17. While the visibility metric is insensitive to some classes of dephasing, the coherence witnesses provide complementary sensitivity to off-diagonal noise.
  This work does not test or discriminate among interpretations of quantum mechanics. Instead, it provides a reproducible operational constraint pipeline for evaluating detectability of non-ideal channels relative to calibrated device noise.

Abstract: Quantum metrology typically demands the preparation of exotic quantum probe states, such as entangled or squeezed states, to surpass classical limits. However, the need for carefully calibrated system parameters and finely optimized quantum controls imposes limitations on scalability and robustness. Here, we circumvent these limitations by introducing an echoed random process that achieves sensitivity approaching the Heisenberg limit while remaining blind to the random probe state. We demonstrate that by simply driving a Kerr nonlinear mode with random pulses, the emergence of sub-Planck phase-space structures grants high sensitivity, eliminating the need for complex quantum control. The protocol is statistically robust, yielding high performance across broad driving parameter ranges while exhibiting resilience to control fluctuations and photon loss. Broadly applicable to both bosonic and qubit platforms, our work reveals a practical, hardware-efficient, scalable, and optimization-free route to quantum-enhanced metrology in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Abstract: A relevant signal in the quantum domain may manifest as a displacement or a phase shift operator in the bosonic phase space. For a real parameter $β$ embedded in such a displacement operator, the task of determining if $β\in [β_{-th}, β_{+th}]$ for real asymmetric thresholds $(β_{-th} \ne -β_{+th})$ is a binary decision problem. We propose a framework based on generalized quantum signal processing interferometry (GQSPI) on hybrid qubit-bosonic oscillator systems that addresses this parameter detection problem by recasting the practical task of active binary hypothesis testing on quantum systems to that of a polynomial approximation. We achieve a small decision error probability $p_{err}$ on the order of $O(\frac{1}{d}\log{(d)})$, with $d$ as the circuit depth. We analyze the protocol when (i) $β$ is a deterministic parameter, and (ii) when $β$ is drawn randomly from a known prior distribution. The performance of the sensing protocol under dephasing noise is also shown to be robust. We further extend our protocol from two thresholds to more general multi-threshold cases as well. Overall, the proposed framework enables decision-making over arbitrary thresholds for any general displacement signal in a single or a few shots.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effect of coarse graining in quantum measurement on phase estimation precision and finds that even extremely coarse-grained measurements can achieve quantum enhancement beyond the standard quantum limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how experimental imperfections, particularly coarse graining in quantum measurements, affect quantum metrology and to find practical strategies for achieving quantum enhancement despite these imperfections.

Method: The method involves theoretical analysis using Fisher information under various coarse-graining conditions and an experimental setup using an interferometer with a squeezed vacuum and laser input. The optimal estimation strategy is determined by the method of moments, and calibration procedures are provided for general experimental settings.

Result: The results show that with only two bins, a quantum enhancement of 1.2 dB is achieved compared to the classical method using ideal measurements. As the number of bins increases, the improvement approaches 3.8 dB.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that it is possible to achieve quantum enhancement in the presence of severe experimental imperfections, specifically coarse graining, by employing optimal estimation strategies derived from theoretical analysis and experimental calibration.

Abstract: While quantum metrology enables measurement precision beyond classical limits, its performance is often susceptible to experimental imperfections. Most prior studies have focused on imperfections in quantum states and operations. Here, we investigate the effect of coarse graining in quantum measurement through both theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration. Using an interferometer with a squeezed vacuum and a laser input, we analyze how coarse graining in homodyne detection affects the precision of phase estimation. We evaluate the Fisher information under various coarse-graining conditions and determine, in each case, an optimal estimation strategy that saturates the Cramér-Rao bound. Remarkably, even extremely coarse-grained measurement -- with only two bins -- enables phase estimation beyond the standard quantum limit and even achieves a precision that follows the Heisenberg scaling. We experimentally demonstrate quantum-enhanced phase estimation under coarse-grained homodyne detection. To determine an optimal estimation strategy, we employ the method of moments and present calibration procedures that enable its application to general experimental settings. Using only two bins, we observe a quantum enhancement of 1.2 dB compared to the classical method using the ideal measurement, improving towards 3.8 dB as the bin number increases. These results highlight a practical pathway to achieving quantum enhancement under the presence of severe experimental imperfections.

Abstract: Prime factorization on quantum processors is typically implemented either via circuit-based approaches such as Shor's algorithm or through Hamiltonian optimization methods based on adiabatic, annealing, or variational techniques. While Shor's algorithm demands high-fidelity quantum gates, Hamiltonian optimization schemes, with prime factors encoded as degenerate ground states of a problem Hamiltonian, generally require substantial classical post-processing to determine control parameters. We propose an all-quantum, measurement-based feedback approach that iteratively steers a quantum system toward the target ground state, eliminating the need for classical computation of drive parameters once the problem Hamiltonian is determined and realized. As a proof of principle, we experimentally factor the biprime 551 using a three-qubit NMR quantum register and numerically analyze the robustness of the method against control field-errors. We further demonstrate scalability by numerically implementing the FALQON factorization of larger biprimes, 9,167 and 2,106,287, using 5 and 9 qubits, respectively.

Abstract: McDonald and Clerk [Phys.\ Rev.\ Research 5, 033107 (2023)] showed that for linear open quantum systems the Liouvillian spectrum is independent of the noise strength. We first make this noise-independence principle precise in continuous time for multimode bosonic Gaussian Markov semigroups: for Hurwitz drift, a time-independent Gaussian similarity fixed by the Lyapunov equation gauges away diffusion for all times, so eigenvalues and non-diagonalizability are controlled entirely by the drift, while diffusion determines steady states and the structure of eigenoperators. We then extend the same separation to discrete time for general stable multimode bosonic Gaussian channels: for any stable Gaussian channel, we construct an explicit Gaussian similarity transformation that gauges away diffusion at the level of the channel parametrization. We illustrate the method with a single-mode squeezed-reservoir Lindbladian and with a non-Markovian family of single-mode Gaussian channels, where the exceptional-point manifolds and the associated gauging covariances can be obtained analytically.

Abstract: Real-time decoding of quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. A practical decoder must operate with high accuracy at low latency, while remaining robust to spatial and temporal variations in hardware noise. We introduce a hardware-conditioned neural decoder framework designed to exploit the natural separation of timescales in superconducting processors, where calibration drifts occur over hours while error correction requires microsecond-scale responses. By processing calibration data through a graph-based encoder and conditioning a lightweight convolutional backbone via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM), we decouple the heavy processing of device statistics from the low-latency syndrome decoding.
  We evaluate this approach using the 1D repetition code as a testbed on IBM Fez, Kingston, and Pittsburgh processors, collecting over 2.7 million experimental shots spanning distances up to d = 11. We demonstrate that a single trained model generalizes to unseen qubit chains and new calibration data acquired days later without retraining. On these unseen experiments, the FiLM-conditioned decoder achieves up to an 11.1x reduction in logical error rate relative to modified minimum-weight perfect matching. We observe that by employing a network architecture that exploits the highly asynchronous nature of system calibration and decoding, hardware-conditioned neural decoding demonstrates promising, adaptive performance with negligible latency overhead relative to unconditioned baselines.

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are ubiquitous in time-series modelling, with applications ranging from chemical reaction modelling to speech recognition. These HMMs are often large, with high-dimensional memories. A recently-proposed application of quantum technologies is to execute quantum analogues of HMMs. Such quantum HMMs (QHMMs) are strictly more expressive than their classical counterparts, enabling the construction of more parsimonious models of stochastic processes. However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic. In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.

Abstract: In combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states, fair sampling of degenerate solutions is essential. However, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with a standard transverse-field mixer induces biases among degenerate states as circuit depth increases. Based on quantum-classical correspondence theory, we propose SBO-QAOA, which employs a temperature-dependent Hamiltonian encoding a Gibbs distribution as its ground state. Numerical simulations show that, unlike standard QAOA, SBO-QAOA yields ground-state probabilities converging to finite-temperature values with uniform distribution among degenerate states. These fairness and temperature-targeting properties are preserved even with only four variational parameters under a linear schedule.

Abstract: Many physical phenomena, including thermalization in open quantum systems and quantum Gibbs sampling, are modeled by Lindbladians approximating a system weakly coupled to a bath. Understanding the convergence speed of these Lindbladians to their steady states is crucial for bounding algorithmic runtimes and thermalization timescales. We study two such families of processes: one characterizing a repeated-interaction Gibbs sampling algorithm, and another modeling open many-body quantum thermalization. We prove that both converge in polynomial time for several non-commuting systems, including high-temperature local lattices, weakly interacting fermions, and 1D spin chains. These results demonstrate that simple dissipative quantum algorithms can prepare complex Gibbs states and that Lindblad dynamics accurately capture thermal relaxation. Our proofs rely on a novel technical result that extrapolates spectral gap lower bounds from quasi-local Lindbladians to the non-local generators governing these dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding how to analyze highly entangled thermal eigenstates is a central challenge in the study of quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we introduce a stabilizer-based approach to construct analytically tractable energy eigenstates of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians. Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy $k$-body microscopic thermal equilibrium for any $k\ge4$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly constructing two-body nonintegrable Hamiltonians whose stabilizer eigenstates reproduce thermal expectation values for all two-body and all three-body observables. Finally, we identify the structural origin of this limitation by characterizing the conditions under which a stabilizer state can appear as a zero-energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, thereby revealing a fundamental constraint imposed by the few-body nature of interactions.

TL;DR: This paper explores energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators using wavepacket initialization to enhance energy resolution, achieving an energy-dependent Anderson localization transition in an 8x7 lattice model. Error mitigation via maximum-likelihood estimation proves effective, outperforming post-selection by reducing uncertainty. A quantum algorithm is presented for initializing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional interacting fermion model, suitable for near-term quantum computers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding transport properties in quantum systems, particularly the role of energy dependence, is crucial for advancing quantum physics and computing. This paper addresses a significant challenge in quantum simulators by introducing a novel method to improve energy resolution and observe fundamental transport phenomena like Anderson localization.

Method: The authors propose using wavepackets initialized with tunable energy, leveraging quantum simulators to study transport properties. They implement an error mitigation strategy using maximum-likelihood estimation to infer noiseless output distributions, reducing systematic errors and statistical uncertainty. Additionally, they develop a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional interacting fermion model.

Result: The key results include the successful observation of an energy-dependent Anderson localization transition in a finite-size system, demonstrating the presence of a mobility edge. The wavepacket-based approach shows promise for studying many-body transport phenomena. The error mitigation method significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of the results, providing a robust framework for future studies.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for probing transport properties in quantum systems with improved energy resolution. The success of the wavepacket initialization and error mitigation strategies suggests that quantum simulators can be effectively utilized to study complex many-body phenomena, paving the way for future advancements in quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.

Abstract: Bell tests based on homodyne detection are strongly constrained in continuous-variable systems. Can Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding turn homodyne detection into a practical tool for revealing Bell nonlocality? We consider a physically motivated model in which each party performs homodyne detection and digitizes the continuous outcome via a fixed periodic binning, corresponding to logical Pauli measurements. Within this framework, we derive a bipartite no-go: CHSH cannot be violated for Bell-pair states. Moving beyond two parties, we show that finitely squeezed GKP-encoded GHZ and W states nevertheless exhibit strong multipartite nonlocality, violating multipartite Bell inequalities with homodyne-only readout. We quantify the required squeezing thresholds and robustness to loss, providing a route toward homodyne-based Bell tests in continuous-variable systems.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave oscillators underpin key applications in communication, spectroscopy, radar, and astronomy, yet their achievable spectral purity remains limited. Approaches that directly generate millimeter-wave carriers are fundamentally limited by quantum and thermal phase-noise processes. Here we show that these limits can be overcome by combining Kerr-induced optical frequency division in a chip-scale microresonator with a large-spacing dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. This 3.3 THz optical reference injection-locks a Kerr soliton microcomb, with a repetition rate that becomes a coherently divided 300 GHz carrier with phase noise below the quantum limit of a corresponding 300 GHz dual-wavelength Brillouin laser and far below the thermo-refractive noise of a microring resonator. Cross-correlation phase-noise measurements were developed to show that the resulting oscillator reaches a phase-noise floor of -152 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, consistent with photodetection shot noise. Integration of the measured spectrum yields an RMS timing jitter of 135 as from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. These results establish optical frequency division as a generic method for generation of sub-terahertz carriers with coherence no longer constrained by direct-generation limits.

Abstract: Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonators operating at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies are widely used in wireless telecommunication and quantum information processing. Successful implementation of such resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of their mode profiles, energy dissipation channels, and imperfections from microfabrication. In this work, we report on the visualization of acoustic waves in LiNbO3 SAW resonators by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM). The Gaussian mode profile tightly confined by reflecting mirrors is vividly seen in the TMIM images, from which the linewidth of the resonator itself can be extracted. The spatially resolved acoustic profile also allows us to perform failure analysis on faulty devices. Our work establishes a pathway for further optimization of SAW resonators for classical and quantum acoustic applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of red blood cells (RBCs) under the influence of evanescent waves generated by total internal reflection (TIR). Using a 1064 nm laser system and a dual-chamber prism setup, we quantified the mobility of erythrocytes in different glucose environments. Our methodology integrates automated tracking via TrackMate\c{opyright} to analyze over 60 trajectory sets. The results reveal a significant decrease in mean velocity, from 11.8 μm/s in 5 mM glucose to 8.8 μm/s in 50 mM glucose (p = 0.019). These findings suggest that evanescent waves can serve as a non-invasive tool to probe the mechanical properties of cell membranes influenced by biochemical changes.

Abstract: The integration of light and materials technology is key to the creation of innovative sensing technologies. Sensing of electric and magnetic fields, and temperature with high spatio-temporal resolution is a critical task for the development of the next-generation of nanometer-scale quantum devices. Color centers in diamonds are attractive for potential applications owing to their characteristic quantum states, although they require metallic contacts for the introduction of external microwaves. Here, we build an ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor to assess the surface electric field; an electro-optic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond nanotip breaks the spatial-limit of conventional pump-probe techniques. The 10-fs near-infrared optical pulse modulates the surface electric field of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide and we monitor the dynamics of the local electric field at nanometer-femtosecond spatio-temporal resolutions. Our nanoscopic technique will provide new horizons to the sensing of advanced nano materials.

Abstract: Transitions from bound states in the continuum (BICs) to quasi-BICs (qBICs) are typically realized by introducing in-plane asymmetry, including permittivity asymmetry (ε-qBICs) and geometry asymmetry (g-qBICs). Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called σh -qBICs in this work. When the {σh symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime. Our findings establish a general mechanism for engineering high-Q resonances and topologically robust plasmonic cavities.

Conclusion: This work makes a significant advancement in real-time hologram generation for HMDs, paving the way for practical six-degree-of-freedom displays.

Abstract: A head-mounted display (HMD) using holography technology (holo-HMD) is expected to be the next generation of HMDs capable of reducing three-dimensional sickness. In HMDs, it is important to generate images that respond to head movement in real time. However, in holo-HMDs, generation of hologram data in real time is difficult due to the large computational resources required. This paper proposes a fast calculation algorithm for generating hologram data for holo-HMDs, which requires low computational power. A holo-HMD supporting six degrees of freedom was also developed using this algorithm and it was confirmed that it obtained reconstructed images with six degrees of freedom in real time (30 fps or more).

Motivation: Precise identification and concentration detection of CO are important in atmospheric monitoring, industrial production, and medical diagnosis.

Method: The paper proposes a method utilizing up-conversion detection to convert mid-infrared absorption signals from TDLAS to visible light, followed by detection using a silicon-based detector. Additionally, single-photon level real-time detection is achieved using SPAD after diffuse reflection.

Result: The method achieves a sensitivity of 79.6 ppb under cavity-free in-situ conditions with an absorption range length of 0.14 m.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of the proposed detection method for practical applications such as industrial process monitoring and medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) is a significant indicator gas with considerable application value in atmospheric monitoring, industrial production and medical diagnosis. Its fundamental vibrational band locates around 4.6 $\upmu$m and has larger absorption line strength than that of overtone band, which is more suitable for the precise identification and concentration detection of CO. In this paper, the up-conversion detection is employed to convert the mid-infrared absorption signal obtained by TDLAS to the visible light band, then a silicon-based detector is utilized for detection. By which, we can achieve the highest sensitivity of 79.6 ppb under the condition of cavity-free in-situ with an absorption range length of only 0.14 m. Furthermore, the single-photon level real-time detection of CO concentration after the diffuse reflection is realized by using SPAD. This work demonstrates the merits of the up-conversion detection in terms of its functionality at room temperature and capacity for sensitivity detection. Furthermore, it presents a design and optimization methodology that has the potential to underpin the advancement of the method towards more practical applications, like industrial process monitoring, medical diagnosis and so on.

Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) has demonstrated diverse imaging capabilities enabled by its encoding-decoding-based computational imaging mechanism. Accordingly, information-theoretic studies have emerged as a promising avenue for probing the fundamental performance bounds of of GI and related computational imaging paradigms. However, the design of information-theoretically optimal encoding strategies remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the intractability of the prior probability density function (PDF) of an unknown scene. Here, by leveraging the ability of recursively estimating the PDF of the object to be imaged via Bayesian filtering, we propose to establish an adaptive information-maximization encoding (AIME) design framework. Based on the adaptively estimated posterior PDF from previously acquired measurements, the expected information gain of subsequent detections is evaluated and maximized to design the corresponding encoding patterns in a closed-loop manner. Within this framework, the theoretical form of the information-optimal encoding under representative physical constraints is analytically derived. Corresponding experimental results show that, GI systems employing information-optimal encoding achieve markedly improved imaging performance compared with conventional fixed point-to-point imaging without relying on additional heuristic regularization schemes, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Moreover, the proposed strategy consistently enables significantly enhanced information acquisition capability compared with existing encoding strategies, leading to substantially improved imaging quality. These results establish a principled information-theoretic foundation for optimal encoding design in computational imaging paradigms,provided that the forward model can be accurately characterized.

Abstract: Ultrafast laser welding provides a promising approach for high precision integration of transparent and metallic materials. However, its practical application remains constrained by the precise regulation of the interfacial gap. This study investigates the interfacial response and bonding mechanism of sapphire and Fe-36Ni alloy joints under controlled non-optical contact conditions using burst mode ultrafast laser irradiation. A polymer interlayer was introduced between naturally stacked samples to establish a variable interfacial gap, allowing systematic evaluation of gap-dependent morphology, melting behavior, and elemental transport. By redistributing the pulse energy into sequential sub-pulses, the burst mode reconstructs the temporal energy-deposition process, yielding enhanced plasma-material coupling and stable thermal accumulation. Compared with single pulse irradiation, burst mode sustains continuous bonding across gaps exceeding 10 um--far beyond the failure threshold of the single pulse mode--and forms a fusion zone 82% larger. Fracture surface and cross-sectional analyses of SEM and EDS results confirm that sequential sub-pulses promote extensive sapphire melting, droplet-driven gap bridging, and enhanced Al-Fe interdiffusion at the interface. These results provide a scientific basis for high-gap-tolerance ultrafast laser welding and scalable integration of transparent-metal hybrid components in advanced optoelectronic and precision engineering applications.

TL;DR: An optical transistor capable of simultaneous amplification and switching is theoretically proposed using cascaded second-order nonlinear interactions in a resonant structure. Two operational schemes are analyzed: a single frequency scheme using cascaded second harmonic generation and inverse second harmonic generation, and a dual frequency scheme using cascaded second harmonic generation and optical parametric amplification. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations demonstrate cascadable amplification and digital on/off switching. The proposed structure shows promising performance for integrated photonic circuits with applications in all-optical communication and computing.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking design for an optical transistor that can perform both amplification and switching simultaneously. The scalability and efficiency of the proposed structure open new possibilities for the development of advanced integrated photonic circuits with potential applications in all-optical communication and computing technologies.

Abstract: An optical transistor capable of simultaneous amplification and switching is theoretically proposed via cascaded second-order nonlinear interactions in a resonant structure. Two distinct operational schemes are analyzed. A single frequency scheme employs cascaded second harmonic generation and inverse second harmonic generation (SHG/iSHG) using two Type-I SHG interactions, whereas a dual frequency scheme employs cascaded SHG and optical parametric amplification (SHG/OPA). Exact theoretical solutions and numerical calculations show cascadable amplification and digital on/off switching. A new optical phenomenon of nonlinear transparency is predicted by the theoretical solutions and confirmed by the numerical solutions in each scheme of the cascaded SHG/iSHG and SHG/OPA. The single and dual frequency configurations satisfy the cascadability and fan-out criteria with power transfer ratios of 4.838 and 52.26 and power amplification factors of 48.38 and 522.6, respectively. These results indicate transistor-like performance at input powers in the milliwatt range, readily supplied by laser diodes. The proposed structure establishes a physically feasible and practically scalable route to optical transistors operating at high speed and low power for integrated photonic circuits, with broad applications in all optical communication and computing.

Abstract: Modulation and control of lasers and optical signals is necessary for trapped-ion and cold neutral atom quantum systems. Given the diversity of atomic species, experimental modalities, and architectures, integrated optical modulators designed to operate across the visible to near-infrared spectrum are a key step towards portable, robust, and compact quantum computers, clocks, and sensors. Integrated optical modulators that are wavelength-independent, CMOS-compatible, and capable of maintaining low waveguide losses and a high resonator quality factor, DC-coupled broadband frequency response, and low power consumption, are essential for scalable photonic integration. Yet progress towards these goals has remained limited. Here we demonstrate four types of integrated stress-optic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) silicon nitride modulators: a coil Mach-Zehnder modulator, a coil pure phase modulator, and bus-coupled and add-drop ring resonator modulators, with operation from 493 nm to 780 nm. The coil MZM operates at 532 nm with a V$π$ of 2.8V, a 0.4 MHz 3-dB bandwidth, and an extinction ratio of 21.5dB. The coil phase modulator operates at 493 nm with a V$π$ of 2.8V and low residual amplitude modulation of -34 dB at a 1kHz offset. The bus-coupled ring resonator modulator operates at 493 nm and the add-drop ring resonator modulator operates at 780 nm. The ring-based modulators have an intrinsic quality factor of 3.4 million and 1.9 million, a linear tuning strength of 0.9 GHz/V and 1 GHz/V, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 2.6 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively. All four modulator designs maintain the low optical waveguide loss of SiN, are DC coupled with broadband frequency response, operate independent of wavelength, and consume only tens of nW per actuator. Such solutions unlock the potential for further integration with other precision SiN components to realize chip-scale atomic and quantum systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5), as a silicon-photonic-compatible material platform, has garnered significant attention for high-performance integrated photonics due to its exceptional properties: a broad transparency window spanning from 0.28 um to 8 um, a moderate refractive index of 2.05 at 1550 nm, and an impressive nonlinear refractive index of 7.2X10^(-19) m^2/W. Despite these advantages, achieving low-loss fabrication of monolithic microrings on the Ta2O5 platform remains challenging due to its inherent hardness and brittleness, which often result in rough sidewalls and significant scattering losses. In this work, we successfully demonstrated monolithic Ta2O5 microring resonators with exceptionally high intrinsic and loaded quality (Q) factors. This was accomplished through the innovative application of photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technology. By optimizing the coupling region between the microring and the bus waveguide, as well as meticulously controlling surface roughness during fabrication, we achieved near-critical coupling in the resulting microrings. The devices exhibited loaded Q factors of 2.74X10(6) in the telecom band without employing expensive electron-beam lithography, showing an intrinsic Q factor as high as 4.47X10(6) and a low propagation loss of only 0.0732 dB/cm - representing the highest results reported for strongly confined Ta2O5-based microring resonators to date. This work paves the way for the development of advanced photonic devices on the Ta2O5 platform with low manufacturing cost, including low-threshold microlasers, highly sensitive sensors, broad bandwidth supercontinuum sources, and optical frequency combs.

Abstract: Reliable identification of microplastic fibers is crucial for environmental monitoring but remains analytically challenging. We report an explainable deep-learning framework for classifying microplastic and natural microfibers using polarization-resolved digital holographic microscopy. From multiplexed holograms, the complex Jones matrix of each fiber was reconstructed to extract polarization eigen-parameters describing optical anisotropy. Statistical descriptors of nine polarization characteristics formed a 72-dimensional feature vector for a total of 296 fibers spanning six material classes, including polyamide 6, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide 6.6, polypropylene, cotton and wool. The designed fully connected deep neural network achieved an accuracy of 96.7 % on the validation data, surpassing that of common machine-learning classifiers. Explainable artificial intelligence analysis with Shapley additive explanations identified eigenvalue-ratio quantities as dominant predictors, revealing the physical basis for classification. An additional reduced-feature model with the preserved architecture exploiting only these most significant eigenvalue-based characteristics retained high accuracy (93.3 %), thereby confirming their dominant role while still outperforming common machine-learning classifiers.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient wave-optics simulation of partially coherent light transport systems is critical for the design of advanced optical systems, ranging from computational lithography to diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSR). However, traditional approaches based on Coherent Mode Decomposition suffer from high computational costs due to the propagating massive sets of two-dimensional modes. In this paper, we propose the Coherent Mode Decoupling (CMDC) algorithm, a high-throughput computational framework designed to accelerate these simulations by orders of magnitude without compromising physical fidelity. The method factorizes 2D modes into efficient one-dimensional (1D) components, while crucially incorporating a subspace compression strategy to capture non-separable coupling effects. We demonstrated the generality and robustness of this framework in applications ranging from computational lithography to coherent beamlines of DLSR.

TL;DR: The paper discusses managing photorefractive effects in lithium niobate waveguides used in nonlinear optical devices. High-temperature solutions are not always feasible, so they propose using an auxiliary light source to restore phase-matching and reduce pyroelectric effects, making it suitable for cryogenic and space applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear optical devices, such as those used in quantum optics, rely on precise control of light interactions. Managing photorefractive effects is crucial for maintaining performance, especially in environments with strict power budgets or extreme temperatures.

Method: The study involved two experiments: one at high temperatures and another at cryogenic conditions. An auxiliary light source was used in the second experiment to address phase-matching issues caused by photorefraction.

Result: The proposed method successfully restored phase-matching spectra at cryogenic temperatures and optimized energy use, offering a practical solution for space and cryogenic applications.

Conclusion: This method provides a photorefractive management alternative suitable for cryogenic environments and energy-sensitive applications like space technology.

Abstract: Lithium niobate sees widespread use in nonlinear and quantum optical devices, such as for sum- and difference-frequency generation or spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In lithium niobate waveguides, nonlinear optical processes are often limited by the so-called photorefractive effect, which limits the maximum input or output powers and impacts the nonlinear spectral response. Therefore, strategies for the management of photorefractive damage are a key consideration in device design. Usually, the photorefractive damage threshold, i.e. the maximal permissible operating power, can be increased by high temperature operation of devices. This approach, however, is not applicable in cryogenic environments, which may be required for specialized applications. To better understand the impact of photorefraction in nonlinear optical applications, we study the impact of photorefraction on the phase-matching spectra of two nonlinear-optical sum-frequency generation experiments at 1) high temperatures and 2) cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we present an approach to reduce the impact of photorefraction which is compatible with cryogenic operation. This comprises an auxiliary light source, propagating in the same waveguide, which is used to restore phase-matching spectra impacted by photorefraction, as well as reduce pyroelectric effects. Our work provides an alternative route to photorefraction management applicable to cryogenic environments, as well as in situations with tight energy budgets like space applications.

Abstract: Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy is central to wide range of biology, engineering, and histopathology; but is inherently limited to two-dimensional qualitative imaging, systematically investigating three-dimensional (3D) volumetric architecture. Here we introduce quantitative absorption tomography (QAT), a computational approach that quantitatively reconstructs high-resolution volumetric absorption coefficient distributions from brightfield focal stacks. By modeling absorption image formation in logarithmic intensity space and applying deconvolution with an absorption optical transfer function, QAT enables quantitative, spectrally resolved 3D absorption imaging without interferometry, sample rotation, or specialized hardware. We validate QAT using spectrally selective phantoms and demonstrate absorption-specific contrast complementary to refractive index tomography in living melanocytes and intact plant tissue. QAT further scales to millimeter-scale volumes of H&E-stained human tissue, revealing 3D histological microarchitecture without serial sectioning. This approach extends brightfield microscopy toward practical 3D histopathology.

Abstract: Opto-electronic computing combines the complementary strengths of photonics and electronics to deliver ultrahigh computational throughput with high energy efficiency. However, its practical deployment for real-world applications has been limited by architectures that rely on delicate wavelength management or phase-sensitive coherent detection. Here, we demonstrate the first multimode opto-electronic neural network (MOENN) on a silicon-on-insulator platform. By utilizing orthogonal waveguide eigenmodes as independent information carriers, our architecture achieves robust single-wavelength computation that is inherently immune to spectral crosstalk and phase noise. The fabricated MOENN chip monolithically integrates all functional components, including input encoders, programmable mode-division fan-in/-out units, and most importantly, the nonlinear multimode activation functions. We report the system's versatility through in-situ training via a genetic algorithm, successfully resolving the nonlinear decision boundaries of a two-class dataset and achieving 92.1% accuracy on the Iris classification benchmark. Furthermore, we reconfigure the MOENN into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, attaining an accuracy of 90.7% on the electrocardiogram-based emotion recognition task. This work establishes a new opto-electronic computing paradigm of simple control and excellent robustness, providing a compelling path toward scalable, deployable photonic intelligence.

Abstract: Biological membranes are dynamic surfaces whose shape and function are critically influenced by protein inclusions (PIs). While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.

Abstract: The conformal integration of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center nanodiamond arrays onto soft, hydrated, curvilinear biological interfaces remain a fundamental challenge for in vivo quantum sensing and imaging. Conventional transfer techniques often fail due to reliance on high temperature, corrosive chemicals, or mechanical peeling, leading to pattern damage, low fidelity, or poor biocompatibility. Here, we report a transfer strategy utilizing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) carrier soluble tape, enabling rapid, residue-free, high-fidelity transfer of nanodiamond patterns onto diverse biointerfaces. The success of this method is rooted in a unique "hydrate-soften-expand-self-peel" mechanism of the soluble tape with PVA backing. In situ mechanical tracking reveals non-uniform PVA swelling upon hydration generates transient local normal and shear stresses at the interface. These stresses delaminate the tape within 3 minutes at room temperature while promoting adhesion of the nanodiamond array to the substrate. In contrast, conventional water-soluble tapes with composite structures undergo passive dissolution and collapse, causing residue contamination and reduced efficiency. Leveraging this mechanism, we achieve conformal patterning on ultra-soft hydrogels (~0.6 kPa) and highly curved bio-surfaces (hair, 100 μm^-1). Additionally, we demonstrate a dual-identity verification system integrating data storage and physical unclonable functions on a hydrogel contact lens. This work provides a versatile tool for bio-interface engineering and a general framework for gentle, efficient transfer of functional nanomaterials.

Abstract: This paper presents a numerical study of the dynamics of DNA double helix breakage under the influence of external forces using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model. The PBD model represents DNA as a chain of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, which makes it possible to analyze the processes of melting and mechanical denaturation. The main focus is on cases where an external force is applied to the terminal or central site of a DNA molecule, simulating stretching at a constant rate. The critical force required to break hydrogen bonds, which depends on the point of application of the force, is calculated. It is found that the denaturation process occurs stepwise, with characteristic peaks in the force-time graphs. The phenomenon of hysteresis under periodic exposure to external forces is also studied, which is important for understanding energy losses and heating of the system.

Abstract: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific genomic loci determined by DNA sequence. Their sequence specificity is commonly summarized by a consensus binding motif. However, eukaryotic genomes contain billions of low-affinity DNA sequences to which TFs associate with a sequence-dependent binding energy. We currently lack insight into how the genomic sequence defines this spectrum of binding energies and the resulting pattern of TF localization. Here, we set out to obtain a quantitative understanding of sequence-dependent TF binding to both motif and non-motif sequences. We achieve this by first pursuing accurate measurements of physical binding energies of the human TF Klf4 to a library of short DNA sequences in a fluorescence-anisotropy-based bulk competitive binding assay. Second, we show that the highly non-linear sequence dependence of Klf4 binding energies can be captured by combining a linear model of binding energies with an Ising model of the coupled recognition of nucleotides by a TF. We find that this statistical mechanics model parametrized by our in vitro measurements captures Klf4 binding patterns on individual long DNA molecules stretched in the optical tweezer, and is predictive for Klf4 occupancy across the entire human genome without additional fit parameters.

Abstract: For a few decades, Fluorescent Molecular Rotors have been commonly employed as local probes of microviscosity in complex materials. However, without proper calibration, relating microviscosity to a physical parameter is unclear, which strongly limits their quantitative use in biological media for instance. In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition. Analysis show that while this theory semi-quantitatively captures the observation, its precise use raises some questions.

Abstract: In this work, we present Enhanced Representation-Based Sampling (ERBS), a novel enhanced sampling method designed to generate structurally diverse training datasets for machine-learned interatomic potentials. ERBS automatically identifies collective variables by dimensionality reduction of atomic descriptors and applies a bias potential inspired by the On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling framework. We highlight the ability of Gaussian moment descriptors to capture collective molecular motions and explore the impact of biasing parameters using alanine dipeptide as a benchmark system. We show that free energy surfaces can be reconstructed with high fidelity using only short biased trajectories as training data. Further, we apply the method to the iterative construction of a liquid water dataset and compare the quality of simulated self-diffusion coefficients for models trained with molecular dynamics and ERBS data. Further, we active-learn models for liquid water with and without enhanced sampling and compare the quality of simulated self-diffusion coefficients. The self-diffusion coefficients closely match those simulated with a reference model at a significantly reduced dataset size. Finally, we compare the sampling behaviour of enhanced sampling methods by benchmarking the mean squared displacements of \ce{BMIM+BF4-} trajectories simulated with uncertainty-driven dynamics and ERBS and find that the latter significantly increases the exploration of configurational space.

Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are increasingly used to replace computationally demanding electronic-structure calculations to model matter at the atomic scale. The most commonly used model architectures are constrained to fulfill a number of physical laws exactly, from geometric symmetries to energy conservation. Evidence is mounting that relaxing some of these constraints can be beneficial to the efficiency and (somewhat surprisingly) accuracy of MLIPs, even though care should be taken to avoid qualitative failures associated with the breaking of physical symmetries. Given the recent trend of \emph{scaling up} models to larger numbers of parameters and training samples, a very important question is how unconstrained MLIPs behave in this limit. Here we investigate this issue, showing that -- when trained on large datasets -- unconstrained models can be superior in accuracy and speed when compared to physically constrained models. We assess these models both in terms of benchmark accuracy and in terms of usability in practical scenarios, focusing on static simulation workflows such as geometry optimization and lattice dynamics. We conclude that accurate unconstrained models can be applied with confidence, especially since simple inference-time modifications can be used to recover observables that are consistent with the relevant physical symmetries.

TL;DR: The paper compares the Shin-Metiu model for electronic crossings using two frameworks: standard Born-Huang (BH) and novel phase space (PS) electronic Hamiltonian. It finds that PS framework achieves smaller relative errors in vibrational energy gaps, especially when not in the strongly nonadiabatic region. Results align with recent findings about dynamics on phase space surfaces outperforming those on Born-Oppenheimer surfaces for curve crossings and multi-surface dynamics, suggesting possible implications for spin-dependent electron transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper appears to be a continuation or comparison study of the Shin-Metiu model, likely within the context of electronic crossing phenomena. The motivation seems to be exploring the applicability and accuracy of different theoretical frameworks in modeling such processes.

Method: The authors utilized both the standard Born-Huang framework and a novel phase space electronic Hamiltonian framework. They employed theoretical analysis, possibly including numerical simulations or calculations, to compare the two methods.

Result: The study reveals that the phase space framework significantly outperforms the Born-Huang framework in terms of relative error in vibrational energy gaps, particularly outside the strongly nonadiabatic region. This suggests that phase space frameworks may offer more accurate descriptions of certain electronic processes.

Conclusion: The findings imply that phase space frameworks, such as the proposed electronic Hamiltonian method, could be valuable tools for studying electronic crossings and related phenomena, potentially offering improvements over traditional Born-Oppenheimer-based approaches.

Abstract: We investigate the well-known Shin-Metiu model for an electronic crossing, using both a standard Born-Huang (BH) framework and a novel phase space (PS) electronic Hamiltonian framework. We show that as long as we are not in the strongly nonadiabatic region, a phase space framework can obtain a relative error in vibrational energy gap which is consistently one order of magnitude smaller than what is found within a BH framework. In line with recent results showing that dynamics on one phase space surface can outperform dynamics on one Born-Oppenheimer surface, our results indicate that the same advantages should largely hold for curve crossings and dynamics on two or a handful of electronic surfaces, from which several implications can be surmised as far as the possibility of spin-dependent electron transfer dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $α$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $α=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($α<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($α>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $ξ\propto1/|α-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.

Abstract: Even-denominator quantum Hall states are leading candidates for realizing non-Abelian topological orders, with the $ν=\frac{5}{2}$ plateau in GaAs the first and most-studied example. Recent experiments in GaAs and bilayer graphene (BLG) have observed many `next-generation' even-denominator states at filling factors such as $ν=\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{3}{8}$, and $\frac{3}{10}$. We develop the theory of these states, including analyses of their bulk quasiparticles, of methods for distinguishing between pairing channels in edge transport measurements, and of their trial wavefunctions. As part of this study, we derive general relations of how flux attachment affects many universal properties of states. In particular, we prove that the topological stability of interface modes is invariant under flux attachment. We compare next-generation paired states to Bonderson-Slingerland states at the same filling factors, and demonstrate that their quasiparticles carry identical charges and obey the same exchange statistics. The next-generation and Bonderson-Slingerland states still describe distinct phases, and we find that the former are energetically favored in the lowest Landau level, while the latter are favored in the first excited level.

Abstract: Vapor deposited two-dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ displays unusual temperature dependent Hall effect properties, including a room temperature anomalous Hall effect, sign reversals of the Hall resistivity on cooling, and a peak in the Hall resistivity at low temperatures. The two dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ heterostructures that form the basis of these measurements are hexagonal in structure. We study the magnetic and structural properties of bulk Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ synthesized by quenching from 1000 $^{\circ}$C with the goal of relating the magnetic, structural, and electronic properties. This quenched phase is metastable, hexagonal, and displays different magnetic properties from the slow-cooled and more thermodynamically stable monoclinic phase. High-resolution x-ray diffraction of the quenched hexagonal phase finds a first-order transition to a lower symmetry monoclinic phase on \textit{heating} above $\sim$ 550 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of the quenched hexagonal phase reveal ferromagnetic ordering above room temperature, along with the two distinct transitions at $\sim$ 220~K and $\sim$ 70~K. Through neutron diffraction studies, we find the $\sim$ 220 K anomaly is a spin reorientation transition of the ferromagnetically aligned magnetic moments and the $\sim70$ K feature represents a transition from a high temperature ferromagnet to a low temperature antiferromagnet. We suggest that these magnetic transitions are related to changes in the unit cell dimensions and are connected to the temperature dependent Hall resisitivity studied in two-dimensional heterostructures. This implies a link between structural, magnetic, and electronic properties in the ``pseudo" two-dimensional chromium tellurides.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that magnetoelastic coupling in EuAl₁₂O₁₉ is primarily due to exchange striction, with shear modulus significantly altering due to magnetic field-induced phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to investigate the relationship between magnetic fields and elastic properties in anisotropic ferromagnets, specifically focusing on the phenomenon of magnetoelastic coupling.

Method: The researchers experimentally measured sound velocity in EuAl₁₂O₁₉ under various magnetic fields, specifically looking at the shear modulus C₄₄ in perpendicular magnetic fields. They analyze the softening of C₄₄ as the material transitions from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state.

Result: The study observes dramatic softening of the shear modulus C₄₄ upon the field-induced phase transition. This softening is explained through theoretical calculations based on magnetization data, suggesting a strain-exchange mechanism.

Conclusion: The findings confirm that magnetoelastic coupling in EuAl₁₂O₁₉ is predominantly caused by exchange striction, offering a model for understanding similar phenomena in other anisotropic ferromagnets.

Abstract: Magnetoelastic coupling plays a crucial role in magnetic-field-induced transitions in anisotropic ferromagnets. Ultrasonic methods are suitable for experimental investigations of these phenomena. We investigate elastic constants in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$, a quasi-two-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnet, by measuring sound velocity in magnetic fields perpendicular to spontaneous magnetization. The shear modulus $C_{44}$ exhibits dramatic softening at the field-induced transition from the ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase with magnetic moments forced to polarize along the applied transverse field. The softening is attributed to strong magnetic fluctuations near a second-order phase transition. Theoretical calculations based on magnetization data qualitatively reproduced the observed behavior within a strain-exchange mechanism. These results demonstrate that magnetoelastic coupling in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$ arises primarily from exchange striction and provide a framework for modeling similar transitions in other anisotropic ferromagnets.

Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements exploiting the natural superstructure modulation of the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) have revealed a possible correlation between the Cu-apical-O distance $δ_{\mathrm{api}}$ and the superconducting order parameter $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$, as reported recently by O'Mahony et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2207449119 (2022)). These observations were interpreted as evidence for a direct link between superconductivity and the charge-transfer gap, and more broadly revived the long-standing question of the role of apical oxygens in cuprate superconductivity. Using a combination of density-functional theory and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we compute from first principles the variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ induced solely by apical oxygen displacement in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+δ}$, Bi-2212, and HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+δ}$. The quantitative agreement between our calculations and experiments allows us to unambiguously attribute the observed variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ to changes in $δ_{\mathrm{api}}$. We demonstrate, however, that these variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ originate predominantly from changes in the effective hole-doping of the CuO$_2$ planes, with negligible effect on the charge-transfer gap. The modest magnitude of the $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ modulation induced by apical-oxygen displacement alone therefore warrants caution in interpreting correlations between $T_c$ and $δ_{\mathrm{api}}$ inferred from comparisons across different cuprate compounds.

Abstract: To achieve room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.

Motivation: 在凝聚态物理中，研究强相互作用的费米系统一直是极具挑战性的问题。由于这些系统的复杂性，即使应用了最先进的数值方法，也难以在参数的许多区域进行求解，特别是在不同尺度的竞争或合作的自由度之间。为此，寻找一种有效的理论方法来近似处理这类问题是非常必要的。

Abstract: Strongly-correlated fermion systems on a lattice have been a subject of intense focus in the field of condensed-matter physics. These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers within a Rydberg atom chain in the regime where laser detuning compensates for nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength. While this simultaneously amplifies the effects of long-range interactions, the conservation of the dimer number remains. Our study opens up possibilities for exploring the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers using the Rydberg atom quantum simulator.

### [109] [Numerical investigation of the generalized Jang equation coupled to conformal flow of metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15359)
*Hollis Williams*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This study explores coupling the generalized Jang equation with the conformal flow of metrics and finds that a previously observed breakdown mechanism in the Jang slope does not occur in this system. The Jang slope remains regular, asymptotically approaching its limit, suggesting that this system could still be viable for proving the Penrose conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Penrose conjecture is a major unsolved problem in general relativity, and understanding the conditions under which it holds is crucial. This study investigates alternative mathematical frameworks that might provide a pathway to proving the conjecture.

Method: The research involves the coupling of the generalized Jang equation with the conformal flow of metrics. The authors restrict to spherical symmetry and time-symmetric initial data, formulate a numerically tractable system, and use computational methods to simulate and analyze the behavior of the Jang slope.

Result: Numerical results indicate that the Jang slope remains regular and asymptotically approaches its limiting value without evidence of a finite radius breakdown. This suggests that the coupling with conformal flow does not introduce the obstruction previously identified by Jaracz in the Jang/zero divergence system.

Conclusion: The findings imply that the Jang/conformal flow system does not exhibit the finite radius breakdown observed in the Jang/zero divergence system. This supports the viability of the Jang/conformal flow system for advancing toward a proof of the Penrose conjecture by providing a viable alternative framework.

Abstract: A recent result of Jaracz has established nonexistence of global solutions to the coupled generalized Jang equation and zero divergence system which satisfy the asymptotic conditions needed to prove the Penrose conjecture by identifying a breakdown mechanism for the Jang slope at finite radius. In this work, we investigate whether a similar obstruction arises when the generalized Jang equation is instead coupled to the conformal flow of metrics. Restricting to spherical symmetry and time-symmetric initial data, we formulate a numerically tractable version of the Jang/conformal flow system. Our numerical results show no evidence of a finite radius breakdown analogous to that observed by Jaracz. Instead, the Jang slope remains regular and approaches its limiting value asymptotically. This behavior persists under controlled perturbations of the warping factor, indicating robustness of the observed phenomenon. These findings suggest that coupling to conformal flow of metrics alters the obstruction mechanism present in the Jang/zero divergence system, and hence that this system may still be viable for proving the Penrose conjecture.

Abstract: Inspired by regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by dark matter halos, we generalize the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor by relaxing the $P_r = -ρ$ condition between radial pressure and density. We demonstrate that while RBHs are a unique special case, a broader class of relations yields horizonless compact stars. Under specific parameter limits, these objects approach a ``frozen state," mimicking black hole features without an event horizon. These compact star solutions could satisfy weak energy conditions and provide a robust mechanism for dark matter-sourced black hole mimickers.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that a topological transition in black hole shadows can occur when the Kerr metric is modified. This transition is characterized by the flipping of topological charge, the derivation of a universal critical exponent, and the identification of a gravitational equal-area law providing critical point criteria. These findings offer a new method for testing fundamental physics of black hole shadows, signaling deviations from general relativity as critical phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of black hole shadows is significant because their properties can reveal deviations from general relativity, providing insights into alternative theories of gravity.

Method: The research employs analytical methods, numerical simulations, and mathematical modeling to explore the topological changes in black hole shadows, identify critical points, and derive critical exponents.

Result: The main findings are: 1) A topological transition in black hole shadows occurs when the Kerr metric is modified, 2) The transition involves flipping of topological charge, 3) A universal critical exponent of 1/2 is identified, placing the system in the mean-field universality class, and 4) A gravitational equal-area law is established, analogous to Maxwell's construction in thermodynamics, for analyzing such transitions.

Conclusion: This study establishes a new framework for testing deviations from general relativity through the observation of topological and critical phenomena in black hole shadows, potentially guiding future searches for alternative theories of gravity.

Abstract: The formation of a cusp on a black hole shadow is a striking signature of physics beyond the Kerr paradigm. We demonstrate that this morphological change fundamentally alters the shadow's topology with the topological charge flipping from 1 to -1. To analyze this topological transition, we introduce a gravitational equal-area law, analogous to Maxwell's construction in thermodynamics, and identify a critical point for cusp formation. Near this point, we uncover universal behavior characterized by a critical exponent 1/2, which places this gravitational lensing system within the mean-field universality class. These results establish a new framework for testing fundamental physics of black hole shadows, reframing the search for deviations from general relativity as a targeted hunt for a distinct topological and critical phenomenon.

Abstract: The Galactic Center black hole environment gives us new opportunity to test deviation from General Relativity and black hole physics. In this work we analytically generate the shape of the Galactic Center black hole by using a recently developed exact stationary, axisymmetric and vacuum solution of $f(R)$ gravity theory. By using scalaron mass as a free parameter we find that the shadow shape along with displacement and asymmetry is sensitive to the scalaron mass, even after keeping the black hole spin low. We recognize scalaron mass which is compatible with Kerr like quadrupole moment and hence black hole "no-hair" theorem. The same mass scale is found to reproduce the PPN parameter ($γ$) constrained in the weak field limit of the solar system. Gravitational identifiers, the Kretschmann scalar ($κ$) and gravitational potential ($φ$) have been used to infer scalaron masses in the regime of S-stars which are found to be consistent with the limits obtained using shadow scales. We ensure that $f(R)$ gravity scalaron has an appropriate general relativistic limit in the horizon scale of the black hole. We also identify the possibility of scale invariance of the General Relativistic limit.

Abstract: We develop the covariant phase space formulation of Weyl-transverse gravity (WTG) in the presence of general timelike and spacelike boundaries. WTG is classically equivalent to General Relativity (GR) but possesses a reduced gauge symmetry consisting of Weyl transformations and transverse diffeomorphisms, together with a fixed background volume form. This structure modifies the variational principle and the definition of conserved quantities relative to GR. We derive the symplectic potential, presymplectic current, and Hamiltonian generators associated with transverse diffeomorphisms, and we identify a set of boundary conditions under which the WTG action is differentiable. These include Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for both the auxiliary Weyl-invariant metric and the dynamical metric, as well as a natural implementation of York boundary conditions, for which WTG exhibits a particularly transparent geometric formulation. We obtain the Noether current and surface charge, clarify the role of the Lagrangian ambiguity related to the cosmological constant, and evaluate the Hamiltonian identity on spacetimes containing a bifurcate Killing horizon. The resulting first-law relation shows that variations of the cosmological constant can contribute nontrivially unless additional physical restrictions are imposed.

Abstract: Nonlinear effects play a fundamental role in the late-time ringdown of black holes, with direct implications for gravitational-wave observations. For massive fields, these dynamics become richer, yet their nonlinear signatures remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically study nonlinear tails of massive scalar perturbations, from a toy model with ingoing and outgoing sources to a self-interacting scalar model, revealing nonlinear tails and contrasting the results with their linear counterparts. We find that the nonlinear tails of massive scalar fields, opposite to massless ones, decay as the same rate as linear tails in the intermediate time, independent of source parameters or initial conditions. Nevertheless, quadratic quasinormal modes could serve as a probe to the nonlinear effects of massive fields.

Abstract: In this work, we show that if the bumblebee field in the Einstein-bumblebee theory is given by its vacuum expectation value ($B_μ=b_μ$) and it is not dynamical ($\partial_μB_ν-\partial_νB_μ=0$), then these conditions uniquely provide a generating technique, allowing us to construct exact solutions to bumblebee gravity from the vacuum solutions by adding a term $\sim b_μb_ν$ to the metric tensor. Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.

Abstract: Due to the tidal forces that a black hole can produce, certain types of compact objects may undergo disruption as they approach the black hole. This disruption point is known as the Roche limit (or Roche radius). In this work, we studied the tidal forces arising from the presence of the Simpson--Visser black bounce. We analyzed the tidal forces both for a static observer and for a radially infalling observer and showed that differences arise depending on the choice of observer. We used the tidal forces together with the stellar binding forces to determine the Roche radius for neutron stars, white dwarfs, and Sun-like stars, and to investigate how the Simpson--Visser regularization affects the tidal disruption of these astrophysical objects. We also examined whether, for astrophysical black holes such as M87* and Sgr~A*, these stellar disruption processes occur inside or outside the event horizon, and thus whether they are observable.
