### [1] [Parameter and hidden-state inference in mean-field models from partial observations of finite-size neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09535)
*Irmantas Ratas,Kestutis Pyragas*

Main category: nlin.CD

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推断未观测的神经网络参数仍是神经科学中的一个重要挑战，对真实神经网络的模拟与实验可以帮助理解大脑神经机制。

Method: 基于极限理论的神经网络模型，结合微分进化算法和同步优化方法，有效恢复了隐藏变量的动态过程。

Result: 模型在两个不同类型的神经网络中均表现优异，网络规模超过1000神经元时，参数恢复相对误差均低于1%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为揭示有限大小神经网络的复杂动态提供了理论基础和技术支持。

Abstract: We study large but finite neural networks that, in the thermodynamic limit, admit an exact low-dimensional mean-field description. We assume that the governing mean-field equations describing macroscopic quantities such as the mean firing rate or mean membrane potential are known, while their parameters are not. Moreover, only a single scalar macroscopic observable from the finite network is assumed to be measurable. Using time-series data of this observable, we infer the unknown parameters of the mean-field equations and reconstruct the dynamics of unobserved (hidden) macroscopic variables. Parameter estimation is carried out using the differential evolution algorithm. To remove the dependence of the loss function on the unknown initial conditions of the hidden variables, we synchronize the mean-field model with the finite network throughout the optimization process. We demonstrate the methodology on two networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons: one exhibiting periodic collective oscillations and another displaying chaotic collective dynamics. In both cases, the parameters are recovered with relative errors below $1\%$ for network sizes exceeding 1000 neurons.

### [2] [Empirical Evaluation of QAOA with Zero Noise Extrapolation on NISQ Hardware for Carbon Credit Portfolio Optimization in the Brazilian Cerrado](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09047)
*Hugo José Ribeiro*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究利用量子近似优化算法（QAOA）结合零噪声外推（ZNE）在巴西 cerrado 生态系统碳信用组合优化中表现出色，显著优于经典贪心策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境保护与气候变化成为全球焦点，碳信用组合优化在生态平衡中至关重要。

Method: 研究采用拉丁超立方体抽样法进行样本选择，基于 ibm_torino 和 ibm_fez 量子处理器的中间规模硬件，利用 QAOA 和 ZNE 方法求解多目标规划问题。

Result: QAOA+ZNE 方法在多次运行中表现出更高的优化效率，显示出统计显著性和较大的效应量，验证了量子技术在环境科学中的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 量子计算技术在解决复杂环境经济问题中具有实际应用价值，尤其是在高生物多样性的生态系统中，量子方法能显著改善当前的碳信用组合优化方案。

Abstract: Optimizing carbon credit portfolios is a critical challenge for climate mitigation, particularly in high-biodiversity biomes such as the Brazilian Cerrado. This study explores the practical application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) combined with Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) to address a multi-objective territorial planning problem. We model an 88-variable portfolio optimization involving carbon sequestration, biodiversity connectivity, and social impact metrics, executed on intermediate-scale IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_torino and ibm_fez). The results of seven independent hardware runs demonstrate that the QAOA+ZNE workflow consistently outperforms a classical greedy baseline. The quantum method achieves a mean portfolio score of 58.47 +/- 6.98, corresponding to a 31.6% improvement over the classical heuristic (44.42), with high statistical significance (p = 0.0009) and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 2.01), where ZNE yields extrapolated expectation values of the portfolio objective rather than a discrete portfolio solution without noise. A validation run conducted after a 13-day interval confirms the temporal stability of the methodology against hardware calibration drifts. These findings establish empirical quantum utility in an environmental science context, showing that current NISQ-era devices, when coupled with rigorous error mitigation, can identify complex territorial synergies that myopic classical approaches overlook. The proposed workflow provides a scalable methodological template for high-precision environmental conservation policies.

### [3] [Universal Foundations of Thermodynamics: Entropy and Energy Beyond Equilibrium and Without Extensivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09986)
*Gian Paolo Beretta*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种普遍的热力学基础，不需要假设系统的size和平衡状态，适合作为所有系统的理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文试图突破传统热力学的限制，扩展其适用范围，特别是在小系统和非平衡状态。

Method: 论文通过操作定义和存在原理，不依赖宏观理想化来构建热力学理论。

Result: 论文提出了新的热力学概念，如adiabatic availability、available energy，并通过能量-熵图表示非平衡态。

Conclusion: 该理论为热力学在各种系统和状态下的统一应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Thermodynamics is commonly presented as a theory of macroscopic systems in stable equilibrium, built upon assumptions of extensivity and scaling with system size. In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications.

### [4] [Volume-law protection of metrological advantage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09086)
*Piotr Wysocki,Jan Chwedeńczuk,Marcin Płodzień*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Entanglement can surpass the standard quantum limit, but particle loss can eliminate the advantage. Scrambling preserves precision by spreading parameter information into many-body correlations. For Haar-random scrambling unitaries, the exact average quantum Fisher information (QFI) after particle loss is calculated. The QFI reaches a threshold: when the remaining subsystem > N/2, full QFI is recovered; otherwise, negligible information is retained. This threshold corresponds to a phase transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement, linked to the growth of the Schmidt rank. Two realizations—brickwork circuit and chaotic XX-chain evolution—are proposed to maintain the precision under particle loss, protecting one-axis-twisted probes even when half the particles are lost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is relevant to the field of quantum metrology and many-body physics. Understanding how to preserve quantum metrological advantage in the presence of particle loss is crucial for practical applications of quantum enhanced sensing.

Method: Exact mathematical analysis of the average quantum Fisher information for the reduced state after tracing out lost particles in Haar-random scrambling unitaries to derive threshold behavior.

Result: A threshold phenomenon is identified where subsystems larger than N/2 retain full quantum Fisher information, while smaller subsystems lose information. This is associated with entanglement transitioning from area-law to volume-law scaling and growth of the Schmidt rank.

Conclusion: Scrambling provides a robust mechanism for protecting metrological precision against particle loss, offering practical solutions for quantum sensing and metrology applications by leveraging subsystem scaling behaviors and many-body entanglement properties.

Abstract: Although entanglement can boost metrological precision beyond the standard quantum limit, the advantage often disappears with particle loss. We demonstrate that scrambling safeguards precision by dispersing information about the encoded parameter into many-body correlations. For Haar-random scrambling unitaries, we derive exact formulas for the average quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state after tracing out lost particles. The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank. We outline two realizations -- a brickwork circuit and chaotic XX-chain evolution -- and demonstrate the protection of one-axis-twisted probes against the loss of up to half of the particles.

TL;DR: 研究证明了均匀随机图G∼G(n,1/2)在高概率下是Ω(√n)-顶点极小万有图，对Claudeure的问题做出了回答。该结果对量子通信网络有直接的应用。我们还通过我们的方法在两个其他情境下实现了该主要成果。我们得到了一个双分部接点极小版本的我们主要的结果，并利用它来推导随机二元电路中的极小万有图的统一性声明。此外，我们引入顶点极小Ramsey数R_{	ext{vm}}(k)，并支持我们的主要结果猜测，该数是关于k的多项式。我们证明了Ω(k^2) ≤ R_{	ext{vm}}(k) ≤ 2^k - 1。

Result: 证明均匀随机图G∼G(n,1/2)是Ω(√n)-顶点极小万有图，并在双分部接点接点中实现了统一性声明，同时界定顶点极小Ramsey数的上限和下限。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了图论在量子通信网络中的应用，提供了新的理论框架和边界估计。

Abstract: Answering a question of Claudet, we prove that the uniformly random graph $G\sim \mathbb G(n, 1/2)$ is $Ω(\sqrt n)$-vertex-minor universal with high probability. That is, for some constant $α\approx 0.911$, any graph on any $α\sqrt n$ specified vertices of $G$ can be obtained as a vertex-minor of $G$. This has direct implications for quantum communications networks: an $n$-vertex $k$-vertex-minor universal graph corresponds to an $n$-qubit $k$-stabilizer universal graph state, which has the property that one can induce any stabilizer state on any $k$ qubits using only local operations and classical communications.
  We further employ our methods in two other contexts. We obtain a bipartite pivot-minor version of our main result, and we use it to derive a universality statement for minors in random binary matroids. We also introduce the vertex-minor Ramsey number $R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k)$ to be the smallest value $n$ such that every $n$-vertex graph contains an independent set of size $k$ as a vertex-minor. Supported by our main result, we conjecture that $R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k)$ is polynomial in $k$. We prove $Ω(k^2) \leq R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k) \leq 2^k - 1$.

### [6] [TC/TCL and NETFD Correspondence Principles for Information Backflow: A Structural Monotonicity Theorem and Minimal Phase Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054)
*Koichi Nakagawa*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一的结构框架来描述最小的非马可夫过程信息回流。它的核心思想是把非马可夫性解释为一种嵌入现象，在这种现象中，观测可以自由与隐藏的辅助领域交换信息。该研究利用了一个非平衡物理学中的标准方法：(i) 投影算子的 master 方程的时卷积（TC）和时卷积无（TCL）形式，以及(ii）非平衡热场动力学（NETFD）的关联原理，后者在扩大空间中动态密度算符的演化中提供一个双倍构造，相当于嵌入。此外，他们定义了一个与信息量 I(t) 相关联的一般信息回流函数 N_I，并基于对称 TCL 生成元的瞬时可除性性质推导出缺失回流的充分条件（N_I = 0）。通过进一步分解回流为经典和内在的热场纠缠贡献，作者能够通过无模型依赖的方式对短暂的超时和 revival 现象进行分类。作为可解析例子的两状态模型的最小经典和量子分析讨论了，他们恢复了Mittag-Leffler分数松弛作为通用上层。以及，他们提供了一种基于TC到TCL转换算法来提取有效速率并产生回流的相图构建。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了如何利用非平衡物理标准技术来分析和理解信息回流的结构，特别是非马可夫过程。他们的方法提供了基础框架和分类工具，适用于广泛的动力学过程研究。

Abstract: We propose a unified structural framework for information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes. The central idea is to interpret non-Markovianity as an embedding phenomenon in which observable degrees of freedom exchange information with hidden auxiliary sectors. Our approach is based on two standard formalisms in nonequilibrium physics: (i) the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator master equations, and (ii) the correspondence principle of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics (NETFD), which provides a doubling construction equivalent to an embedding of density-operator dynamics into a vector evolution in an enlarged space. We define a general information-backflow functional N_I associated with an information quantity I(t) and derive sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow (N_I = 0) in terms of divisibility properties of the instantaneous TCL generator. We further introduce a decomposition of backflow into classical and intrinsic thermo-field entanglement contributions, leading to a classification of transient overshoot and revival phenomena in a model-independent manner. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are discussed as analytically tractable examples, recovering Mittag-Leffler fractional relaxation as a universal envelope. We also provide a constructive TC-to-TCL algorithm for extracting effective rates and producing phase diagrams of backflow.

### [7] [Causal Rigidity of Born-Type Probability Rules in Infinite-Dimensional Operational Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09056)
*Enso O. Torres Alegre*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proves that in certain infinite-dimensional settings, only the Born rule satisfies the operational constraints given as part of the probability rules in operational theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation comes from developing a rigorous framework for probability rules in operational theories, particularly in infinite-dimensional settings, to understand their implications for quantum mechanics and beyond.

Method: The authors consider a class of probability assignment functions based on operational transition probabilities between pure states. They impose three requirements: no superluminal signaling, operational steering via purification, and countable mixture continuity. Using these conditions, they show that the Born rule is the unique solution.

Result: The detailed proof demonstrates that the Born rule is the only probability rule compatible with these operational constraints in infinite-dimensional systems.

Conclusion: This finding reinforces the uniqueness of the Born rule in quantum mechanics and provides constraints for modifications in post-quantum theories.

Abstract: We establish an operational rigidity result for a broad class of probability rules in infinite-dimensional settings, applicable under normality and steering assumptions. Starting from a topological generalization of generalized probabilistic theories, we consider probability assignments defined as functions of an operational transition probability between pure states. We show that under three operationally motivated requirements: no superluminal signaling, availability of normal steering via purification in a sigma additive sense, and sigma affinity of probabilities under countable preparation mixtures, any admissible rule within this class must reduce to the identity. In particular, nonlinear deviations generically enable operational signaling distinctions in steering scenarios, while continuity combined with sigma affinity excludes non affine alternatives. This identifies a unique causal fixed point. Within this class of probability rules, the Born rule emerges as the only assignment compatible with no signaling in operational theories admitting normal steering. We connect the operational result to standard infinite-dimensional quantum mechanics through the normal state space of von Neumann algebras and the GNS representation, recovering the conventional Born rule for projective and generalized measurements. We discuss the scope of the assumptions and implications for proposed post quantum modifications in continuous variable and quantum field theoretic regimes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Estimating delay tail probabilities in scheduling and load balancing systems is a critical but computationally prohibitive task due to the rarity of violation events. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers a generic quadratic reduction in sample complexity 1/sqrt(p) vs 1/p, but applying it to steady-state queueing networks in challenging: classical simulations involve unbounded state spaces and random regeneration cycles, whereas quantum circuits have fixed depth and finite registers.
  In this paper, we develop a framework for quantum simulation of delay tail probabilities based on truncated regenerative simulation. We show that regenerative rare-event estimators can be reformulated as deterministic, reversible functions of finite random seeds by truncating regeneration cycles. To control the resulting bias, we use Lyapunov drift and concentration arguments to derive exponential tail bounds on regeneration times. This allows the truncation horizon--and hence the quantum circuit depth--to be chosen such that the bias is provably negligible compared to the statistical error. The proposed framework enables quantum estimation in models with countably infinite state spaces, avoiding the challenge of determining the sufficient mixing time required for direct finite-horizon simulation. We provide bounds on qubit and circuit complexity for a GI-GI-1 queue, a wireless network under MaxWeight scheduling, and a multi-server system with Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) routing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding thermodynamics far from equilibrium at the quantum scale remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in the presence of quantum coherence. Here we develop a first-principles framework for nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics by integrating quantum resource theory of coherence with thermodynamic laws. We derive a previously unexplored entropy balance relation that explicitly separates entropy flux due to heat exchange from entropy production arising from the loss of quantum coherence. This formulation identifies the appropriate thermodynamic entropy in nonequilibrium quantum processes as the energy entropy associated with energy measurements, demonstrating that the von Neumann entropy does not, in general, represent thermodynamic entropy away from equilibrium. Within this framework, dynamical temperature, free energy, work, and heat are consistently defined, and both the first and second laws are shown to hold far from equilibrium. Applying the theory to an exactly solvable open quantum system, we reveal how equilibrium thermodynamics emerges dynamically in the weak-coupling limit. Our results establish a unified and operational foundation for nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and clarify the fundamental thermodynamic role of quantum coherence.

### [10] [Eigenstate Thermalization for Local versus Translationally Invariant Observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09087)
*Rohit Patil,Marcos Rigol*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 局部可观察量和其平移不变量在实验测量中预测相同，此结论不仅适用于期望值（在干净系统内有限尺寸效应内有效），也适用于关联函数，但两者并不完全一致。我们从层状热化假设出发探讨这类可观察量的对角矩阵元及谱函数，分析其在具有周期和开边界条件的旋转量子Ising链中的异同，并讨论何时可认为这些可观察量相同。我们还揭示了平移不变系统中一种新的单纯热化现象，其适用于不同动量态的两组量子态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对于量子可观察量与其平移不变量间的联系，层状热化假设提供了一个有效的视角。探索其对角矩阵元与谱函数在不同边界条件下表现差异，有助于更深刻理解这两类量在不同物理量与基于动量的量子态中的表现。

Method: 通过构造特定的量子Ising链模型，运用数值模拟和解析方法分析对角矩阵元的性质，并考察其与系统边界条件的关系，进一步研究谱函数的特性。

Result: 我们发现，尽管局部量和其平移不变量在 clean 系统中的期望值一致，但其关联函数在每种边界条件下的平移不变量都呈现出独特的对称性。进一步地，通过构造一种新形式的单纯热化现象，我们展示了对于平移不变系 统，在不同能量层状结构中如何实现类似单纯的热化行为。

Conclusion: 局部可观察量和其平移不变量确实能在实验测量中被视作等价，但在相关的关联函数中却并非完全一致。通过对角矩阵元和谱函数分析，我们准确刻画了在不同边界条件下的衍生效应，同时发现了单纯热化现象在平移不变系统中的新角色。

Abstract: Local observables and their translationally invariant counterparts are generally thought as providing the same predictions for experimental measurements. This is used in the context of their expectation values, which are indeed the same in clean systems (up to finite-size effects), but also in the context of their correlation functions, which need not be the same. We examine this intuition from the perspective of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Specifically, we explore the diagonal matrix elements and the spectral functions of local and translationally invariant observables in the spin-1 tilted field Ising chain with periodic and open boundary conditions. We discuss in which ways those observables are different and in which contexts they can be thought as being the same. Furthermore, we unveil a novel form of off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization in translationally invariant systems that applies to pairs of energy eigenstates with different quasimomenta.

Motivation: 理解对称性对量子相变动力学的影响是开放量子系统研究的重要方面。

Method: 使用Keldysh环路和累积量展开进行数值模拟。

Result: 弱对称性和强对称性导致不同的临界缩放行为，尽管闭合系统中来自同一对称群。

Conclusion: 强的对称性会根本重塑耗散性相变。

Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions are strongly shaped by the symmetries of the Liouvillian, yet the quantitative impact of weak and strong symmetries on critical behavior has remained unclear. We study a squeezed-photon model with single- and two-photon losses, realizing weak and strong symmetries in the simplest possible setting. The two symmetries exhibit identical Gaussian static fluctuations, whereas the order parameter and the asymptotic decay rate display distinct scaling behaviors. Our one-loop Keldysh analysis, together with cumulant-expansion numerics, reveals sharply different critical scaling with respect to the thermodynamic scaling parameter. This establishes that weak and strong symmetries lead to distinct dynamical universality classes despite originating from the same symmetry group in the closed system. Our results provide a clear quantitative demonstration that strong symmetries fundamentally reshape dissipative criticality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the rotated surface code, hook errors (errors on auxiliary qubits midway through syndrome extraction that propagate to correlated two-qubit data errors) can reduce the circuit-level code distance by a factor of two if the extraction schedule is poorly chosen. The traditional approach uses N-shaped and Z-shaped schedules, selecting the orientation in each plaquette to avoid hook errors aligned with logical operators. However, this becomes increasingly complex within lattice surgery primitives with varied boundary geometries, and requires a 7-step schedule to avoid gate collisions. We propose the diagonal schedule, which orients hook errors along the diagonal of each plaquette. These diagonal errors crucially never align with logical operators regardless of boundary orientation, achieving full code distance. The diagonal schedule is globally uniform: all X-type plaquettes use one schedule and all Z-type plaquettes use another, eliminating geometry-dependent planning. On hardware supporting parallel measurement, reset, and gate operations, the schedule achieves a minimal period of 6 time steps, compared to 7 for the traditional approach. We demonstrate effectiveness for memory experiments, spatial junctions, spatial Hadamard gates, and patch rotation, showing equivalent or improved logical error rates while simplifying circuit construction.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fault-tolerant capacities quantify the ability of a quantum channel to reliably transmit information when every component of the encoding and decoding procedure is noisy. Earlier work analyzed achievable communication rates under such noise using fault-tolerant implementations based on concatenated codes with a single logical qubit. In this work, we develop an alternative approach using concatenations of quantum Hamming codes, which offer constant space overhead by encoding many logical qubits simultaneously. We introduce modular techniques for implementing fault-tolerant circuits with quantum input/output interfaces using the concatenated quantum Hamming code. These tools enable an analysis of fault-tolerant entanglement-assisted communication that is not only simpler, but also yields substantially higher achievable communication rates than previous methods, owing to the limited noise correlations in syndrome qubits of high-rate quantum Hamming codes.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新方法称为Quantum Phaselift，用于估计量子时间序列，如洛施米特幅度，避免了传统方法对硬件时间深度的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的量子时间序列在光谱学、动力系统和量子相位估计中占据重要地位，但直接估计面临硬件时间深度的限制。

Method: 提出了量子相位提升框架，通过估计秩一矩阵Z = ff†，而不是直接估计f。使用简单的量子电路估计Z的对角附近条带，恢复f而不依赖于时间t的深度。

Result: 通过三种恢复算法，可以在噪声情况下稳定恢复信号。在100时间和2D模型中使用几百万测量次数和合理后处理实现高保真度恢复。

Conclusion: Quantum Phaselift显著减少了对硬件的依赖，使时间序列估计在近端设备上更可行。

Abstract: Estimating quantum time-series such as the Loschmidt amplitude $f(t)=\langleψ|\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}Ht}|ψ\rangle$ is central to spectroscopy, Hamiltonian analysis, and many phase-estimation algorithms. Direct estimation via the Hadamard test requires controlled implementations of $\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}Ht}$, and the depth of these controlled circuits grows with $t$, making long-time estimation challenging on near-term hardware. We introduce Quantum Phaselift, a lifting-based framework that estimates the rank-one matrix $Z = f f^\dagger$ rather than estimating $f$ directly. We propose simple quantum circuits for estimating the entries of $Z$ and show that measuring only a narrow band of this matrix around the diagonal is sufficient to uniquely recover $f$. Crucially, this reformulation decouples the controlled circuit depth from the maximum evolution time to scale instead with the width of the measured band. We prove that a $O(1)$ bandwidth suffices for generic signals, leading to substantial savings in controlled operations compared to direct estimation methods. We develop three recovery algorithms with provable exact recovery in the noiseless setting and stability under measurement noise. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that high-quality recovery is possible for the 2D Fermi-Hubbard and 2D transverse-field Ising model signals of size exceeding 100 time points using only a few million measurement shots and reasonable post-processing time, making our time-series estimation techniques efficient and effective for near-term implementations.

Abstract: Although gravitational waves are now routinely observed, the detection of individual gravitons has long been regarded as impossible. Recent work, however, has demonstrated that single-graviton detection can be achieved and may be feasible in the near future. Here we show that beyond mere particle detection, these detectors provide access to the quantum state and particle statistics of gravitational waves. We show that graviton detection probabilities enable the discrimination between squeezed, coherent, and thermal radiation. We further demonstrate that the full quantum statistics contained in the second-order correlation function of the passing wave can be directly measured at the detector, independent of the weak gravitational interaction strength. Building on recent quantum-optical techniques, this capability opens the way to full quantum state tomography of Gaussian states. Our results demonstrate that single-graviton detection is not only of foundational significance but also of practical value, allowing for the characterization of quantum statistics and the states of the gravitational radiation field, which remain currently unknown.

### [17] [Quantum Correlation Dynamics Subjected to Quantum Reset-Driven Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09348)
*R. Jafari,Ali Asadian,Mehdi Biderang,Alireza Akbari*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses how environmental quantum reset affects the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord in a system of two qubits interacting with a driven Ising chain. Environmental reset impairs quantum correlations, but entanglement in a strongly coupled system LCs shows revivals, though their strength decreases with higher reset rates. Weak coupling and absence of reset lead to monotonic decay of quantum correlations. Additive quantum reset causes oscillatory suppression in both entanglement and discord with suppressed oscillation periods for faster reset rates or longer drive durations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of environmental disturbances on quantum correlations is important in quantum information and quantum computing applications, where maintaining quantum states is crucial.

Method: The authors numerically simulate a system of two qubits interacting with a driven Ising chain that randomly resets back to its initial state. They analyze the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord under different coupling conditions and disturbance frequencies.

Result: In the strong coupling scenario, revivals of entanglement and discord are observed when the system is reset, though their magnitude decreases with higher resetting rates. In weak coupling without resetting, quantum correlations decay monotonically after the drive crosses its second quantum critical point. With both weak coupling and resetting, both entanglement and discord experience oscillatory behavior and suppression.

Conclusion: Environmental reset significantly degrades quantum correlations. While severe resetting can cause pronounced oscillations in the decay of entanglement in strongly coupled systems, the mechanism for less severe resetting is less clear, though the conclusions presented align with the data and simulations performed.

Abstract: We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.

Abstract: The many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics poses a simple question. What would reality look like if everything evolved in time according to the same quantum equations? There is an attractive consistency to treating microscopic objects, measuring devices, and observers all on the same footing, but do the predictions match our observations? Here, we build a model for a bolometer detector making a which-path measurement in an atom interferometer. We discuss the MWI claim that, while both measurement outcomes occur in each experimental iteration, an observer will experience only one outcome or the other, with a probability consistent with experiment. Finally, we discuss how MWI does not have action at a distance. This article is written to be accessible to anyone with an undergraduate course in quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: 本文的框架不仅解释了CSC现象，还展示了在某些情况下，即使缺乏例外点也能观察到CSC。

Abstract: Adiabatic chiral state conversion (CSC) is one of the many counterintuitive effects associated with non-Hermitian physics. In quantum systems, numerous works have demonstrated this phenomenon under both non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindblad evolution. However, despite considerable progress, the physical mechanism behind it has been a subject of debate. In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Existing protocols for classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) consume the prover's witness state, requiring a new witness state for each invocation. Because QMA witnesses are not generally clonable, destroying the input witness means that amplifying soundness and completeness via repetition requires many copies of the witness. Building CVQC with low soundness error that uses only *one* copy of the witness has remained an open problem so far.
  We resolve this problem by constructing a CVQC that uses a single copy of the QMA witness, has negligible completeness and soundness errors, and does *not* destroy its witness. The soundness of our CVQC is based on the post-quantum Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption.
  To obtain this result, we define and construct two primitives (under the post-quantum LWE assumption) for non-destructively handling superpositions of classical data, which we believe are of independent interest:
  - A *state preserving* classical argument for NP.
  - Dual-mode trapdoor functions with *state recovery*.

Abstract: We provide explicit constant-depth local unitary circuits that realize general anyon permutations in Kitaev's quantum double models. This construction can be naturally understood through a correspondence between anyon permutation symmetries of two-dimensional topological orders and self-dualities in one-dimensional systems, where local gates implement self-duality transformations on the boundaries of microscopic regions. From this holographic perspective, general anyon permutations in the $D(G)$ quantum double correspond to compositions of three classes of one-dimensional self-dualities, including gauging of certain subgroups of $G$, stacking with $G$ symmetry-protected topological phases, and outer automorphisms of the group $G$. We construct circuits realizing the first class by employing self-dual unitary gauging maps, and present transversal circuits for the latter two classes.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and hybrid quantum-classical extensions provide a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into the learning process. In this work, we study embedding strategies for trainable embedding quantum physics-informed neural networks (TE-QPINNs) in the context of nonlinear reaction-diffusion (RD) systems. We introduce an extended TE-QPINN (x-TE-QPINN) architecture that supports both classical and fully quantum embeddings, enabling a controlled comparison between feedforward neural network-based feature maps and parameterized quantum circuit embeddings. The first architecture is the classical embedding feed-forward neural network-based TE-QPINN (FNN-TE-QPINN), while the latter variant is a purely quantum one, referred to as quantum embedding neural network-based TE-QPINN (QNN-TE-QPINN). The proposed framework employs hardware-efficient variational quantum circuits and species-specific readout operators to approximate coupled multi-field dynamics while enforcing governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions through a physics-informed loss function. By isolating the embedding mechanism while keeping the variational ansatz, loss formulation, and optimization procedure fixed, we analyze the impact of embedding design on gradient structure, parameter scaling, and quantum resource requirements. Numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional RD equations demonstrate that quantum embeddings can replace classical embeddings without degradation in solution accuracy and, in certain regimes, exhibit improved optimization behavior compared to classical PINNs and hybrid quantum models with fixed embeddings. These results provide architectural insight into hybrid quantum PDE solvers and inform the design of resource-efficient quantum physics-informed learning methods.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the design of the checkpointing and restoration for quantum HPC that leverages dynamic circuit technology to enable restartable and resilient quantum execution. Rather than attempting to checkpoint quantum states, our approach redefines checkpointing as a control flow and algorithmic state problem. By exploiting mid-circuit measurements, classical feed forward, and conditional execution supported by dynamic circuits, we capture sufficient program state to allow correct restoration of quantum workflows after interruption or failure. This design aligns naturally with iterative and staged quantum algorithms such as variational eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization, and time-stepping methods commonly used in quantum simulation and scientific computing.

Abstract: The spin-dynamics of two alkali atoms in an optical tweezer is driven by spin-changing collisions that couple the spin-state of the atoms to their relative motion. This paper experimentally studies the resulting spin-states when the relative motion is in a thermal state with k B T much larger than the energies of the spin-states that take part in the dynamics. We find that an initially unentangled spin-state can evolve into an entangled state. This is contrary to the common case when coupling a quantum system to hot degrees of freedom leads to loss of entanglement and not its generation. Moreover, we show that the generated entanglement is technologically useful as it, in principle, can enhance the sensitivity of measurements beyond the standard quantum limit. This may provide a promising avenue for robust entanglement generation for future technologies.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) is a key application of the quantum internet. We report the realization of DI-QKD between two single-atom nodes linked by 100-km fibers. To improve the entangling rate, single-photon interference is leveraged for entanglement heralding, and quantum frequency conversion is used to reduce fiber loss. A tailored Rydberg-based emission scheme suppresses the photon recoil effect on the atom without introducing noise. We achieved high-fidelity atom-atom entanglement and positive asymptotic key rates for fiber lengths up to 100 km. At 11 km, 1.2 million heralded Bell pairs were prepared over 624 hours, yielding an estimated extractable finite-size secure key rate of 0.112 bits per event against general attacks. Our results close the gap between proof-of-principle quantum network experiments and real-world applications.

Abstract: We show that the quantum Fisher information about any phase parameter encoded in a family of pure quantum states can be faithfully compressed into a single qubit, accompanied by a logarithmic amount of classical bits. When the phase is encoded into many identical copies of a qubit state on the equator of the Bloch sphere, we show that the compression can be implemented sequentially, by iteratively compressing pairs of qubits into a single qubit. We experimentally demonstrate this building block in a photonic setup, developing two alternative compression strategies, based on Type-I fusion gate and a postselected implementation of the CNOT gate.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance quantum-assisted black-box optimization by modeling higher-order variable interactions in learned energy landscapes, improving structural diversity and extreme case discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box optimization under budget constraints is challenging, especially when seeking high-utility and diverse solutions. This paper addresses this by leveraging quantum computing techniques, specifically QAOA, to aid in the discovery process in such constrained environments.

Method: The authors extend a surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by incorporating self-attention to model higher-order variable dependencies, projecting them into a positive semi-definite quadratic form suitable for QAOA.

Result: The method outperforms classical baselines in discovering risk outliers, particularly in extreme cases, showing twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers and exclusive high-utility configurations.

Conclusion: This approach successfully combines quantum computing with machine learning to enhance black-box optimization, particularly in discovering rare and diverse high-utility configurations.

Abstract: Discovering configurations that are both high-utility and structurally diverse under expensive black-box evaluation and strict query budgets remains a central challenge in data-driven discovery. Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery.

Result: 揭示了弱值解释中的逻辑问题。

Conclusion: 支持实验检验弱值解释的有效性。

Abstract: In quantum theory, a weak value is a complex number with a somewhat technical definition: it is a ratio whose numerator is the matrix element of a self-adjoint operator and whose denominator is the inner product of a corresponding pair of state vectors. Weak values first appeared in the research literature in a pair of papers in 1987 and 1988, and were originally defined as the results of a special kind of experimental protocol involving non-disturbing measurements combined with an explicit form of post-selection. In the years since, subsequent papers on weak values have produced a number of important practical spin-offs, including new methods for signal amplification and quantum-state tomography. The present work is not concerned with those practical spin-offs, but with historical and ongoing attempts to assign weak values a transparent, single-system interpretation, as well as efforts that invoke weak values to make a number of exotic claims about the properties and behavior of individual quantum systems. This paper challenges these interpretational claims by arguing that they involve several forms of fallacious reasoning.

Abstract: We show an unconditional classical oracle separation between the class of languages that can be verified using a quantum proof ($\mathsf{QMA}$) and the class of languages that can be verified with a classical proof ($\mathsf{QCMA}$).

In particular, our techniques yield the first unconditional classical oracle separation between the class of languages that can be decided with quantum advice ($\mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}$) and the class of languages that can be decided with classical advice ($\mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{poly}$), improving on the quantum oracle separation of Aaronson and Kuperberg (CCC 2007) and the classically-accessible classical oracle separation of Li, Liu, Pelecanos and Yamakawa (ITCS 2024).
  Our oracles are based on the code intersection problem introduced by Yamakawa and Zhandry (FOCS 2022), combined with codes that have extremely good list-recovery properties.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Implementation of quantum logic gates with linear optical elements plays a prominent role in quantum computing due to the relatively easier manipulation and realization. We present efficient schemes to implement controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate by solely using linear optics. We encode the control qubits and target qudits in photonic polarization (two-level) and spatial degrees of freedom ($d$-level), respectively. Based on the hybrid encoding, CNOT and Fredkin gates are constructed in a deterministic way without any borrowed ancillary photons or measurement-induced nonlinearities. Remarkably, the number of linear optics required to implement a CNOT gate has been reduced to one polarization beam splitter (PBS), while only $d$ PBSs are necessary to implement a generalized Fredkin gate. The optical depths of all schemes are reduced to one and dimension-independent. Besides, the fidelity of our three-qubit Fredkin gate is higher than 99.7\% under realistic conditions, which is higher than the previous schemes.

Abstract: We study the following task: Alice is given a classical description of a rank-$k$ projector $P$ on $\mathbb{C}^d$, and Alice and Bob want to prepare the quantum state $P/k$ on Bob's side using shared entanglement and classical communication. The general form of this task is known as remote state preparation (RSP). We give nearly-matching lower and upper bounds for the entanglement cost and communication cost for RSP of the states $P/k$. Ours are the first nearly matching upper and lower bounds for RSP of mixed states, and in the special case of pure states, our lower bound outperforms the best previously known lower bound. Our results show that any pure entangled state that can be used to do RSP of these states with $o(d)$ bits of communication, can distill $\log d$ ebits of entanglement, and conversely, any state that can distill $\log d$ ebits of entanglement can be used to do RSP of these states efficiently. As applications of our results, we rederive a previously-known incompressibility result for states of the form $P/k$, and give a new entanglement-assisted communication protocol for the equality function that uses $\frac{1}{2}\log n + O(1)$ many ebits, and $O(1)$ communication.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum advantage in quantum illumination using two-qubit mixed states as the initial resource. We show that in quantum illumination, the achievable advantage is determined by an interplay between initial entanglement and discord. First, we rigorously show that the quantum advantage for a given state equals the amount of discord consumed for illumination. Subsequently, we find that states with identical initial discord can lead to varying advantages, indicating that the usable portion of discord for illumination depends on additional structural features of the state. Then, we consider the relation between the advantage and both entanglement and discord by performing a conditional extremal analysis. To this end, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial discord, we compute the maximum and minimum initial entanglement within each cluster. We demonstrate that, for states with fixed initial discord, the maximum (and not minimum) entanglement increases by increment of the advantage. We conclude that for any given initial discord, higher entanglement is a sufficient (but not necessary) resource for higher advantage. On the other hand, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial entanglement, we compute the maximum and minimum initial discord in each group. Here, the minimum (and not always maximum) discord scales monotonically with advantage. It shows that, for fixed initial entanglement, higher discord is a necessary (but not always sufficient) resource for higher advantage. This result provides a refined, operational perspective on how different forms of quantum correlations govern the performance of the illumination protocol. We finally find a persistent linear dependence of the advantage on initial discord in the high-noise regime, highlighting discord as the key resource for resilience to noise in the protocol.

TL;DR: Article discusses challenges in preparing discrete-variable quantum states using linear optics and measurements, and presents a method using the Nullstellensatz Linear Algebra algorithm to determine the feasibility of state transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photonic quantum technologies face a major challenge in efficiently preparing suitable quantum states. The lack of deterministic non-linear operations in linear optics complicates this process, necessitating alternative probabilistic methods.

Method: The authors propose using the Nullstellensatz Linear Algebra algorithm from algebraic geometry to address the feasibility of transforming input states into target states through linear optical networks and photon measurements. This algorithm provides a systematic way to determine if a given state transformation is possible.

Result: The methodology is successfully applied to validate the feasibility of transforming into several common optical states and gates. The results establish lower bounds on the physical resources required for their realization, offering a benchmark for future quantum technology developments.

Conclusion: By leveraging algebraic geometry techniques, the study provides a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing quantum state generation in photonic systems. This approach not only confirms existing knowledge but also paves the way for advancing quantum technologies by setting clear resource requirements for essential quantum operations.

Abstract: A major challenge in photonic quantum technologies is developing strategies to prepare suitable discrete-variable quantum states using simple input states, linear optics, and auxiliary photon measurements to identify successful outcomes. Fundamentally, this challenge arises from the lack of strong non-linearities on the single-photon level, meaning that photonic state preparation based on linear optics cannot benefit from the deterministic gate-based approach available to other physical platforms. Instead, the preparation of quantum states can be probabilistically implemented using single photons, linear-optical networks, and photon detection. However, determining whether an input state can be transformed into a target state using a specific measurement pattern - a problem that can be mapped to deciding the feasibility of a system of polynomial equations - is a complex problem in general. To solve it, we apply the Nullstellensatz Linear Algebra algorithm from algebraic geometry to quantum state generation; this can provide definitive no-go results by proving infeasibility when the state preparation task in question has no solution. We demonstrate this capability to validate and establish lower bounds on the physical resource requirements for the realization of several ubiquitous optical states and gates.

*Ozgur Ercetin,Zafer Gedik*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new metric called Fidelity-Age (FA) to measure the freshness of entanglement in quantum repeater networks while, for entanglement states that meet a minimum fidelity threshold (Fmin), providing a control framework to optimize this freshness under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It is crucial in quantum networks to maintain the quality and timeliness of quantum entanglement resources for quantum communication and computation tasks. The existing focus on throughput and fidelity may not adequately address the necessity of timely and reliable delivery of entangled pairs.

Method: The authors propose the Fidelity-Age (FA) metric, which quantifies the time (FA) elapsed since the last delivery of a Bell pair with fidelity above a threshold Fmin. They employ a stochastic control problem to link slot-level success probability to long-term average FA. Two lightweight schedulers, FA-THR and FA-INDEX, are developed and tested on slotted repeater grids, demonstrating the trade-offs between FA, throughput, and memory requirements through simulations.

Result: The results show that FA-THR and FA-INDEX effectively reduce the Fidelity-Age by up to two orders of magnitude compared to existing scheduling strategies, while maintaining the throughput. This highlights the FA metric's effectiveness in managing the freshness of entanglement in quantum networks.

Conclusion: The introduction of Fidelity-Age as a metric and the development of scheduling algorithms that optimize the timely delivery of high-fidelity entangled pairs under resource constraints position this work as a significant advancement in managing the critical issue of fresh entanglement in quantum repeater networks. The findings offer practical solutions for reliable and timely entanglement delivery, enhancing the overall functionality and usability of quantum communication networks.

Abstract: Quantum repeater networks distribute entanglement over long distances but must balance fidelity, delay, and resource contention. Prior work optimized throughput and end-to-end fidelity, yet little attention has been paid to the freshness of entanglement-the time since a usable Bell pair was last delivered. We introduce the Fidelity-Age (FA) metric, which measures this interval for states whose fidelity exceeds a threshold Fmin. A renewal formulation links slot-level success probability to long-run average FA, enabling a stochastic control problem that minimizes FA under budget and memory limits. Two lightweight schedulers, FA-THR and FA-INDEX, approximate Lyapunov-drift-optimal control. Simulations on slotted repeater grids show that FA-aware scheduling preserves throughput while reducing extreme-age events by up to two orders of magnitude. Fidelity-Age thus provides a tractable, physically grounded metric for reliable and timely entanglement delivery in quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum simulation of the linear non-unitary dynamics is crucial in scientific computing. In this work, we establish a generic framework, referred to as the Amplitude-Phase Separation (APS) methods, which formulates any non-unitary evolution into separate simulation of a unitary operator and a Hermitian operator, thus allow one to take best advantage of, and to even improve existing algorithms, developed for unitary or Hermitian evolution respectively. We utilize two techniques: the first achieves a provably optimal query complexity via a shifted Dyson series; the second breaks the conventional linear dependency, achieving fast-forwarding by exhibiting a square-root dependence on the norm of the dissipative part. Furthermore, one can derive existing methods such as the LCHS (Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation) and the NDME (Non-Diagonal Density Matrix Encoding) methods from APS. The APS provides an effective and generic pathway for developing efficient quantum algorithms for general non-unitary dynamics to achieve either optimal query complexity or fast-forwarding property, outperforming the existing algorithms for the same problems.

Abstract: In this work, we study Bayesian quantum parameter estimation given a finite number of uses of the process encoding one or more unknown physical quantities. For multiple uses, it is conventional to classify quantum metrological protocols as parallel, sequential, or indefinite causal order. Within each class, the central question is to determine the optimal strategy -- namely, the choice of optimal input state, control operations, measurement, and estimator(s) -- to perform the estimation task. Using the formalism of higher-order operations, we develop an algorithm that looks for the optimal solution, and we provide an efficient numerical implementation based on semidefinite programming. Our benchmark examples, specifically those against existing analytical solutions, demonstrate how powerful and precise our method is. We further explore the potential of greedy adaptive strategies, which are based on classical feedforward to design the optimal protocol for the next round. Using this framework, we compare the optimal achievable Bayesian score across classes. We demonstrate the strength of our algorithm in several examples, from single to multiparameter estimation and with various prior distributions. Particularly, we find examples in which there is a strict hierarchy between different classes. Nonetheless, the performance of the different quantum memory-assisted classes are not significantly different, while they may significantly outperform the adaptive greedy strategy.

Abstract: Thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems can be nonmonotonic, with its process dependent on an initial state. We propose a numerical method to construct a low-entangled initial state that creates a ``burst''$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$a transient deviation of an observable from its thermal equilibrium value$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$at a designated time. We apply this method to demonstrate that a burst of magnetization can be realized for a nonintegrable mixed-field Ising chain on a timescale comparable to the onset of quantum scrambling. Contrary to the typical spreading of information in this regime, the created burst is accompanied by a slow or even negative entanglement growth. Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time. Our results suggest that a nonequilibrium state is maintained for an appropriately chosen initial state until scrambling becomes dominant. These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators.

Abstract: Solving large-scale linear systems problems is a central task in scientific and industrial computing. Classical iterative solvers face increasing difficulty as the number of unknowns becomes large, while fully quantum linear solvers require fault-tolerant resources that remain far beyond near-term feasibility. Here we propose a quantum-accelerated conjugate gradient (QACG) framework in which a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm is used exclusively to construct a spectrally informed initial guess for a classical conjugate gradient (CG) solver. Rather than replacing classical kernels, the quantum subroutine functions as a cooperative accelerator that selectively suppresses low-energy spectral components responsible for slow classical convergence. We analyze the total runtime and resource requirements of this integrated quantum-HPC platform for the 3D Poisson equation. A central feature of QACG is a controllable decomposition of the condition number between the quantum and the classical solver, enabling flexible allocation of computational effort across quantum and classical resources. Under explicit architectural assumptions, we identify regimes in which this cooperative strategy yields a runtime advantage over purely classical approaches while requiring substantially fewer quantum resources than end-to-end quantum linear solvers. These results illustrate a concrete pathway toward the scientific and industrial use of early-stage fault-tolerant quantum computing and point to a scalable hybrid paradigm in which quantum devices act as accelerators within high-performance computing workflows rather than as standalone replacements.

Abstract: Direct fidelity estimation (DFE) is a famous tool for estimating the fidelity with a target pure state. However, such a method generally requires exponentially many sampling copies due to the large magic of the target state. This work proposes a sample- and gate-efficient fidelity estimation algorithm that is affordable within feasible quantum devices. We show that the fidelity estimation with pure states close to the structure of phase states, for which sample-efficient DFE is limited by their strong entanglement and magic, can be done by using $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ sampling copies, with a single $n$-qubit fan-out gate. As the target state becomes a phase state, the sampling complexity reaches $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Such a drastic improvement stems from a crucial step in our scheme, the so-called phase stripping, which can significantly reduce the target-state magic. Furthermore, we convert a complex diagonal gate resource, which is needed to design a phase-stripping-adapted algorithm, into nonlinear classical post-processing of Pauli measurements so that we only require a single fan-out gate. Additionally, as another variant using the nonlinear post-processing, we propose a nonlinear extension of the conventional DFE scheme. Here, the sampling reduction compared to DFE is also guaranteed, while preserving the Pauli measurement as the only circuit resource. We expect our work to contribute to establishing noise-resilient quantum algorithms by enabling a significant reduction in sampling overhead for fidelity estimation under the restricted gate resources, and ultimately to clarifying a fundamental gap between the resource overhead required to understand complex physical properties and that required to generate them.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML), as an interdisciplinary field bridging quantum computing and machine learning, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Currently, the field as a whole faces challenges due to incomplete theoretical foundations for the expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs). In this paper we propose a constructive QNN model and demonstrate that it possesses the universal approximation property (UAP), which means it can approximate any square-integrable function up to arbitrary accuracy. Furthermore, it supports switching function bases, thus adaptable to various scenarios in numerical approximation and machine learning. Our model has asymptotic advantages over the best classical feed-forward neural networks in terms of circuit size and achieves optimal parameter complexity when approximating Sobolev functions under $L_2$ norm.

Abstract: The reliable characterization of quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information science. For this purpose, quantum state tomography provides a standard framework for reconstructing quantum states from measurement data, yet it is often degraded by experimental noise. Mitigating such noise is therefore essential for the accurate estimation of the states in realistic settings. In this work, we propose a scalable tomography method based on multilayer perceptron networks that mitigate unknown noise through supervised learning. This approach is data-driven and thus does not rely on explicit assumptions about the noise model or measurement, making it readily extendable to general quantum systems. Numerical simulations, ranging from special pure states to random mixed states, demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates noise across a broad range of scenarios, compared with the case without mitigation.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，探索其在解决线性方程组中的应用成为研究热点。然而，现有量子算法多局限于稀疏矩阵，而实际应用中常遇到稠密矩阵。因此，扩展量子算法的应用范围是当前的重要研究方向。

Abstract: While quantum algorithms for solving large scale systems of linear equations offer potential speedups, their application has largely been confined to sparse matrices. This work extends the scope of these algorithms to a broad class of structured dense matrices arise in potential theory, covariance modeling, and computational physics, namely, hierarchically block separable (HBS) matrices. We develop two distinct methods to make these systems amenable to quantum solvers. The first is a pre-processing approach that transforms the dense matrix into a larger but sparse format. The second is a direct block encoding scheme that recursively constructs the necessary oracles from the HBS structure. We provide a detailed complexity analysis and rigorous error bounds for both methods. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of our approaches.

Motivation: The discussants aim to bring attention to the lack of logical rigor in the debate on quantum nonlocality, calling for greater scrutiny of the rationales behind widely accepted ideas.

Method: The authors conduct a critical analysis of the arguments presented in the debate, evaluating the logical consistency and rationality of the arguments advanced by different sides.

Strong convictions often prevail over rational assessment, leading to the acceptance of loose ideas that become entrenched dogmas. The lack of sound rationales and adherence to the rules of logical inference lead to widely adopted antinomies that receive little conceptual scrutiny.

Abstract: To build large-scale quantum computers while minimizing resource requirements, one may want to use high-rate quantum error-correcting codes that can efficiently encode information. However, realizing an addressable gate$\unicode{x2014}$a logical gate on a subset of logical qubits within a high-rate code$\unicode{x2014}$in a fault-tolerant manner can be challenging and may require ancilla qubits. Transversal and fold-transversal gates could provide a means to fault-tolerantly implement logical gates using a constant-depth circuit without ancilla qubits, but available gates of these types could be limited depending on the code and might not be addressable. In this work, we study a family of $[\![n=2^m,k={m \choose m/2}\approx n/\sqrt{π\log_2(n)/2},d=2^{m/2}=\sqrt{n}]\!]$ self-dual quantum Reed$\unicode{x2013}$Muller codes, where $m$ is a positive even number. For any code in this family, we construct a generating set of the full logical Clifford group comprising only transversal and fold-transversal gates, thus enabling the implementation of any addressable Clifford gate. To our knowledge, this is the first known construction of the full logical Clifford group for a family of codes in which $k$ grows near-linearly in $n$ up to a $1/\sqrt{\log n}$ factor that uses only transversal and fold-transversal gates without requiring ancilla qubits.

Abstract: We investigate the structure of $k$-positivity and Schmidt numbers for classes of linear maps and bipartite quantum states exhibiting symplectic group symmetry. Specifically, we consider (1) linear maps on $M_d(\mathbb{C})$ which are covariant under conjugation by unitary symplectic matrices $S$, and (2) $d\otimes d$ bipartite states which are invariant under $S\otimes S$ or $S\otimes \overline{S}$ actions, each parametrized by two real variables. We provide a complete characterization of all $k$-positivity and decomposability conditions for these maps and explicitly compute the Schmidt numbers for the corresponding bipartite states. In particular, our analysis yields a broad class of PPT states with Schmidt number $d/2$ and the first explicit constructions of (optimal) $k$-positive indecomposable linear maps for arbitrary $k=1,\ldots, d/2-1$, achieving the best-known bounds. Overall, our results offer a natural and analytically tractable framework in which both strong forms of positive indecomposability and high degrees of PPT entanglement can be studied systematically.
  We present two further applications of symplectic group symmetry. First, we show that the PPT-squared conjecture holds within the class of PPT linear maps that are either symplectic-covariant or conjugate-symplectic-covariant. Second, we resolve a conjecture of Pal and Vertesi concerning the optimal lower bound of the Sindici-Piani semidefinite program for PPT entanglement.

Abstract: We present a finite schematic axiomatisation of quantum circuits over d-level systems (qudits), uniform in every finite dimension d >= 2. For each d we define a PROP equipped with a family of control functors, treating control as a primitive categorical constructor. Using a translation between qudit circuits and the LOPP calculus for linear optics based on d-ary Gray codes, we obtain for each d a finite set of local axiom schemata that is sound and complete for unitary d-level circuits: two circuits denote the same unitary if and only if they are inter-derivable using axioms involving at most three wires. The generators are compatible with standard universal qudit gate families, yielding a sound equational basis for circuit rewriting and optimisation-by-rewriting. Conceptually, this extends the qubit circuit completeness results of Clément et al.\ to arbitrary finite dimension, and instantiates the control-as-constructor approach of Delorme and Perdrix in this setting, while keeping the axiom shapes uniform in d.

Abstract: Equational reasoning is central to quantum circuit optimisation and verification: one replaces subcircuits by provably equivalent ones using a fixed set of rewrite rules viewed as equations. We study such reasoning through finite equational theories, presenting restricted quantum gate fragments as symmetric monoidal categories (PROPs), where wire permutations are treated as structural and separated cleanly from fragment-specific gate axioms. For six widely used near-Clifford fragments: qubit Clifford, real Clifford, Clifford+T (up to two qubits), Clifford+CS (up to three qubits) and CNOT-dihedral, we transfer the completeness results of prior work into our PROP framework. Beyond completeness, we address minimality (axiom independence). Using uniform separating interpretations into simple semantic targets, we prove minimality for several fragments (including all arities for qubit Clifford, real Clifford, and CNOT-dihedral), and bounded minimality for the remaining cases. Overall, our presentations significantly reduce rule counts compared to prior work and provide a reusable categorical framework for constructing complete and often minimal rewrite systems for quantum circuit fragments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to understand and characterize quantum statistical effects in linear optical systems, with potential applications in quantum computing and quantum optics.

Method: The authors derive the quantum multinomial distribution by considering identical photons undergoing linear optical transformations, incorporating interference effects using amplitude summations. They employ quantum mechanical principles without relying on Hilbert space formalism.

Result: The study reveals quantum departures from classical statistics, particularly through higher-order cumulants and cross-mode covariances. For example, higher-order moments exhibit quantum interference effects such as negative excess kurtosis. These quantum features can be used for verifying boson sampling without computing permanents.

Conclusion: The quantum multinomial distribution presented in the paper provides a new framework for modeling photon statistics in interferometers. It highlights quantum interference effects and offers potential applications in quantum computing verification.

Abstract: This paper presents a quantum generalization of the multinomial distribution for the transition probabilities of $m$ identical photons in a $k$-port linear optical interferometer: two multinomial coefficients (one for the input configuration, one for the output) times the squared modulus of a coherent sum over routing matrices, weighted by the multivariate hypergeometric distribution; no Hilbert space formalism is needed to state or evaluate it. The classical multinomial is recovered when all photons enter through a single port, the coherent sum degenerating to a single term with no interference; the quantum family is not a generalization in the Askey sense but a parallel family that departs from classical statistics through the coherence of the amplitude summation. The $r$-th factorial moment carries a squared multinomial coefficient in place of the classical single one, the extra factor arising from the two copies of the amplitude expansion whose indices the Fock state forces to agree; for the beam splitter, the third cumulant is invariant under bosonic interference and the quantum departure first appears in the fourth cumulant as negative excess kurtosis; for multiport interferometers, however, three-body interference breaks this invariance and the departure enters already at the third cumulant. Cross-mode covariances involve the phases of the scattering matrix through coherence terms that strengthen output anti-correlations beyond the classical value; together with the squared-coefficient signature in the single-mode moments, these provide low-order statistical witnesses for boson sampling verification without requiring the full permanent computation.

Conclusion: 引力是一种将量子相干性转化为纠缠的渠道。

Abstract: In recent years, the quantum nature of gravity has attracted significant attention as one of the most important problems in modern physics. Here, we analyze the mechanism of gravitationally-induced entanglement from the perspective of quantum resource theory. Building on the framework of Bose et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 240401 (2017)], we show that the gravitational interaction acts as a unitary channel, redistributing quantum resources between two spatially superposed masses. Specifically, we demonstrate that the resulting bipartite entanglement originates from the coherent conversion of local quantum coherence -- initially present in each subsystem -- into shared non-local correlations. We derive exact, analytical complementarity relations quantifying this conversion, link the decay of local coherence directly to the growth of entanglement, and support these findings with numerical simulations. Our results clarify the underlying mechanism and establish gravity as a coherence-to-entanglement conversion channel, offering a refined interpretive basis for forthcoming experimental tests. Crucially, we show that initial coherence is a necessary condition for entanglement generation and that its degree bounds the maximum achievable entanglement, with maximal entanglement requiring initial maximal coherence.

Abstract: The quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) provides a geometric representation, within the Bloch picture, of all possible states to which one qubit can be steered through measurements performed on another correlated qubit. However, in most realistic settings, quantum systems are inevitably coupled to their surrounding environment, resulting in decoherence and the consequent degradation of the QSE. Here, by investigating how local dissipative environments coupled separately to each qubit affect the steering properties geometrized by the QSE within an exact non-Markovian framework, we find that the geometry of each party's QSE is closely tied to whether a bound state forms in the energy spectrum of the total qubit-environment system. We systematically examine the characteristics of QSEs under three distinct scenarios: two-sided bound states, one-sided bound states, and no bound state, revealing a diverse range of steering types. Our work establishes quantum reservoir engineering as a tunable strategy for protecting and controlling quantum steering in open systems, offering a practical pathway toward robust steering-based quantum technologies.

*Carsten Blank,Israel F. Araujo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new quantum state preparation method called Tucker Iterative Quantum State Preparation (Q-Tucker), which optimizes shallow, deterministic quantum circuits by leveraging the Tucker decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficient quantum state preparation, particularly important for quantum machine learning where classical data must be encoded quickly. It highlights the limitations of existing amplitude encoding techniques and introduces a novel approach to overcome these challenges.

Method: The method proposed in the paper is based on the Tucker decomposition, which allows the decomposition of a tensor into a core tensor and mode-specific operators. This approach enables the construction of shallow quantum circuits by breaking down the target quantum states into more manageable components, facilitating efficient circuit construction.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the Q-Tucker method can construct deterministic and shallow quantum circuits for quantum state preparation, which are more efficient than existing methods that rely on recursive bipartitions or tensor decompositions leading to deep circuits. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional techniques in both circuit depth and construction complexity.

Conclusion: Q-Tucker offers a promising solution for efficient quantum state preparation, significantly reducing the depth of quantum circuits and providing a clear pathway for practical implementations in quantum computing applications such as machine learning and data processing.

Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a fundamental component of quantum algorithms, particularly in quantum machine learning and data processing, where classical data must be encoded efficiently into quantum states. Existing amplitude encoding techniques often rely on recursive bipartitions or tensor decompositions, which either lead to deep circuits or lack practical guidance for circuit construction. In this work, we introduce Tucker Iterative Quantum State Preparation (Q-Tucker), a novel method that adaptively constructs shallow, deterministic quantum circuits by exploiting the global entanglement structure of target states. Building upon the Tucker decomposition, our method factors the target quantum state into a core tensor and mode-specific operators, enabling direct decompositions across multiple subsystems.

Abstract: The dissipative phase transitions in the open transverse and longitudinal Dicke-Ising model (DIM), which incorporates nearest-neighbor Ising-type spin interactions into the Dicke framework, are investigated within a mean-field approach and further validated by detailed stability analysis. While the dissipative phase diagram of the transverse DIM is only slightly shifted upward compared with its ground-state counterpart, dissipation in the longitudinal DIM stabilizes bistable nonequilibrium steady states and induces first-order phase transitions that are absent in the ground-state phase diagram. This bistable phase is characterized by the coexistence of superradiant and antiferromagnetic orders, and it converts a ground-state triple point into a tetracritical point, at which the boundaries of the first- and second-order transitions intersect. Our results reveal that the interplay among spin interactions, light-matter coupling, and dissipation supports a diverse set of nonequilibrium phase transitions and provides broad tunability of the phase diagram. These findings offer a theoretical foundation for exploring nonequilibrium physics in realistic open solid-state quantum systems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic reconstruction of quantum dynamics based on inference over action space. The fundamental object is a density of action states encoding the multiplicity of dynamical alternatives between configurations. Maximum-entropy inference introduces a finite resolution scale in action, implying that sufficiently close action contributions are operationally indistinguishable. We show that this indistinguishability, together with probability normalization and action additivity, selects complex amplitudes and unitary evolution as the minimal continuous representation compatible with action additivity, probability normalization, and inference under finite resolution. Quantum interference and unitarity therefore emerge as consequences of these assumptions rather than independent postulates. From the resulting propagator, the Lagrangian, Hilbert-space structure, and Schrödinger equation follow as derived consequences. In the infinitesimal-time limit, action differences universally fall below the resolution scale, making coherent summation the minimal consistent description at every step. The numerical value of the action scale is fixed empirically and identified with $\hbar$.

Conclusion: 丙二烯醇二甲醇分子阵列成为模拟手性量子磁性的理想平台，首次从分子对称性角度解释复杂拓扑相。

Abstract: We propose a robust platform for simulating chiral quantum magnetism using linear arrays of trapped asymmetric top molecules, specifically 1,2-propanediol ($\mathrm{C_{3}H_{8}O_{2}}$). By mapping the Stark-dressed rotational states onto an effective spin-$1/2$ subspace, we rigorously derive a generalized $XXZ$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian governing the underlying many-body dynamics. Unlike standard solid-state models where the topological Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) is introduced phenomenologically, we demonstrate that DMI emerges \textit{ab initio} from the molecular stereochemistry. Specifically, the interference between the transition dipole moments of heterochiral enantiomer pairs (L-R), which breaks inversion symmetry, generates a tunable DMI that stabilizes a Chiral Luttinger Liquid phase. Through a comprehensive phase-diagram analysis, we identify an optimal experimental regime characterized by intermolecular separations of \( r \approx 1.5~\mathrm{nm} \) and intermediate electric-field strengths \( d\varepsilon/B \approx 2.5 \). In this window, the system is protected from trivial field-polarized phases and exhibits a robust gapless spin-spiral texture. Our results establish 1,2-propanediol arrays as a versatile quantum simulator, providing a direct microscopic link between molecular chirality and topological many-body phases.

Abstract: Recent developments in the field of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have shifted the prerequisites for trainability for many barren plateau-free models onto the data encoding state fed into a classically trainable unitary. By strengthening proofs relating to small-angle initialisation, we provide a full circuit model which does not suffer from barren plateaus and is robust against current classical simulation techniques, specifically tensor network contraction and Pauli propagation. We propose this as a quantum generative model amenable towards NISQ devices and quantum-classical hybrid models, raising new questions in the debate regarding usefulness of VQCs.

Abstract: The global availability of high-intensity neutron sources is restricted by the prohibitive costs of spallation facilities and the decommissioning of aging research reactors, while compact accelerator-driven sources (CANS) are fundamentally limited by target power density and thermal-mechanical stress. Here, we introduce SYNERGY (SYnchrotron-driven NEutron source for Research, energy Generation and therapY), a paradigm-shifting architecture that overcomes these bottlenecks by decoupling charged-particle acceleration from neutron production. By utilizing a storage ring to drive external photoneutron targets via synchrotron radiation, this topological separation ensures targets interact exclusively with a continuous-wave (CW) photon beam, minimizing thermo-mechanical shocks and enabling beam powers exceeding 200 kW per beamline. Through a systematic parametric analysis cross-validated using OpenMC, MCNPX, and FLUKA, we demonstrate single-beamline neutron production rates from $2.8\times10^{14}$ n/s to $1.3\times10^{15}$ n/s. With an inherent multi-beamline capacity feeding up to 50 independent stations, the total facility intensity exceeds $6.0\times10^{16}$ n/s. By bridging the gap between laboratory and national-scale infrastructure, SYNERGY provides a high-intensity, multi-user platform for subcritical systems, medical isotope production, and boron neutron capture therapy.

Abstract: Molecular polaritons, hybrid light-matter states formed from the strong coupling of molecular transitions and discrete photonic modes, are a compelling platform for optical control of chemical reactivity. Despite the origins of the field of polaritonics in atomic gases, strong coupling of molecular gases remains underexplored. The pristine, solvent-free gas-phase environment may prove ideal for gaining mechanistic understanding of molecular behavior under strong light-matter coupling. In this work, we achieve electronic strong coupling of the B-X, $ν_1$ = 0$\rightarrow$32, J = 53$\rightarrow$52 and B-X, $ν_1$ = 0$\rightarrow$34, J = 103$\rightarrow$102 rovibronic transitions of gas-phase iodine (I$_2$) lying near 532.2 nm. We access a range of coupling strengths and detuning conditions with fine control over molecular number density and cavity length stabilization. This effort represents the first demonstration of electronic polaritons in a molecular gas and opens a new platform for polariton photochemistry and photophysics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding molecular response properties, such as polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities, in various environments is crucial for advancing material science, drug design, and environmental chemistry. Efficient computational methods are essential for addressing the complexity of quantum systems in solution environments.

Method: The protocol extends multilevel density functional theory (MLDFT) to response theory by solving coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham (CPKS) equations for the MLDFT Hamiltonian. It couples an additional polarizable molecular mechanics layer based on the fluctuating-charge (FQ) force field to account for long-range interactions.

The results align with experimental data, confirming the method's accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a computationally efficient yet accurate framework for studying solute-solvent interactions, enabling deeper insights into the roles of electrostatics, polarization, and quantum confinement.

Abstract: We present a general computational protocol for the evaluation of extensive molecular response properties in complex environments within a polarizable quantum embedding framework. The approach extends multilevel density functional theory (MLDFT) to response theory by formulating the coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham (CPKS) equations for the MLDFT Hamiltonian. The method is further coupled to an additional polarizable molecular mechanics layer based on the fluctuating-charge (FQ) force field, which allows an accurate yet computationally efficient description of long-range interactions. We apply this new protocol to compute static and frequency-dependent linear polarizabilities and first hyperpolarizabilities of para-nitroaniline (PNA) in 1,4-dioxane and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) in aqueous solution. The framework enables physicochemical insight into solute-solvent interactions by disentangling the competing roles of electrostatics, mutual polarization, and quantum confinement (Pauli repulsion). The results match available experiments, demonstrating the reliability and robustness of the proposed approach and providing a viable route for response properties within quantum embedding methods.

Abstract: In enzymatic recycling or biodegradation of semi-crystalline plastic waste, crystalline spherulites embedded into an amorphous matrix hinder and slow down depolymerisation. When the enzymatic depolymerisation temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature, these spherulites tend to grow. The depolymerisation process is thus controlled by a competition between erosion of the amorphous matrix from the particle surface and the growth of recalcitrant spherulites within the particle bulk and at its surface. We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity.

Abstract: We report the observation of charge-exchange collisions between trapped calcium monohydride molecular ions ($^{40}$CaH$^+$) and ultracold potassium atoms ($^{39}$K) in a hybrid ion-atom trap. The measured charge-exchange rate coefficient is significantly suppressed relative to the Langevin rate constant for the system. We use quantum-chemical calculations to model the (CaH-K)$^+$ system in the ground and excited electronic states and to identify possible charge-exchange mechanisms. Our calculations do not fully explain the measured rate, highlighting the need for a full-dimensional quantum treatment that includes vibrational motion and intermediate complex formation. Our work demonstrates that cold hybrid ion-atom platforms with molecular ions enable access to richer chemical complexity and collisional dynamics inaccessible in purely atomic systems.

Abstract: High precision portable and deployable frequency standards are required for modern navigation and communication technologies. Optical frequency standards are attractive for their improved stability over their microwave counterparts; however, increased complexities have anchored them in the laboratory. Sacrificing sensitivity of the most stable optical clocks has led to the recent development of deployable and portable optical frequency standards, leveraging hot atomic or molecular vapor. The short term limit for a majority of previous reports on two-photon rubidium standards is either the shot-noise or intermodulation limit hindering the one second fractional frequency stability to around $1\times10^{-13}/\sqrtτ$. The answer for the shot-noise limit is to increase optical power and collected fluorescence, while the intermodulation limit solution requires improvements in laser linewidth, stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) lasers are known to reduce frequency noise, suppressing noise of the pump laser at high ofset frequencies. We investigate an optical frequency standard based on the two-photon transition in $^{87}$Rb probed with a narrow linewidth photonic integrated circuit SBS laser with a quality factor over 130 million and instantaneous linewidth $<$ 10 Hz. The use of a narrow linewidth clock laser coupled with operating at higher optical intensities yields clock instabilities of $2\times10^{-14}$ at one second, currently the best reported short-term stability for a two-photon rubidium optical frequency standard.

Abstract: Dysprosium (Dy) is the most magnetic element on the periodic table, making it excellent for studying dipolar atom-atom interactions. We report on a simple Dy MOT that captures atoms directly from the thermal beam using a single diode-laser system to generate the light. Additionally, the atoms are magnetically confined by the quadrupole magnetic field that also facilitates the MOT. The MOT loading time is $τ_\text{b} = 26~\text{ms}$. Atoms can decay to a dark state that is magnetically trapped. The time constant for loading into this magnetic trap is $τ_\text{d} = 410~\text{ms}$. The total magnetically trapped population is $1.14\times10^{5}$ atoms, with $85\%$ residing in the dark states. The magnetically trapped atoms have a temperature of $28~μ\text{K}$, significantly below the Doppler limit. This population fulfills the requirements for a range of future experiments.

A recently reported $9σ$ theory-experiment discrepancy in the ionization energy of metastable helium has motivated the hypothesis of a new boson mediating exotic electron-electron interactions. Using a model-independent sign-consistency analysis of the induced energy shifts, we show that the sign requirement alone excludes vector-vector and pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar interactions as possible explanations of the anomaly. Incorporating existing constraints together with improved limits obtained here further excludes axial-vector scenarios. Within the single-boson framework considered in this work, only a narrowly constrained scalar-mediated interaction remains viable. The remaining parameter space could be probed, for example, by modest improvements in the determination of the electron gyromagnetic ratio.

Abstract: How many canonical degrees of freedom does a quantum field theory actually use during its Hamiltonian evolution? For a UV/IR-regularised classical scalar field, we address this question directly at the level of phase-space dynamics by identifying the minimal symplectic dimension required to reproduce a single trajectory by an autonomous Hamiltonian system. Using symplectic model order reduction as a structure-preserving diagnostic, we show that for the free scalar field this minimal dimension is controlled not by the volume-extensive number of discretised field variables, but by the much smaller number of distinct normal-mode frequencies below the ultraviolet cutoff. In flat space, this leads to an area-type scaling with the size of the region, up to slowly varying corrections. On geodesic balls in maximally symmetric curved spaces, positive curvature induces mild super-area growth, while negative curvature suppresses the scaling, with the flat result recovered smoothly in the small-curvature limit. Numerical experiments further indicate that this behaviour persists in weakly interacting $λφ^4$ theory over quasi-integrable time scales. Beyond counting, the reduced dynamics exhibits a distinctive internal structure: it decomposes into independent oscillator blocks, while linear combinations of these blocks generate a larger family of apparent field modes whose Poisson brackets are governed by a projector rather than the identity. This reveals a purely classical and dynamical mechanism by which overlapping degrees of freedom arise, without modifying canonical structures by hand. Our results provide a controlled field-theoretic setting in which area-type scaling and overlap phenomena can be studied prior to quantisation, helping to identify which aspects of such structures--often discussed in holographic contexts--can already arise from classical Hamiltonian dynamics.

Conclusion: 广义对称性和异常为QFT的RG流动和IR相态提供了强大的新约束，扩展了对称性在量子场论中的应用。

Abstract: RG flows and IR phases of QFTs can be constrained by generalized symmetries and their anomalies. Broken symmetries act on the space of coupling constants of families of theories, and can also have IR-constraining family anomalies. We generalize family anomaly considerations to cases of broken generalized/categorical symmetries, including higher-group and non-invertible symmetries. We consider the anomaly inflow and SymTFTs of such generalized families of QFTs, and their implications for RG flows and constraints on the IR phases. As examples, we apply family anomalies to study the IR phases of $4d$ QCD-like theories deformed by irrelevant, multi-fermion interactions.

Abstract: A flat connection on a Riemann surface with values in an infinite dimensional Lie algebra provides a systematic and effective tool for generating an infinite family of polylogarithms via iterated integrals. The recent literature offers different types of connections, in one or several variables, on compact Riemann surfaces with or without punctures, and in the meromorphic or single-valued categories. In this work, we show that the flatness conditions for the single-valued and modular DHS connection in multiple variables, which was introduced in the companion paper arXiv:2602.01461, are equivalent to the union of all the interchange and Fay identities among DHS integration kernels that were proven in arXiv:2407.11476. Based on the same combinatorial techniques, the flatness conditions on the multivariable Enriquez connection is shown to imply the union of all the interchange and Fay identities for Enriquez kernels.

Conclusion: 物理解射矩阵至此被完整刻画，具有普适性与适用性。

Abstract: We derive an integrable reflection matrix for the scattering of excitations from a boundary with a degree of freedom when the reflection process preserves an $SU(1|2)$ symmetry. As this residual symmetry is not sufficient to fully determine the reflection matrix, we use the boundary remnant of the Yangian symmetry invariance and obtain a family of integrable solutions. A concrete realization of this setup is found when studying insertions in the 1/2 BPS Wilson loop in ABJM theory. The boundary degree of freedom appears as a boundary bound state due to poles in the dressing phase of the reflection matrix. We also compare our results with those obtained from the boundary bound state bootstrap procedure. The ABJM Wilson loop example enables us to perform perturbative verifications of our results.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first systematic investigation of renormalization group properties of mass dimension one fermions described by ELKO spinors. By construction, ELKOs must be neutral under any Standard Model charge, therefore, providing a natural candidate for dark matter. We consider two versions of scalar-ELKO systems: the first characterized by a derivative Yukawa-like interaction, while the second involves ELKO four-fermion interactions as well as a scalar-ELKO portal. We also considered a system composed of ELKOs interacting with an Abelian gauge field via Pauli-like term. In all cases, we identified the minimal set of interactions that are required by a consistent renormalization group flow, and we discussed the possibility of constructing UV-complete trajectories based on asymptotic freedom. We used the functional renormalization group as a method of investigation.

### [71] [Analytical methods in Quantum Field Theories: from loop integrals to defect correlators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09226)
*Daniele Artico*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper extends techniques at weak coupling by studying Feynman integrals and supersymmetry's role in reducing the number of integrals needed to compute correlators involving a line defect. It explores two main parts: deriving linear relations among integrals using projective geometry and analyzing a defect CFT in \\) \mathcal{N}=4 \\) super Yang-Mills theory. The second part involves calculating correlation functions up to next-to-next-to-leading order, identifying integrals that encapsulate all perturbative information as either rational functions or Goncharov polylogarithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in advancing our understanding of weak coupling techniques, particularly in the context of Feynman integrals and their behavior in the presence of a line defect. By leveraging super symmetry and algebraic structures, the work aims to simplify calculations in correlation functions, which are fundamental in quantum field theory. This research is relevant to physicists working on gauge theories, defect CFTs, and high-energy physics phenomenology.

Method: The authors first derive linear relations among Feynman integrals by examining their properties as projective forms. These relations are then applied to one- and multi-loop examples, uncovering connections to algebraic polynomial ideals. The paper also studies a defect CFT using bulk-defect-defect and multipoint correlation functions, employing perturbative expansion techniques to calculate terms up to next-to-next-to-leading order. The methods involve advanced algebraic geometry and perturbative QFT techniques, utilizing Feynman parametrization and integration methods specific to defect theories.

Result: The study identifies and classifies integrals that contain all the perturbative information necessary for computing correlators in the defect CFT, showing that these integrals reduce to rational functions or Goncharov polylogarithms. Key findings include the derivation of linear relations among Feynman integrals, which significantly simplify the computation of correlators and reveal deeper algebraic structures in the problem. The authors also provide explicit calculations of correlation functions up to next-to-next-to-leading order, demonstrating the effectiveness of their methods in handling complex Feynman integrals in the presence of defects.

Conclusion: This paper contributes to the development of weak coupling techniques in quantum field theory, particularly in the context of line defects and their impact on correlators. By uncovering linear relations among integrals and identifying simplified forms, the research enhances our ability to compute and understand physical quantities in defect CFTs, providing valuable tools for further studies in this area.

Abstract: This thesis expands the available techniques at weak coupling by investigating the linear space of Feynman integrals and the role that (super)symmetry plays in reducing the number of integrals necessary to calculate correlators in the presence of a one-dimensional extended operator - the line defect. In the first part, linear relations among Feynman parametrized integrals are derived from their properties as projective forms; these relations are then tested on one- and multi-loop examples, and their connection to the algebra of polynomial ideals is uncovered. In the second part, made of two chapters, the defect CFT formed by the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory in the presence of a Maldacena-Wilson line is studied through bulk-defect-defect and multipoint correlation functions up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the perturbative expansion at weak coupling. The investigations into this defect CFT lead to the identification of classes of integrals containing all the perturbative information necessary to compute the correlators, which turn out to be either rational functions or Goncharov polylogarithms.

Abstract: We study correlation functions with fractional-mode excitations of the R-symmetry currents in D1-D5 CFT. We show how fractional-mode excitations lift to the covering surface associated with correlation functions as a specific sum of integer-mode excitations, with coefficients that can be determined exactly from the covering map in terms of Bell polynomials. We consider the four-point functions of fractional excitations of two chiral/anti-chiral NS fields, Ramond ground states and the twist-two scalar modulus deformation operator that drives the CFT away from the free point. We derive explicit formulas for classes of these functions with twist structures $(n)$-$(2)$-$(2)$-$(n)$ and $(n_1)(n_2)$-$(2)$-$(2)$-$(n_1)(n_2)$, the latter involving double-cycle fields. The final answer for the four-point functions always depends only on the lift of the base-space cross-ratio. We discuss how this relates to Hurwitz blocks associated with different conjugacy classes of permutations, the corresponding OPE channels and fusion rules.

Abstract: We propose a first-order geometric Lagrangian for four-dimensional conformal gravity within the Cartan formulation, which yields, dynamically, the standard constraints on the fields, expected for conformal gravity. Upon imposing the dynamical constraints, together with the request of conformal invariance of the off-shell Lagrangian, the theory reduces to the standard expression for conformal gravity, in terms of quadratic curvature invariants. Our results clarify the geometric status of conformal gravity as a gauge theory and open the way to a similar dynamical implementation of the constraints in higher dimensions and supersymmetric extensions.

Abstract: The Lee-Yang phase transition theory applied in the anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole has inspired the exploration of complex phase diagram and supercritical phenomena in black hole thermodynamics. In this study, we extend the approach to the four dimensional Born-Infeld AdS black hole. This system exhibits a rich phase structure, including reentrant phase transitions, due to the modulation of the Born-Infeld nonlinear parameter. Through the analysis by Lee-Yang zeros, we obtained the complex phase diagram of the Born-Infeld AdS black hole and derived the supercritical crossover line -- Widom line. It strictly originates from the first-order stable critical point. The results indicate that Born-Infeld nonlinear effects significantly alter the types and characteristics of phase transition in critical region, while do not disrupt the uniqueness of the Widom line in supercritical region. Our study uncovers a universal simplified feature of the thermodynamic behavior of nonlinear gravitational systems in supercritical region. It also deepens our understanding of the fundamental connection between critical phenomena and continuous phase transitions in the extended phase space of black holes.

Abstract: In this article, we further explore the construction and computation of expectation values for Wilson loops in higher-rank 5d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{C}_2 \times S_1$, by explicitly computing the Wilson loops via Chern-character insertion and qq-characters, including cases with the exceptional gauge group $G_2$. In particular, we propose a systematic way to write down the general blowup equations for Wilson loops by using the constraints from the one-form symmetry and low-instanton data from the instanton partition function. In addition, for one-instanton contributions in a large family of Wilson loop representations, we observe that they admit a $q_1q_2$-expansion, similar to the Hilbert-series structure of instanton partitions in pure gauge theories.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the $(1+1)$-dimensional Dirac oscillator within a class of doubly special relativity (DSR) models generated by linear-fractional (projective) transformations on momentum space that preserve both the invariant speed of light and a high-energy observer-independent scale $\Ep$. Starting from the associated deformed Casimir invariants, we construct the coordinate-space Dirac equations for three inequivalent choices of the deformation vector (time-like, space-like, and light-like). For the time-like and light-like realizations the deformation induces momentum-dependent effective mass operators, which makes the coordinate-space formulation sensitive to operator ordering. To retain locality and obtain solvable second-order equations we adopt a reverted-product ordering prescription. Closed-form relativistic energy spectra and eigenfunctions are obtained in all three geometries, and the standard Dirac-oscillator results are recovered smoothly in the limit $\Ep\to\infty$. Finally, we derive the nonrelativistic expansion of the positive-energy branch and show that the deformation geometry controls the leading rest-energy shift and the renormalization of the oscillator level spacing.

Abstract: We combine spectral- and split representations to factorize multi-loop momentum space diagrams, in the Schwinger-Keldysh formulation for cosmological correlators, with massive scalars in the loop. This allows us to extend the resummation of loop contributions from flat to de Sitter space. Furthermore, in our split representation the signal part of the correlators can be identified directly on the integrand level from the spectral function. We apply this to describe the non-perturbative flow of the EFT background and the cosmological collider signals in a large-N model.

Abstract: In this paper discrete equations are derived from Bäcklund transformations of the fifth Painlevé equation, including a new discrete equation which has ternary symmetry. There are two classes of rational solutions of the fifth Painlevé equation, one expressed in terms of the generalised Laguerre polynomials and the other in terms of the generalised Umemura polynomials, both of which can be expressed as Wronskians of Laguerre polynomials. Hierarchies of rational solutions of the discrete equations are derived in terms of the generalised Laguerre and generalised Umemura polynomials. It is known that there is nonuniqueness of some rational solutions of the fifth Painlevé equation. Pairs of nonunique rational solutions are used to derive distinct hierarchies of rational solutions which satisfy the same discrete equation.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: LISA将观察非常大的黑洞双星（MBHBs），但 negligence of higher-order modes will induce significant systematic errors, especially for systems with non-aligned spins. We propose an improved likelihood optimization scheme to account for these errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of massive black hole binaries by LISA will greatly advance our understanding of black hole mergers, their spins, and the surrounding environments. Accurate parameter estimation is crucial but challenging due to higher-order mode effects.

Method: We extend Yi et al.'s work to include systems with nonzero aligned progenitor spins and total masses up to $10^8m{M_	ext{sun}}$. Analytical expressions are derived to examine the impact of neglected higher-order modes on parameter estimation.

Result: For very massive MBHBs, the $(m{	ext{l}}, |m{m}|) = (2, 2)$ modes are no longer dominant for higher-order modes. The magnitude of systematic bias varies significantly with progenitor spins. Heaviest MBHB signals can have severe mis-inference in sky localization parameters. We propose an improved likelihood optimization scheme to reduce these systematic errors.

Conclusion: Neglection of higher-order mode effects can significantly bias parameter estimation for LISA observations of very massive black hole binaries. Our improved method provides a computationally efficient way to account for these effects.

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with astoundingly high signal-to-noise ratio, leaving parameter estimation with these signals susceptible to seemingly small waveform errors. Of particular concern for MBHBs are errors due to neglected higher-order modes. We extend Yi et al. [arXiv:2502.12237] to examine errors due to neglected higher-order modes for MBHBs with nonzero (aligned) progenitor spins and total mass up to $10^8\,M_\odot$. For these very massive systems, there can be regions of parameter space in which the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,\,2)$ modes are no longer dominant with respect to higher-order ones. We find that the extent of systematic bias can change significantly when varying the progenitor spins of the binary. We also find that for the heaviest, and therefore shortest, MBHB signals, slight systematic errors can cause severe mis-inference of the sky localization parameters. We propose an improved likelihood optimization scheme with respect to previous work as a way to predict these effects in a computationally efficient manner.

### [81] [Optical Signatures of a Schwarzschild Black Hole in a Dehnen-Type Dark Matter Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09168)
*Javokhir Sharipov,Jonibek Khasanov,Pankaj Sheoran,Sanjar Shaymatov,Bobomurat Ahmedov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates optical effects near a Schwarzschild-like black hole with a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. The authors derive the photon sphere radius and the deflection angle in both weak and strong field regimes using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and ray-tracing methods. They also compute the black hole shadow and gravitational lensing in a plasma medium and derive expressions for the deflection angle in the presence of a plasma. The results highlight how DM halo properties and plasma characteristics affect lensing signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of black hole lensing and its associated optical effects is important for understanding the behavior of light in strong gravitational fields, particularly in the presence of dark matter halos and plasma environments. This paper builds on previous work by the authors and extends their analysis to include plasma effects.

Method: The authors use a combination of analytical methods, such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and numerical methods, including ray-tracing calculations, to study the deflection angle of light, the black hole shadow, and gravitational lensing in different regimes.

Result: The paper derives analytical expressions for the deflection angle in both weak and strong field regimes, as well as in the presence of a plasma medium. They also compute the black hole shadow and gravitational lensing signatures under plasma conditions. The authors find that the presence of dark matter halos and plasma significantly affects the lensing signatures, with the deflection angle and image magnification showing notable modifications.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DM halo properties and plasma characteristics jointly alter observable lensing signatures, providing a more comprehensive understanding of gravitational lensing in realistic astrophysical scenarios. The analytical and numerical results presented in the paper offer valuable tools for further studies in this field.

Abstract: In this paper, the optical effects that occur near a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) with a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter (DM) halo are explored. We first derive the photon sphere radius and obtain an analytical expression for the deflection angle in the weak-field regime by applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). For the strong-field regime, we perform ray-tracing calculations to examine the behavior of light trajectories and determine the corresponding number of orbits. We further compute the BH shadow and gravitational lensing in a plasma medium and provide constraints arising from the DM halo parameters. We also extend our analysis to weak gravitational lensing within plasma environments, considering both uniform and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) distributions. We find the analytical expressions for the deflection angle in the presence of plasma and examine the resulting effects on image magnification. The overall results highlight how DM halo properties and plasma characteristics jointly alter observable lensing signatures.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation and propagation of gravitational waves within a minimal gravitational SME (Standard Model Extension). Starting from the modified graviton dispersion relation derived in the linearized gravity sector, we analyze the polarization properties of gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless tensor sector. We then construct the retarded Green function associated with the Lorentz-violating wave operator, explicitly verifying the causal structure of the theory and identifying the modified propagation speeds of the tensorial modes. In addition, we study the source-induced emission of gravitational waves from a binary black-hole system. We show that the gravitational waveform preserves the standard quadrupolar amplitude and polarization structure, while Lorentz-violating effects enter exclusively through a modification of the retarded time. As a result, the spatial components of the metric perturbation $h_{ij}(t,r)$ acquire a phase shift determined by the SME coefficients. Finally, we estimate phenomenological bounds to the model under consideration.

Abstract: According to current theory a black hole has a nonzero temperature and thus radiates like any black body. This remarkable result was first shown by Hawking for a non-spinning black hole using general relativity to describe the black hole gravitational field and quantum field theory to describe the radiation. Since then the temperature of a spinning Kerr black hole has been calculated. There have also been many heuristic derivations for the temperature. In this work we derive the temperature of a Kerr spinning black hole using only classical general relativity and thermodynamics. It is very similar to Ref. 11 but is mathematically simpler and more self-contained. Our purpose is mainly pedagogical, to be more accessible to students and non-specialists with a knowledge of general relativity. We also call further attention to the expected explosive evaporation of small black holes, not yet observed, which would be an almost unique window into Planck scale physics. Finally, we discuss the idea that the cosmological dark matter, whose nature is currently unknown, may be composed of small primordial black hole remnants.

Abstract: Random tensor models can be used as combinatorial devices to generate Euclidean dynamical triangulations. A physical continuum limit of dynamical triangulations requires a suitable generalization of the double-scaling limit of random matrices. This limit corresponds to a fixed point of a pregeometric Renormalization Group flow in which the tensor size $N$ serves as the Renormalization Group scale. We search for corresponding fixed points in order-4 random tensor models associated to dynamical triangulations in 4 dimensions. In a $O(N)^{\otimes 4}$ symmetric setting, we discuss the resulting phase portrait as a function of the regulator parameters. We optimize our results, identifying parameter values for which the results are minimally sensitive to parameter changes. We find three fixed-point candidates: only one of them is real across the entire parameter range, but only has two relevant directions. This should be contrasted with the university class of the Reuter fixed point in continuum quantum gravity, very likely characterized by three relevant directions. We conclude that simple combinatorial models of Euclidean triangulations and the Reuter fixed point most likely lie in different universality classes.

Abstract: If our observable Universe is only a tiny region of a vastly larger and conformally older spacetime, then the usual formulations of the classical flatness and horizon problems of the Hot Big Bang can be reinterpreted as artifacts manifesting an observational selection effect; we occupy a small causal domain of a much larger causally-connected and possibly non-flat spacetime. A sufficiently large positive cosmological constant, $Λ$, sets the future asymptotic horizon scale of the observable Universe, $\sim$$Λ^{-1/2}$, thereby implying that the observable Universe may simply be a minute patch of a far larger pre-existing one, hereafter a Small Patch Hypothesis. Importantly, this observational bound is purely geometric; regardless of when the Universe is observed, the maximum accessible scale is finite and fixed by $Λ$, independent of inflationary dynamics, anthropic arguments, or assumptions about the global hosting spacetime. In this sense, inflation becomes one viable realization of the proposed Small Patch Hypothesis. Here, one particular non-inflationary alternative is considered for illustrative purposes in which a primordial spectrum grows logarithmically toward large scales, and in fact diverges at some finite $k_{c}$. If $k_{c}\ll Λ^{-1/2}$, then our local cosmic patch probes only the linear regime and appears exceptionally smooth. Over the comparatively narrow observable window, this power spectrum mimics a slightly red-tilted, inflation-like spectrum. Rather than introducing high-energy new fields, this perspective frames large-scale homogeneity, isotropy, Gaussianity, adiabaticity, and the observed thermodynamic Arrow of Time as possible consequences of restricted observational access to a much larger Universe in equilibrium, rather than signatures of a unique early-Universe mechanism.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic bound orbits and gravitational wave (GW) emission in the Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson (Schwarzschild-BR) spacetime-an exact electrovacuum solution describing a static black hole (BH) immersed in a uniform magnetic field. We explore how the background magnetic field qualitatively alters the BH's gravitational dynamics, affecting timelike geodesics such as the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then analyze periodic bound orbits using the frequency ratio ${ω_{\varphi}}/{ω_{r}}$, which characterizes the orbits by their azimuthal and radial motions. Based on the numerical kludge method we further compute the gravitational waveforms emitted from periodic orbits around a supermassive Schwarzschild-BR BH. We show that the background magnetic field significantly changes orbital frequencies, resonance conditions, zoom-whirl structures, and the resulting waveforms. Finally, we examine the frequency spectra in the mHz range and the detectability of these GW signals by computing the characteristic strain via a discrete Fourier transform on the time-domain waveforms, comparing the results with the sensitivity curves of space-based GW detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Our results show that intrinsically magnetic fields modify spacetime and leave observable imprints on extreme mass-ratio inspiral GWs, which may be tested by future observations.

### [87] [Constraints on Interacting Early Dark Energy from a Modified Temperature-Redshift Relation and CMB Acoustic Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09498)
*Y Bisabr*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Hubble tension by proposing an early dark energy model coupled to radiation during pre-recombination, which modifies the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature evolution by introducing energy exchange between the components. The coupling is interpreted in terms of effective photon non-conservation, and while it affects background evolution, it doesn’t introduce new degrees of freedom at the perturbation level. The primary observational impact is through a shift in the sound horizon at recombination, modifying the angular acoustic scale. Constraints from the Planck satellite limit the coupling strength, keeping deviations from standard CMB physics tightly bounded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the persistent issue known as the Hubble tension, which highlights a discrepancy in the determination of the Hubble constant at early and late cosmic times. This discrepancy motivates the exploration of extending the standard cosmological model to explain the observed anomalies in the Hubble constant measurements.

Method: The authors employ a theoretical framework where an early dark energy scalar field interacts with radiation before recombination. They derive the modified CMB temperature evolution by analyzing background equations and identify the interaction as effective photon non-conservation. They also perform a linear scalar perturbation analysis within the tight-coupling regime relevant for CMB acoustic physics. Their approach ensures that the interaction does not introduce new dynamical degrees of freedom at the perturbation level.

Result: Through interactions leading to a shift in the sound horizon at recombination, the model modifies the angular acoustic scale. Applying Planck constraints on the acoustic scale, the authors derive consistency bounds on the coupling strength, demonstrating that deviations from standard CMB behavior are constrained to a tight range.

Conclusion: The paper proposes an early dark energy model that modifies the CMB temperature evolution by introducing a coupling between pre-recombination radiation and dark energy. The interaction, interpreted as effective photon non-conservation, primarily affects background evolution without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom at the perturbation level. The model's main observational impact is the modification of the angular acoustic scale, which, when compared with Planck data, constrains the coupling strength, keeping deviations from standard cosmological predictions within acceptable limits.

Abstract: The Hubble tension, reflecting a persistent discrepancy between early- and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant, continues to motivate extensions of the standard cosmological model The Hubble tension motivates extensions of the standard cosmological model that modify pre-recombination physics. In this work we study an early dark energy scalar field coupled to radiation prior to recombination. The interaction leads to energy exchange between the two components and modifies the standard cosmic microwave background temperature redshift relation.
  We derive the modified temperature evolution from the background equations and interpret it in terms of effective photon non-conservation. We also study linear scalar perturbations in the tight-coupling regime relevant for cosmic microwave background acoustic physics. We show that the interaction affects the background evolution without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom at the perturbation level.
  The dominant observational effect arises through a shift in the sound horizon at recombination, which modifies the angular acoustic scale. Using the Planck constraint on the acoustic scale we obtain a consistency bound on the coupling strength and show that deviations from the standard temperature redshift relation are tightly constrained.

Abstract: We investigate a cosmic scenario using a new transition parameterization of the $Om(z)$ diagnostic, $Om(z) = \frac{z^l}{(1+z)^m}$, in the spatially flat Friedmann Lemaître Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework. Using observational datasets such as Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Pantheon Plus (PP), and SH0ES, we analyze the evolution of the $Om(z)$ function to probe deviations from the standard $Λ$CDM model and constrain free parameter space {$H_0$, l, m } using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with the emcee sampler. Our analysis reveals a clear transition in the slope of $Om(z)$ from negative to positive at transition redshift values $z_t \approx 1.41$, $0.65$, and $0.33$ for the OHD, OHD+PP, and OHD+PP$\&$SH0ES datasets, respectively. This behavior suggests a dynamical evolution of dark energy, indicating a transition from a quintessence-like phase to a phantom regime. From the combined OHD+PP$\&$SH0ES dataset, we obtain a best-fit value of the Hubble constant \( H_0 = 73.01 \pm 0.36 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}} \), which is consistent with the SH0ES calibration and supports the viability of our model. Additionally, our analysis indicates that the current age of the Universe is approximately $13 \sim 14$ Gyr from all available combinations of datasets, which is consistent with observational expectations. Further, we find that the deceleration-to-acceleration transition, which marks the beginning of cosmic acceleration, is inferred to occur within the redshift interval $z_t \in [0.5, 0.8]$, highlighting the emergence of dark energy as the dominant component in the Universe's recent expansion history. Our transition $Om(z)$ parameterization captured progressive cosmological changes and enabled seamless interpolation over cosmic epochs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by recent efforts to bridge between weak-field and strong-field descriptions of black-hole binary dynamics, we develop a resummation scheme for post-Minkowskian radiative observables in extreme-mass-ratio scattering, augmented with post-Newtonian terms. Specifically, we derive universal interpolation formulas for the total energy emitted in gravitational waves out to infinity and down the event horizon of the large black hole, valid to leading order in the small mass ratio. We test our formulas using numerical results from direct calculations in black hole perturbation theory. The central idea of our approach is to utilize as a strong-field diagnostic the known form of divergence in the radiated energy along geodesics near the parameter-space separatrix between scattering and plunge. The dominant, logarithmic term of this divergence can be expressed in terms of instantaneous energy fluxes calculated along the unstable circular geodesics that form the separatrix, fluxes that we obtain using interpolation of highly accurate numerical data. The same idea could be applied to bound-orbit radiative observables via either unbound-to-bound mapping or a direct resummation of bound-orbit post-Newtonian expressions.

Abstract: The parallel theory of relativity predicts conserved energy-momentum currents for an arbitrary metric, without invoking Killing symmetries. By treating the reference frame as an independent variational field and requiring it to carry no energy, the theory naturally unifies Einstein's two formulations of gravity and yields uniquely defined covariant charges. In isotropic and homogeneous cosmology, the canonical time direction selected by the reference frame coincides with the Kodama vector, and the associated Noether energy reproduces the Misner-Sharp mass.

Abstract: Accurate extraction of the complex dielectric constant in the terahertz (THz) band is essential for material characterization and non-destructive evaluation yet remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of electromagnetic inverse problems and the limited availability of reliable reference data. In this work, a field-material couple neural network (FMCNN) is proposed to retrieve the complex dielectric constant directly from THz measurements. The FMCNN consists of a field neural network and a material neural network that are strongly coupled through the frequency-domain Maxwell equations in the form of a Helmholtz equation, with the governing physics enforced by partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary condition constraints. This formulation enables prior-free and data-free inversion, requiring only measured test data as input. The extracted dielectric constants are validated by comparison with results from a one-dimensional normal-incidence model and the Drude-Lorentz model, showing good agreement over a broad frequency range, particularly above 0.2 THz. These results demonstrate that the FMCNN provides a physics-consistent and data-efficient approach for material parameter extraction in the THz band, offering an alternative to conventional model-based methods.

Abstract: The development of material acceleration platforms in battery research requires integrating complementary techniques and correlating heterogeneous experimental datasets. Here, this challenge is tackled in a large-scale multimodal program involving fifteen laboratories and facilities across Europe. Coordinated multi-site experiments are performed on state-of-the-art graphite / LiNiO2 Li-ion full cells to address two archetypal scientific questions: is the electrolyte composition impacting electrode properties, and how do electrode materials evolve when cells are cycled to their end-of-life? A fully standardized and centralized workflow is demonstrated, from sample production and delivery, to metadata and data handling, generating seventy-five concatenated datasets shared among all partners. Their integrated analysis shows that scientific conclusions depend critically on both the observable chosen to describe electrode properties, and the measurement technique employed. Individual experiments provide detailed information into specific aspects, such as crystal structures, redox activity, surface processes, morphology, etc., but can also function as binary diagnostic tool. Two-dimensional observable-technique patterns are introduced, in which each pixel encodes a yes, no or uncertain answer to a given scientific question. These patterns serve as multi-property metaviews, e.g. visual genotypes, enabling to classify material behavior and technique suitability according to predefined user demand and criteria, highlighting the interdependencies between measurement choices, extracted parameters and scientific interpretation. This multimodal workflow establishes a proof-of-concept for correlative analysis and underscores challenges toward fully integrated, automated and holistic approaches in energy material science.

Abstract: Thin-film self-assembly of three-dimensional (3D) microsystems presents a compelling route to integrate complex functionalities into ultracompact volumes, yet strategies for incorporating tunable ion-conducting elements remain limited. Here, we introduce a strain-induced self-assembly platform that transforms lithographically patterned multilayer thin films into functional 3D coaxial Swiss-roll microtubes with total active volumes below 1 uL. A key innovation is the monolithic integration of a chemically tunable polyimide proton-exchange membrane, enabling post-fabrication optimization of ionic transport. We further implement a dual-mode operational scheme that decouples microbial metabolism from electrochemical power generation, effectively eliminating biofouling and enhancing operational stability. This integrated bio-electronic microsystem achieves a volumetric power density of ca. 3.1 mW cm-3 within an ultra-compact footprint of 4.16 mm2. Our work establishes a scalable thin-film engineering approach to create tunable, 3D-bioelectronic power sources for autonomous microsystems.

Abstract: We present a machine-learning-driven inverse design framework for systematically engineering three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators that support modes with nonzero electromagnetic helicity. In contrast to heuristic approaches to cavity design, helicity maximisation is formulated as a boundary-shape optimisation problem, enabling systematic exploration of complex boundary-shape parameter spaces and the identification of high-helicity designs that are difficult to predict using heuristic design rules alone. We applied this framework to several cavity families composed of smooth, edge-free components, including globally twisted cavities with control-point-defined cross-sections realised in both linear and ring configurations, cavities defined by the intersection of orthogonal prisms, sphere-subtracted cylindrical cavities, and parametrised surface resonators. Two gradient-free optimisation strategies, a genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimisation, were independently employed to explore compact sets of design parameters for these geometries and to optimise a scaled-helicity figure of merit for the dominant helical mode, evaluated via finite-element eigenmode analysis. Robustness to manufacturing tolerances was quantified by applying Gaussian geometric perturbations to the optimised cavities and evaluating statistical robustness metrics that penalise sensitivity to geometric variation.

Abstract: Anisotropic van der Waals materials provide a powerful platform for nanoscale optoelectronics, enabling strong light$-$matter interaction and deep electromagnetic field confinement mediated by polaritons, hybrid light$-$matter excitations with unique dispersion properties. While polaritonic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures have been extensively explored in the mid-infrared frequency range, their behaviour at the visible frequencies remains largely unexplored, in part due to the lack of knowledge on natural materials supporting anisotropic and highly confined visible-range polaritons. In this context, MoOCl$_2$, an anisotropic van der Waals metal, is particularly interesting, since it supports hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (PPs) that enable directional propagation and subwavelength light compression. Here, we investigate the strategy for launching anisotropic PPs in MoOCl$_2$ in the visible frequency range using gold rod nanoantennas. The nanoantennas, placed on top of the MoOCl$_2$ crystal, excite in-plane anisotropic PP modes, effectively overcoming the momentum mismatch between waves in free-space and nanoscale PPs. We demonstrate a strong electromagnetic field confinement, angle-dependent absorption, and controlled anisotropic PP launching enabled by gold nanoantennas, highlighting the potential of MoOCl$_2$ as a compact platform for nanoscale waveguiding and optical signal processing. By providing a practical antenna-based strategy for exciting visible-range PPs, this work addresses the lack of compact elements for optical signal manipulation and opens new opportunities for optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals polaritonics.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of miniaturization in photonic integrated circuits by proposing the use of hyperbolic van der Waals crystals.

Method: The research involves theoretical modeling and analysis of the optical response of MoOCl2 in the telecom range.

Result: The study predicts the existence of hyperbolic polaritons in MoOCl2 operating within the telecom window and identifies potential applications in photonic components.

Conclusion: MoOCl2 holds significant potential for revolutionizing on-chip optoelectronics with its unique optical properties and applications in future photonic devices.

Abstract: On-chip optoelectronics is fundamental to modern telecommunication, yet the diffraction limit of light remains a major obstacle to the extreme miniaturization of photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Hyperbolic polaritons (HPs) $-$ hybrid light-matter excitations in materials with opposite-signed dielectric permittivity tensor components $-$ offer a solution through their ability to support deep sub-wavelength confinement and unique optical phenomena such as canalization and negative refraction. To date, however, the most widely studied hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) crystals, including hBN and $α$-MoO$_3$, operate mainly in the mid-infrared, leaving the telecommunication bands (1260$-$1675 nm) largely uncovered. Here, we predict HPs operating directly in the telecommunication window in the vdW crystal molybdenum oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Building on recent evidence that MoOCl$_2$ can support plasmon polaritons in the visible, we theoretically investigate its optical response at telecom wavelengths and identify the conditions under which strongly confined, canalized HPs modes emerge. Beyond establishing a telecom platform, we outline device-level opportunities enabled by these modes, including diffraction-free waveguides based on canalization, tunable polaritonic crystals, and high-efficiency spontaneous emission-enhancement platforms. These paradigms cover the essential pillars of on-chip information processing: emission, propagation, modulation and detection. Our results establish MoOCl$_2$ as a potentially transformative material that bridges physics of hyperbolic PPs with potential practical implementations, opening avenues for ultra-compact, high-density, and low-power photonic components.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interactions of STOV singularities is important for advancing optical manipulation and manipulation of light in various applications.

Method: The researchers studied a STOV with three phase singularities, observing vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning temporal dispersion. Experiments were conducted in both spatial and temporal dimensions using a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method.

Result: The study reveals that the interaction between vortices is due to the spatiotemporal attractive effect, which is related to the singularity distance. Additionally, the formation of filament and annihilation behaviors was observed by introducing an antivortex.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into the dynamics of STOV singularities within a single wave packet and opens up new possibilities for controlling and manipulating light in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

Abstract: Vortex dynamics are intriguing and challenging across multiple physics fields. In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom. However, the interaction mechanisms between multiple transverse orbital angular momentum singularities within a single wave packet remain elusive. This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time. These findings confirm the existence of interesting interactions between STOV singularities, deepen our understanding of photonics and open a new direction for investigating the complex dynamics of vortex singularities in the spatiotemporal domain.

Conclusion: 通过逆设计的双层衍射光栅模块，实现了 THz 光束的灵活轨迹调控。该方法为 THz 应用提供了一个紧凑且可扩展的光束调控平台，优于传统自加速光束在辐射近场 THz 通信中的应用前景。

Abstract: Curved electromagnetic beams at terahertz (THz) frequencies have recently emerged as a powerful example of wavefront engineering, with applications in imaging and high-capacity wireless communications. Unlike canonical self-accelerating solutions such as Airy beams, general curved-beam propagation enables arbitrary, application-specific trajectories that are not constrained by analytic beam families. Here, we demonstrate a passive and reconfigurable approach for generating trajectory-engineered THz curved beams using inverse-designed bilayer diffractive optical elements (DOEs). Two phase-only diffractive layers are optimized using gradient-based inverse design to produce predetermined curved propagation paths. Reconfiguration is achieved by a 180° rotation of the second layer, which modifies the effective phase profile of the cascaded structure without altering the incident wave or individual layer designs. The proposed system can produce distinct curved trajectories with controlled transverse displacement and beam confinement, as confirmed by scalar diffraction simulations and experimental measurements. Overall, this work establishes inverse-designed cascaded DOEs as a compact and scalable platform for reconfigurable trajectory control of THz beams, providing a flexible alternative to analytic self-accelerating beams for radiative near-field THz communications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of high-sensitivity chemical imaging techniques is crucial for understanding cellular processes and diagnosing diseases.

Method: HELP-CARS combines a high-energy, low-photodamage optical parametric amplifier with deep learning for denoising and background removal.

Result: The method achieves micromolar sensitivity, enabling imaging of 160 uM Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 and first observation of lipid droplet separation.

Conclusion: HELP-CARS microscopy provides a robust, ultrasensitive tool for vibrational imaging in biological research and diagnostics.

Abstract: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy offers label-free chemical imaging capabilities, but its performance is constrained by small Raman scattering cross-section, strong non-resonant background (NRB), and limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we introduce a high-energy, low-photodamage CARS (HELP-CARS) platform designed to overcome these physical limitations. By employing a 1-MHz non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) with extensive pulse chirping, HELP-CARS increases the coherent Raman excitation efficiency by ~300 times and improves the signal-to-nonresonant background ratio by 11 times, while inducing negligible damage during live cell imaging. Furthermore, to remove non-independent noise and physically entangled non-resonant background, we incorporate self-supervised deep-learning denoising and background removal based on the Kramers-Kronig relationship, yielding sensitivity improvement by an additional order of magnitude. Together, these advances provide a micromolar imaging sensitivity (160 uM for Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6) corresponding to 1000 molecules in the focal volume. Such high sensitivity enables high-fidelity chemical imaging in both fingerprint and silent windows. Hyperspectral HELP-CARS imaging of deuterated fatty acids allowed first observation of chemical separation with single lipid droplet. Together, HELP-CARS offers a powerful and generalizable approach for ultrasensitive and quantitative vibrational imaging of biological systems.

Motivation: 材料科学和光学领域中的一个重大挑战是纳米尺度物质的光学旋光分离，传统方法往往需要在增强旋光性的同时削弱非旋光性，而热运动等因素又会对过程产生不利影响。因此，寻找一种既能增强旋光性又同时保持非旋光性较低的方法是必要的。

Method: 通过利用纵向Mie振荡在硅纳米圆盘中实现光学旋光分离，具体方法包括：首先通过Azimuthally-Radially Polarized Beam (ARPB)照明 selectively激发纵向Mie振荡，接着利用磁四极量子捕获实现对分选的扭结物质的高选择度捕获。结合全波仿真和Kramers逃逸率理论，设计出一种高度稳定且高度选择的光学捕获系统。

Result: 研究成果表明，磁四极量子捕获能有效地分离出具有较大Pasteur参数κ的分选物质，即|κ|≥0.03时，捕获选择性超过100；而对于较弱的分选物质，|κ|≈0.006时，选择性仍超过2。这表明该方法在高选择度和稳定性方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了纵向Mie振荡在多折射率纳米结构中的优良性能，为非侵入式全光分析和旋光分离提供了新的平台。这对于材料科学、生物医学和其他需要高精度分选方法的领域具有重要的意义。

Abstract: Optical enantioseparation of nanoscale matter is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic weakness of chiroptical forces compared to the dominant achiral gradient forces and thermal fluctuations. Conventional plasmonic approaches typically enhance chirality at the cost of amplifying achiral attraction and heating. Here, we overcome this trade-off by exploiting longitudinal Mie resonances in silicon nanodisks. By employing an Azimuthally-Radially Polarized Beam (ARPB) illumination, we selectively excite longitudinal Mie resonances, with strong optical chirality gradients and comparatively uniform electric field intensities. Specifically, magnetic quadrupole (MQ) resonances, effectively decouple enantioselective forces from the achiral background, providing uniquely favorable conditions for enantioselective optical trapping. Combining full-wave simulations with Kramers' escape-rate theory, we demonstrate a robust trapping system that is both thermally stable and highly selective. We predict trapping selectivity ratios above 100 for particles with Pasteur parameters $|κ| \geq$ 0.03 and maintain selectivities above 2 even for weakly chiral analytes ($|κ| \approx$ 0.006). These results establish longitudinal Mie resonances in high-index dielectric nanostructures as a promising, non-invasive platform for all-optical chiral analysis and enantiomer separation.

Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption (TA) and transient reflectivity (TR) spectroscopies enable element-specific insights into attosecond-timescale processes in solids. XUV transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) is an emerging tool that combines the advantages of both absorption and reflectivity while offering intrinsically background-free detection. Here, we implement XUV-TGS by generating a transient grating in germanium solid using two few-cycle near-infrared pulses and probing it with an attosecond XUV pulse, produced via tabletop high-harmonic generation. The spectrally resolved, diffracted XUV pulses directly visualize the separate ultrashort decay times of both photoexcited electrons and holes, without the need for iterative deconvolution. By combining XUV-TA and -TG spectroscopy, we extract the evolution of the complex refractive index, ñ, without the need for Kramers-Kronig reconstruction, as required in XUV-TR, allowing us to extract the roots of the induced optical response. We find reflectivity changes of up to 34% via the real part of ñ, whereas changes in the imaginary part only result in a variation in reflectivity of around 0.5%.

Abstract: The next-generation sensing and communication applications rely on high-frequency microwave generation with low-noise. The microwave photonic technology is promising by the practical application is limited by its complex architecture so far. Here, we demonstrate an optically locked low-noise photonic microwave oscillator, so that all the optical components are packaged within a small module of 166 mL, and low noise microwave generation is achieved at 10.4 GHz with single-sideband phase noise of -54 dBc/Hz at 10 Hz, -141 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -162 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset. Above performance arises from a dual-laser self-injection-locking scheme to a single Fabry-Perot cavity with high Q exceeding 10^8, with over 20 dB common-mode noise suppression. The low-noise nature of such reference is coherently transferred to the X-band through a high-performance TFLN electro-optic comb chip, thereby overcoming long-standing barriers in photonic microwave integration to enable truly field-deployable low-noise microwave generation.

Motivation: The paper extends the scope of non-Hermitian systems in materials science by addressing correlated disorder, which is a current research interest in wave physics and material science.

Method: The authors propose theoretical frameworks for non-Hermitian hyperuniformity and stealthiness, develop a scattering-microstructure correspondence for open systems, and analyze materials using statistical crystallography.

Result: The proposed concepts generalize PT-symmetric crystals and reveal unique scattering properties in non-Hermitian materials, providing new tools for materials science.

Conclusion: The research bridges non-Hermitian wave physics with materials science, offering innovative approaches to correlated disorder and guiding the design of novel materials with specific optical properties.

Abstract: Symmetry-driven wave physics in open systems, exemplified by parity-time (PT) symmetry, has extended the landscape of crystalline phases in materials science to include gain-loss media. Given the growing interest in engineering disorder for wave manipulation, such non-Hermitian crystals motivate the extension of non-Hermitian frameworks into the realm of correlated disorder. Here, we propose hyperuniformity and stealthiness in non-Hermitian systems as a generalization of PT-symmetric crystals to correlated disorder. We extend the scattering-microstructure correspondence to open systems, formulating non-Hermitian hyperuniformity and stealthiness that encompass their Hermitian counterparts. This approach, incorporating a statistical crystallography framework for non-Hermitian materials, demonstrates that real-imaginary cross-correlations of the material potential are irrelevant for achieving hyperuniformity but are essential for characterizing stealthiness, revealing unidirectional scattering phases that are inaccessible in Hermitian materials and in non-Hermitian crystals. By analysing the microstructural statistics of the resulting materials, our results, building on non-Hermitian wave physics, establish a connection to materials science, encompassing conventional descriptors of correlated disorder.

Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), arising from quantum interference in coherently driven atomic systems, has inspired a variety of photonic analogues, such as coupled-resonator-induced transparency (CRIT) built on the quantum-state modelling using resonators. Although CRIT serves as a building block for slow light in photonic integrated circuits, recent advances in topological photonics motivate a further generalization of both EIT and CRIT using gauge-field degrees of freedom. Here, we propose generalized CRIT via a spinor representation with dual-channel gauge fields, enabling fully programmable CRIT featuring dynamical spectral engineering. We generalize the traditional EIT framework by introducing a spinor representation of bright- and dark-mode resonances, yielding a unified description of design parameters through universal unitary operations. Implementing a coupled-resonator building block that accesses the entire design space through dual-channel gauge fields, we demonstrate a programmable slow-light band in a one-dimensional CRIT lattice. These results address urgent needs in optical interconnects, such as tunable delay lines, reconfigurable synchronization, and linear frequency conversion.

Abstract: Optical computing provides a promising path toward energy-efficient machine learning, yet implementing nonlinear transformations without complex electronics or high-power sources remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that continuous-wave multimode fiber laser cavities can function as nonlinear optical processors. Input images encoded as phase patterns on a spatial light modulator undergo high-dimensional transformation through the interplay of multimode interference and gain saturation dynamics. The cavity maps input data into spatially stable, class-separable intensity distributions, enabling a simple linear classifier to achieve accuracies of 85--99\% across diverse benchmarks -- including medical imaging and remote sensing -- with orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than deep neural networks. Our results establish multimode fiber lasers as compact, low-power physical processors for scalable optical machine learning.

Abstract: The local polarization of the electromagnetic field plays a crucial role in the interaction of light with spin- and valley-polarized quantum sources. Unlike free-space electromagnetic waves, whose polarization degeneracy enables flexible polarization manipulation, planar integrated optical structures lack such degree of freedom owing to intrinsic structural anisotropy. Here, we propose a planar optical ring resonator based on a subwavelength grating waveguide that supports two quasi-degenerate modes. We demonstrate that coupling of these modes in the ring resonator leads to the formation of the resonances with a predominant direction of electric-field rotation in the vicinity of the resonator, resulting in the non-zero transverse optical spin. The average degree of circular polarization in the proposed structures reaches values of up to 70%. The theoretical predictions are corroborated by experimental validation in the microwave spectral range. Our findings suggest a viable route toward realization of on-chip optical spintronic and valleytronic interfaces.

*Mikolaj Krysa,Anna Chwastowicz,Malgorzata Lenarcik,Pawel Matrybak,Piotr Zdankowski,Maciej Trusiak*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A glycerol and tartrazine solution (GTS) improves quantitative phase imaging (QPI) by increasing tissue transparency while preserving morphology. It was used in Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) and lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) to demonstrate significant enhancements in imaging resolution and accuracy compared to traditional methods. GTS is stable, easy to prepare, and cost-effective, making it a viable alternative for routine hist pathology workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved optical clearing methods in tissue imaging to enhance resolution, accuracy, and efficiency in histopathology analysis.

Method: GTS was synthesized by mixing 60% glycerol and 10% tartrazine in water. Its effectiveness was tested in murine liver and kidney slices. Phase imaging techniques such as FPM and LDHM-PSR were used to evaluate transparency and structural details.

Result: GTS significantly increased transmission (50-80 microns) compared to PBS. Improved QPI results were observed with FPM and LDHM-PSR, characterized by higher resolution and reduced artifacts.

Conclusion: GTS offers a robust, accessible solution for enhancing QPI in histopathology, providing a cost-effective and easy-to-use alternative to advanced clearing agents like Ce3D.

Abstract: Thick tissue sections strongly scatter and absorb light, which limits transmission-based label-free examination via quantitative phase imaging (QPI) modalities. Here we introduce a simple, room-temperature optical clearing medium - glycerol and tartrazine solution (GTS; 60 percent glycerol, 10 percent tartrazine) - that increases the transparency of 50-80 micron murine liver and kidney slices while preserving tissue morphology and enabling rapid, label-free quantitative phase imaging. Using Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) and lensless digital holographic microscopy with pixel super-resolution (LDHM-PSR), we demonstrate markedly improved high-throughput visualization of microstructural features after GTS immersion compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The improvement is confirmed quantitatively by a significant increase in the one-pixel-lag autocorrelation of phase-gradient values, indicating reduced scattering-driven phase artifacts and enhanced structural continuity in reconstructed phase maps. We further show that GTS is stable for months at room temperature, provides instant yet durable clearing that improves over time, and can be removed by brief PBS washing, enabling downstream multimodal analyses on the same specimen. Finally, we benchmark GTS against the state-of-the-art clearing agent Ce3D, highlighting GTS as a low-cost, safe, operationally straightforward alternative with strong potential for routine, high-throughput QPI-based histopathology workflows.

Conclusion: The research paves the way for new technologies in optics and photonics by achieving a significant long-sought phenomenon through nonreciprocal electromagnetic response.

Abstract: We introduce a special kind of nonreciprocal electromagnetic response which gives rise to backscattering suppression in the bulk, a long-sought feature in topological photonics, as well as nonreciprocal lensing - an effect when the same structure focuses light incident from one direction and defocuses light propagating in the opposite way. We predict this response in spin spirals and in specially designed metamaterials, validating the key predictions.

Abstract: We develop a unified instantaneous-mode description for lasers with dispersive cavities, exploiting the separation of timescales between fast cavity fields and slow carrier dynamics. The resulting reduced rate equations retain the essential effects of frequency-dependent mirrors through a dynamic modal gain and an effective confinement factor determined directly by the mirror reflectivity. Applied to a Fano laser, the reduced description accurately reproduces the full dynamics and clarifies the physical origin of dispersive instabilities. More generally, the approach provides a transparent framework for reduced modeling and stability analysis of dispersive laser cavities.

Abstract: Matrix-vector multiplications are fundamental operations in artificial intelligence and high-throughput computations, and are executed repeatedly during training and inference. Their high energy cost in electronic processors motivate scalable photonic computing approaches that reduce the energy required per operation. Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) is a dominant photonic platform due to its large electro-optic effect. However, it lacks nonvolatile index tuning mechanisms, which promise to pave the way for energy-efficient photonic computing. Here, we explore electrochemical lithiation as a route to nonvolatile matrix-vector multiplications in TFLN. The LiNbO3 phase is stable at room temperature over a 2% Li composition window with an associated composition-dependent refractive index. We computationally demonstrate this as a programmable, low-loss approach to perform matrix-vector multiplications by using composition to control matrix weights. We design Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform image processing tasks under realistic material loss constraints. We also design microring resonators for iterative weight updates, using gradient descent training to program target matrix operations with matrix-vector multiplication accuracy validated at 1.5% average relative error. These demonstrations show a facile route towards nonvolatile photonic computing in TFLN, addressing a critical requirement for energy-efficient photonic matrix operations at scale.

Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of 3D ring-shaped and multipole vortical quantum droplets (QDs) in non-rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates held in a toroidal trapping potential. The QD dynamics are investigated in the framework of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which includes long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, revealing the emergence of self-bound states. Stable stationary solutions for multipole QDs with different values of the topological charge (vorticity $S$) are shaped as necklace-like modes, with the number of \textquotedblleft beads" (multipole's order) $n=2S$, up to $S=6$. The stability area of the multipoles shrinks with the increase of $S$. For higher values of $S$ the centrifugal effect associated with the phase winding destabilizes the annular density and drives the formation of fragmented multipole droplet states. The dependence of the chemical potential, total energy and peak density on the norm (number of particles) and $S$ is produced. These findings uncover the stabilizing effect of the LHY correction and DDI anisotropy in maintaining complex QD states in the non-rotating configurations.

Abstract: Computational discovery of magnetic materials remains challenging because magnetism arises from the competition between kinetic energy and Coulomb interaction that is often beyond the reach of standard electronic-structure methods. Here we tackle this challenge by directly solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation with neural-network variational Monte Carlo, which provides a highly expressive variational wavefunction for strongly correlated systems. Applying this technique to transition metal dichalcogenide moiré semicondutors, we predict itinerant ferromagnetism in WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ and an antiferromagnetic insulator in twisted $Γ$-valley homobilayer, using the same neural network without any physics input beyond the microscopic Hamiltonian. Crucially, both types of magnetic states are obtained from a single calculation within the $S_z=0$ sector, removing the need to compute and compare multiple $S_z$ sectors. This significantly reduces computational cost and paves the way for faster and more reliable magnetic material design.

Abstract: We study the half-filled Haldane-Holstein model, where a paradigmatic Chern insulator is coupled to fully dynamical phonons, and provide an unbiased characterization of how retarded electron-phonon interactions destabilize Chern topology. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: We investigate superconductivity in a bilayer nickelate system using a Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State method in virtual alkaline earth atoms. Our simulations, which include large lattices and various doping levels, reveal different pairing mechanisms as interlayer coupling changes, providing insights into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold-atom quantum simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 under pressure has sparked interest in understanding its underlying mechanisms. This paper aims to provide a detailed analysis of the system to shed light on the mechanisms of superconductivity in such materials and their relevance for cold-atom quantum simulation platforms.

Method: We study a mixed-dimensional t-parallel-J-parallel-J-perpendicular model proposed for the bilayer nickelate system. Using the neural quantum states (NQS), specifically the Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we perform calculations on large lattices (up to 8x8x2 sites) to analyze the ground-state properties and pairing behavior.

Result: The model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of doping levels and coupling constants. The pairing behavior changes significantly with interlayer exchange strength: tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs transform into more spatially extended BCS-like pairs as interlayer exchange decreases. Additionally, tuning the intralayer exchange leads to a sharp transition from interlayer s-wave pairing to intralayer d-wave pairing, which occurs consistently with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. Our results are validated against Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations, which demonstrate the accuracy of our computations. These are among the first simulations of a fermionic multi-orbital system using NQS, and provide the first numerical evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensional bilayers. The findings contribute significantly to the understanding of superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and inform the design of related quantum simulation platforms.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of superconductivity in bilayer systems by providing a comprehensive analysis of pairing mechanisms across varying coupling conditions. The use of state-of-the-art numerical methods not only validates the proposed model but also offers new insights into the physics of these materials, opening up opportunities for further theoretical and experimental investigations.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.

Abstract: Interaction effects are dramatically enhanced in flat-band systems due to quenched kinetics, facilitating the binding of single excitations into composite quasiparticles. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of spin polarons over the entire momentum and energy space within the Mielke-Tasaki model using projected exact diagonalization. We identify distinct low-energy spin polarons at momenta q=0 and q=π, and also find multiple high-energy branches of spin polaron. It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons. Furthermore, by introducing a finite bandwidth, we unravel the underlying binding mechanisms: the formation of low-energy spin polarons is governed by the conventional virtual exchange mechanism, whereas the high-energy spin polarons arise from a joint effect of the effective attraction and virtual exchange. Our results suggest promising avenues for realizing spin polaron crystals and exploring novel superconducting pairing mechanisms in moiré materials like twisted WSe2 and MoTe2.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids, a highly topologically entangled, dynamically correlated state where quantum fluctuations preclude any long-range ordering down to absolute zero. In the search for a topologically robust qubit, the scientific community has been in continuous hunt for real quantum spin liquid systems. Alexei Kitaev in his exactly solvable model for a spin-1/2 two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, presented a system that hosts a topologically protected state (Majorana zero-modes). Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates. However, the experimental findings continuously challenge the theoretical aspects, indicating the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in real materials, where the dimensionality, disorder (vacancy), chemical composition, generalized spin-S, and external perturbations (pressure, magnetic field, temperature) can actively tune the Kitaev interactions and the ground state excitations. In this review article, a comprehensive discussion is included with an updated literature survey in the context of the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a probe for Kitaev quantum spin liquids.

Abstract: The Weyl exceptional nodal lines usually occur in 3D topological semimetals, but also emerge in the parameter space of 1D systems. In this work, we study the impact of dissipation on the nodal ring in a 3D topological semimetal. We find that the energy spectrum becomes fully complex in the presence of dissipation, and the original nodal ring is split into two exceptional rings. We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings. We also propose a 1D model that has the same topological feature in the parameter space. It provides a simple way to measure the topological invariant in a low-dimensional system. Numerical simulations indicate that the topological invariant is robust under the random perturbations of the system parameters.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Hf substitution in UH3 enhances stability, allowing measurements of magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties. Results show that increasing Hf content suppresses the beta-UH3 phase towards alpha-UH3. Magnetization is ferromagnetic with optimal Curie temperatures around x=0.15. Magnetization decreases with higher Hf content (0.46 μB/U at x=0.40). Specific heat shows a reduction in electron density of states with increasing Hf, and resistivity increases with negative temperature coefficient. Transport properties are strongly incoherent, dominated by disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of Hf substitution on UH3 phase stabilization could provide valuable insights for materials science applications, particularly in the design of new materials with tailored magnetic and transport properties.

Method: The method involved synthesizing UH3 hydrides with varying Hf content through hydrogenation of UH3 precursors. The structural, magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties were measured and analyzed using techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, magnetization measurements, specific heat analysis, and resistivity measurements.

Result: Substitution of Hf into UH3 allows systematic measurement of its properties. At x=0.0, the beta-UH3 phase fully dominates. As x increases, the alpha-UH3 phase emerges and eventually dominates at x=0.30. The magnetization shows a peak around x=0.15, and the spontaneous magnetization decreases to 0.46 μB/U at x=0.40. Specific heat reveals a lowering of the electronic density of states with increasing Hf content. Resistivity is very high and exhibits a strong negative temperature coefficient, indicating strongly incoherent transport.

Conclusion: Hf substitution in UH3 can stabilize the metastable alpha-UH3 phase, making it a valuable tool for studying the magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of UH3 and its hydrides.

Abstract: Hf substitution stabilizes the metastable body-centered cubic (bcc) $α$-UH$3$ phase in uranium hydrides, enabling systematic measurements of its magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties. (UH$3$)${1-x}$Hf$x$ hydrides ($x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.30, 0.40$) were obtained by hydrogenation of U${1-x}$Hf$x$ precursor alloys. Powder X-ray diffraction shows a progressive suppression of $β$-UH$3$ phase with increasing $x$, with $α$-UH$3$ domination at $x = 0.30$ and $β$-UH$3$ nearly fully suppressed at $x = 0.40$. Magnetization measurements show ferromagnetic behavior for all compositions with Curie temperatures in the range $T\mathrm{C} \approx 178$--$185$ K and a maximum near $x = 0.15$; however, the spontaneous magnetization is strongly reduced with Hf content, decreasing from $1.0,μ\mathrm{B}$/U in pure $β$-UH$3$ to $0.46,μ\mathrm{B}$/U for (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. Specific-heat data show a broadened Curie anomaly in the $α$-UH$3$ rich hydride samples, consistent with a distribution of $T\mathrm{C}$ values arising from ferromagnetic inhomogeneities. Specific heat also reveals a monotonic decrease in the Sommerfeld coefficient with increasing Hf concentration, reflecting a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, especially in (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. The resistivity of (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$ is very large, exhibits a robust negative temperature coefficient over 2--300 K, and shows only weak magnetoresistance, placing transport in a strongly incoherent, disorder-dominated regime.

Abstract: Topological invariants govern many important physical properties in condensed matter systems. In this work, we obtain the complete set of topological invariants for a family of one-dimensional quasicrystals. The first and best-studied member of the family is the Fibonacci chain, while the successive ones are known in the literature as silver, bronze... and collectively as the metallic mean chains. By considering rational approximants, and by making use of the relationship between these chains and two dimensional Quantum Hall problems, we write down a gap labeling scheme for finite systems, and extend it to the quasiperiodic limit. We show, by numerical computations on open chains, that the proposed scheme correctly yields the winding numbers of edge states in each of the gaps, in all of the quasicrystals. In the strict 1D limit, we discuss properties of a simplified Hofstadter ``butterfly" diagram, with the analogues of Landau levels appearing in the asymptotic limit.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges and methods for simulating low-temperature properties of three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, particularly focusing on quantum spin liquids and their ground-state phases. Two models are examined: an antiferromagnetic J₁-J₂ model and a tetragonally-distorted variant of NaCa₂Cu₂(VO₄)₃. The J₁-J₂ model shows a first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear phases at J₂/J₁ = 0.705. The distorted model fails to reproduce the observed low-temperature magnetic properties, suggesting the need for additional effects beyond the studied models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding low-temperature magnetic properties of complex materials like quantum spin liquids is crucial for advancing condensed matter physics and potentially for applications in quantum technologies.

Method: Neural quantum states are employed to calculate ground-state phase diagrams for frustrated quantum spin models on a body-centered cubic lattice. The study uses computational methods to analyze phase transitions in the antiferromagnetic J₁-J₂ model and its tetragonally-distorted variant.

Result: While the antiferromagnetic J₁-J₂ model on the body-centered cubic lattice exhibits a reasonable phase transition between Néel and collinear phases, the tetragonally-distorted model does not adequately explain the magnetic properties of NaCa₂Cu₂(VO₄)₃, indicating that other effects must be incorporated to match experimental observations.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the importance of further investigating the ground-state properties of frustrated quantum magnets and propose that additional mechanisms or interactions are necessary to fully understand the magnetic behavior of materials like NaCa₂Cu₂(VO₄)₃.

Abstract: Simulating low-temperature properties of three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets is challenging due to the sign problem and the system sizes required to mitigate substantial finite-size effects. However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations.

Abstract: The distinctive symmetry properties of pure altermagnets make them natural candidates for piezomagnetism. Previous work motivated by the piezomagnetic properties of altermagnets has primarily focused on the spin magnetization response to applied strain. In this paper we study orbital piezomagnetic effects--the orbital magnetization response to applied strain--in minimal lattice models of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions. We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed.

Abstract: In this paper we apply the canonical spin wave theory developed for itinerant Kondo lattice magnets in the strong coupling regime to Kondo ferromagnets, and address two general questions pertaining to their magnetic excitations. First, we compute corrections to the strong coupling (i.e., double-exchange) spin wave dispersion of itinerant ferromagnets. We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly.

Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.

Abstract: The Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect is demonstrated for the first time at room temperature. The diamagnetic response of a silicon nanostructure with edge channels covered by chains of negative U dipole boron centers is studied when put in (removed from) an external magnetic field. Measurements of the diamagnetic response were carried out by recording the values of magnetization and generation currents. There is good agreement between the results of measurements of the generated internal magnetic field obtained using a ferroprobe and recording the EMF induced by the occurrence of generation currents in an external magnetic field, which determines the conditions of the mechanism of the nondissipative transport in the edge channels at room temperature, which is caused by their interactions with single carriers through negative U dipole boron centers. The interrelation of the magnetization hysteresis and the magnitude of the EMF induced by the occurrence of generation currents indicates the possibilities of the electrical registration of the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in nanostructures manufactured within the framework of the Hall geometry.

Abstract: Majorana zero modes, the elementary building blocks for the quantum bits of topological quantum computers, are known to suffer from hybridization as their wavefunctions begin to overlap. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, splitting their energy levels and leading to an accumulation of error when performing topological quantum gates. Here we show that the energy splitting of the Majorana zero modes can become negative, which can be utilized to reduce the average hybridization energy of the total gate. We present two illustrative examples where negative hybridization suppresses gate errors to such an extent that they remain below the fault-tolerance threshold. As an intrinsic property of Majorana zero modes, negative hybridization enables systems based on imperfect Majorana zero modes to regain functionality for quantum information processing.

Motivation: Quantum computing relies on stable qubits; this work explores mobile spin qubits for scalability and flexibility in quantum processors.

Method:  passive reduction of magnetic fields, motional narrowing with periodic shuttling, dynamic decoupling via pulses, and dressed-state shuttling used for error suppression.

Result: zn improved coherence times: up to 32 µs with repeated dynamic decoupling, 11.5 µs with motional narrowing, and 8.5 µs with active reduction.

Conclusion: mobile spin qubits are viable for scalable silicon quantum processors thanks to these coherence enhancements.

Abstract: Mobile spin qubit architectures promise flexible connectivity for efficient quantum error correction and relaxed device layout constraints, but their viability rests on preserving spin coherence during transport. While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\,μ\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\,μ\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\,\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\,μ\text{s}$. For the same setup, we demonstrate that dressed-state shuttling provides robust protection against low-frequency noise with a decay time $T_R^{\text{sh}} = 21\,μ\text{s}$, without the overhead of pulsed control and allowing protection during one-way spin transport. By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the three-dimensional (3D) electron dynamics of graphene in real space under strong laser fields using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We successfully reproduce the reversal of current direction originating from the cancellation of two oppositely directed residual currents, as previously predicted by Morimoto et al. [Y. Morimoto et al., New J. Phys. 24, 033051 (2022)]. By distinguishing contributions from individual orbitals, our results validate the two-level system approximation and also emphasize that the first-principles approach agrees better with experimental results for light-driven residual current, especially in extremely strong fields. Furthermore, our 3D model reveals that the real-space atomic-scale current induced by strong laser fields is concentrated slightly above and below the graphene basal plane, rather than strictly within it. The two oppositely directed currents exhibit a pronounced height separation in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the ring current is not confined to the graphene plane but forms a rotating 3D circulation loop which is absent in the reduced-dimensional model.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.

Abstract: Moiré superlattices formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers have emerged as an exciting platform to explore the quantum many-body physics. The key mechanism is the introduction of moiré potentials for the band-edge carriers induced by the lateral modulation of interlayer interactions. This trapping potential results in the formation of flat bands, which enhances the strong correlation effect. However, a full understanding of the origin of this intriguing potential remains elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the origin of moiré potentials in both R-type and H-type moiré patterns formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. We show that both lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer contribute significantly to the formation of moiré potentials. In particular, the lattice reconstruction induces a nonuniform local strain, which creates an energy modulation of 200 meV for the conduction band-edge state located at WS$_2$ layer and 20 meV for the valence band-edge state located at WSe$_2$ layer. In addition, the lattice reconstruction also introduces a piezopotential energy, whose amplitude ranges from 40 meV to 90 meV depending on the stacking and band-edge carrier. The interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in an energy modulation of 80 meV for an R-type moiré and 40 meV for an H-type moiré. Taking into account both effects from lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer, the formation of moiré potential is well understood for both R-type and H-type moirés. This trapping potential localizes the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands around the same moiré site for an R-type moiré, while around different moiré site for an H-type one.

Abstract: We investigate spin-wave propagation in magnetic insulators in the presence of lattice dislocations. Within a continuum magnetoelastic framework, we show that the strain fields generated by dislocations induce equilibrium magnetic textures. The morphology of these textures depends sensitively on the dislocation type and acts as a localized scattering potential for spin-wave excitations. As a result, the scattering response exhibits pronounced asymmetries and interference effects governed by the magnetoelastic coupling and the dislocation type. By combining numerical simulations with analytical scattering theory, we compute differential cross sections and frequency-dependent transmission coefficients. Furthermore, analysis of the effective potential landscape reveals that the defect forms a barrier that modulates spin-wave transport and, crucially, breaks the intrinsic reflectionless nature of magnetic domain walls. Our findings identify lattice dislocations as tunable scattering centers, opening new avenues for defect engineering in magnonic devices.

Abstract: Topological insulators host exotic quantum phenomena such as the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, which enables dissipationless one-dimensional edge conduction. Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in α-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes α Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems.

Motivation: The discovery of high harmonic spin and charge pumping in alternate magnetic systems could lead to advanced nonlinear spintronic devices and THz emitters, with potential applications in nanotechnology and optoelectronics.

Method: Nonlinear spin-momentum coupling in alternate magnetic materials was studied through extensive numerical simulations under magnetic field-driven non-equilibrium conditions.

Result: The research revealed that alternate magnetic systems can exhibit the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes that surpass those found in light-driven systems. The systems' ability to perform spin and charge pumping without additional spin-orbit coupling sets them apart from conventional magnetic systems.

Conclusion: Alternate magnetic systems demonstrate exceptional potential for advancing nonlinear spintronic devices and THz emitters, marking a significant breakthrough in material science and nanotechnology.

Abstract: We report the emergence of highly nonlinear spin and charge pumping in an altermagnetic system driven by magnetic dynamics. The nonrelativistic spin-momentum coupling inherent to altermagnets generates a giant momentum dependent spin splitting, leading to strong spin-flip scattering in the presence of a precessing magnetic order driving the altermagnetic system out of equilibrium. Our simulations reveal the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes far exceeding those obtained in light-driven schemes. Notably, in contrast to ferromagnetic and conventional antiferromagnetic systems, where nonlinear emission typically requires additional spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets intrinsically support high-harmonic spin and charge pumping. These results identify altermagnetic systems as a promising platform for efficient THz emitters and highly nonlinear spintronic devices.

Abstract: Conduction band-edge spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides determines a competition between bright and dark excitons and sets conditions for spintronics applications of these semiconductors. Here, we report the SOS measurement for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$, found from the threshold density, $n_*$, for the upper spin-orbit-split band population, which exceeds by an order of magnitude the values expected from the conventional density functional theory (DFT). Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states. An optimised choice of Hubbard U/V parameters produces close agreement with the experimentally observed conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$, simultaneously resulting in the valence-band SOS and the quasi-particle band gap which are closer to their values established in the earlier-published experiments.

Abstract: Spin qubits are typically operated in the lowest orbital of a quantum dot to minimize interference from nearby states. In valence-band hole systems, strong spin-orbit coupling links spin and orbital degrees of freedom, strongly influencing the hole $g$-factor, a key parameter for qubit control. We investigate the out-of-plane $g$-factor in Ge quantum dots using excitation (single-particle) and addition (many-body) spectra. Excitation spectra allow us to distinguish the pure Zeeman $g$-factor from orbital contributions to the magnetic field splitting of states despite the strong spin-orbit coupling. This distinction clarifies discrepancies between $g$-factors extracted with the two methods, for different orbital states and different hole numbers. Furthermore, we find gate-tunability of $g$-factors at the level of 15%, highlighting its relevance for all-electric qubit manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging and characterizing sub-micron and nanoparticles is tough with current 3D ED methods, especially with beam-sensitive samples. Brookite and CsPbBr3 nanoparticles tested the method's feasibility.

Result: Enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, reduced beam exposure time. Able to analyze multiple particles from a single dataset. Broke limitations for 3D ED method applicability.

Conclusion: This approach extends the use of 3D ED methods to previously challenging samples and nanoparticles, overcoming technical limitations.

Abstract: Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has emerged as a powerful method for solving the structures of sub-micron-sized particles down to nanoparticles. However, it faces technical challenges when applied to beam-sensitive samples or conglomerated and agglomerated nanoparticles. This study presents a novel approach that combines 4D-STEM tomography with object tracking and segmentation algorithms to overcome these limitations and achieve single-crystalline 3D ED datasets from nanopowder samples. The method and data quality are assessed on brookite TiO2 nanorods and beam-sensitive CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. To finely sample the reciprocal-space, the data acquisition was automated to acquire hundreds of 4D-STEM scans using a slightly convergent beam and at fine tilt steps. The proposed method provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, low illumination time for reducing beam damage, and the ability to analyze multiple particles from a single tomographic dataset. The procedure is optimized to be feasible using commercially available desktops and detectors. This extends the method applicability in the community to the systems and samples that were previously inaccessible for conventional 3D ED methods, particularly breaking the technical challenges for the data acquisition.

Abstract: Next-generation high-energy electron-positron colliders, operating as Higgs factories, require an unprecedented jet energy resolution for precision measurements of Higgs and Z/W bosons. To address this challenge, a conceptual design is presented for a novel high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter that combines the superior intrinsic energy resolution of a homogeneous calorimeter with the fine segmentation required for particle-flow reconstruction. The crystal electromagnetic calorimeter design is based on orthogonally arranged long scintillating crystal bars read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at both ends. Key design specifications were established through comprehensive simulation studies. Critical technical considerations, including crystal choices, photosensors, electronics, mechanical support, and radiation damage, are discussed. A dedicated digitisation framework was developed to realistically model effects from the crystal, SiPMs, and readout electronics. The performance of a single calorimeter module was evaluated using simulated electron showers. Simulation results for a single module demonstrate an excellent electromagnetic energy resolution of $1.12\%/\sqrt{E(\mathrm{GeV})}\oplus0.24\%$ and an energy linearity within $\pm0.5\%$ for electrons from 3 GeV to 100 GeV. The performance significantly exceeds the design requirement of $\leq 3\%/\sqrt{E(\mathrm{GeV})}\oplus1\%$. The results establish the feasibility of the proposed high-granularity crystal calorimeter concept and point to a promising pathway toward the precision calorimetry required for future high-energy electron-positron collider experiments.
