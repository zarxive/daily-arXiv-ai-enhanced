Motivation: 研究射频腔体中输入耦合器不匹配带来的系统误差及其影响，寻找一种准确计算腔体功率损耗及固有品质因子的方法。

Method: 推导了一种间接计算功率损耗和固有品质因子的公式。主要利用拾取器的信号来推断输入耦合器发出波的幅度，并通过图形化方法进行自洽性检查。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效地减少系统误差，精确计算出射频腔体的功率损耗和固有品质因子。

Abstract: In the case of a radio-frequency (RF) cavity with a mismatched input coupler, a direct calculation of the power dissipation in the cavity and the intrinsic quality factor from continuous-wave (CW) measurements may have uncertainty due to systematic errors. Formulae for an indirect calculation of these quantities are derived for the case of a cavity with two couplers of fixed coupling strength. In this approach, the signal from the pickup coupler is used to infer the amplitude of the "emitted wave" from the input coupler. A graphical method for self-consistency assessment is evaluated. The impact of frequency offsets is considered. Applications of these methods are presented, drawing on cold tests of superconducting cavities produced for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.

Conclusion: 非线性扰动的哈密尔顿系统在近似无理频比下存在稳定的近似积分，而对于有理频比的情况，可以找到特定的积分形式来近似描述系统行为。

Abstract: We consider a formal (approximate) integral of motion in Hamiltonians of the form $H=\frac{1}{2}(X^2+Y^2+ω_1^2x^2+ω_2^2y^2)+ε(ηxy^2+αx^3+βx^2y+γy^3)$ generalizing previous cases with $β=γ=0$. First we give the general form of this integral when $ω_1/ω_2$ is irrational and then we consider the case of commensurable frequencies. In particular we study the integrals for the resonances $ω_1/ω_2=4/1, 5/1, 3/2, 4/3, 3/1$ and $2/1$. We also calculate the invariant curves and the orbits in the cases $ω_1/ω_2=2/1$ and $1/1$ (with $β=γ=0$) and we compare the exact-numerical and the theoretical results predicted by the formal integral when $βγ\neq0$. In the special case $ω_1/ω_2=1/1$ we find an integral when $β=γ=0$ and $ηα\neq0$ or $η=α=0$ and $βγ\neq 0$, but this is not possible when $ηαβγ\neq 0$. However, we find that the invariant curves and the orbits can be approximated by a non-resonant integral with $ω_1/ω_2=5\sqrt{2}/7=1.010\dots$.

Result: 在磁滞区中发现平均等待时间在某一特定温度达到极大值，证实了相变中的共振现象。研究揭示了该现象与系统中是否存在粒子（如标量粒子或孤立子）之间的内在联系，并为理解不同相的量子与经典性质提供了新的视角。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为理解Ising模型中相变机制提供了新的观察，也为探索有限尺寸系统中的量子相与经典相的分界线提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In finite-size systems undergoing a continuous phase transition, the passage from the symmetric phase to the broken-symmetry phase is accomplished through a hysteresis zone, up to spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In the present work, we find that a resonance phenomenon takes place within this zone. This resonance is manifested as a maximization of the mean waiting time as a function of temperature inside the hysteresis region. An interesting issue concerns how this resonance is connected with the existence of particles (tachyons) or quasiparticles (kink solitons) within the hysteresis zone. Finally, we introduce the idea that this resonance delineates a continuous passage from a "classical" phase to a "quantum" phase for a binary system, such as the three-dimensional Ising model, which belongs to the same universality class as a fermion-antifermion system or, more generally, a matter-antimatter system.

Result: 成功测量了N@C60的g因子为2.00209909(3)，并验证了液相参考方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了高磁场EPR光谱仪的可行性，为更精确的材料研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a valuable tool for physics, chemistry, biology and medicine, providing complementary spectroscopic information to NMR. It has long been known that EPR at high magnetic fields offers greater spectral resolution, but limitations in the THz instrumentation have prevented the full realization of these opportunities. Here we describe an EPR spectrometer at the high magnetic field of 14 T using 396 GHz excitation, which adapts techniques from liquid-state NMR to obtain sharp EPR resonances with a width of 210 ppb (full-width half-maximum). We use this to measure resonance positions, and hence g-factors, with a precision that reaches $\pm$16 ppb. Our use of in-situ liquid-state NMR of our solvent within the same sample improves the accuracy of these measurements: it allows us to reference our EPR measurement back to dilute gas 3He NMR for which quantum calculations are accurate. We measure the g-factor of N@C60 in deuterated toluene as g = 2.002 099 09 (3), where the 3 in brackets means that the uncertainty on the last digit is $\pm$3.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel compact particle identification (PID) detector concept based on Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) optimized to perform combined Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) and Time-of-Flight (TOF) measurements using a common photodetector layer. The system consists of a Cherenkov radiator layer separated from a photosensitive surface equipped with SiPMs by an expansion gap. A thin glass slab, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is coupled to the SiPMs to perform Cherenkov-based charged particle timing measurements. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM array sensors with pixel pitches ranging from 2 to 3 mm and coupled with 1 mm thick fused silica window. The RICH radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line with pions and protons. We measured a single-hit angular resolution of about 4 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value and a time resolution better than 50 ps RMS for charged particles with Z = 1. The present technology makes the proposed SiPM-based PID system particularly attractive for space applications due to the limited detector volumes available. In this work, we present beam test results obtained with the detector prototype and we discuss possible configurations optimized for the identification of ions in space applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses ToF measurement in particle detectors by coupling a thin Cherenkov radiator to SiPM arrays. High refractive index materials like fused silica are used to enable prompt Cherenkov radiation for fast signals. The study incorporates a Monte Carlo simulation and beam tests to evaluate the time resolution and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity for precise charged particle ToF measurements, commonly used in high-energy physics and other scientific fields, drives this research. Cherenkov radiation, being prompt, offers superior time resolution, making it an ideal candidate for such applications.

Method: The research methodology involves two main components: first, a detailed Monte Carlo simulation to predict the expected time resolution and performance of the coupling system. Second, beam tests are conducted to validate these theoretical predictions and assess real-world performance.

Result: The study reveals the main factors affecting time resolution, such as radiator material and thickness, along with the optical coupling efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations are performed and compared with beam test results, providing a comprehensive analysis of the system's effectiveness in achieving desired time resolution.

Conclusion: By optimizing radiator materials and optical coupling, the system achieves high time resolution. The comparison between simulation and beam test results strengthens the validity of the proposed design approach. These findings can be applied to improve ToF detectors in various scientific domains, offering more precise tracking capabilities for high-energy particles.

Abstract: Dedicated R&D efforts are currently underway to couple a thin Cherenkov radiator to Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays for precise charged particle Time-of-Flight (ToF) measurements. The prompt nature of Cherenkov radiation makes it an ideal candidate for achieving ultimate timing performance in a ToF detector. Using a thin radiator with a high refractive index, such as fused silica, enables the generation of a fast signal from charged particles that exceed the Cherenkov threshold. A crucial requirement for approaching the target time resolution is the optimization of both the radiator material and thickness, as well as the optical coupling to the SiPM arrays. In this work, we present the main factors that affect the time resolution and the expected performance achieved through a detailed Monte Carlo simulation and the comparison with beam test results.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the excitation of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in gravitational lensing by a Schwarzschild black hole using a scalar field model. By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this study, we explore the relation between generalised entropies and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) models. Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with Rényi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles.

Abstract: We investigate the detectability of post-Newtonian higher harmonics from Galactic double white dwarfs in the centihertz band ($\sim 0.01$ Hz). Using a synthetic population, we show that, unlike the quadrupole mode, higher harmonics remain undetectable with LISA except for rare nearby systems. In contrast, planned mid-band (decihertz) observatories such as DECIGO and BBO will be able to detect the third harmonic for about 10\% of inspiral binaries above $\sim 5$ mHz, enabling statistical constraints on mass ratios. These results highlight the successive roles of LISA and future decihertz missions in establishing a coherent strategy for space-based gravitational-wave astronomy.

Abstract: We examine the role of angular momentum in general relativity from both heuristic and fully covariant perspectives, with the aim of clarifying conceptual ambiguities that arise when Newtonian intuition is extrapolated into the relativistic regime. Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.

Abstract: In this analysis, we investigate the polarization radiation imaging of Kerr-Newman black holes, with a particular focus on the impact of black hole charge on photon propagation and polarization characteristics. By extending the traditional Walker-Penrose method, which is limited by its reliance on specific symmetric structures and Killing tensors, we overcome these limitations by constructing an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerical framework that combines the photon orbit equation with the polarization parallel transport equation. This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks. Our results show that black hole charge can significantly modify photon trajectories and polarization patterns: increasing charge compresses and distorts the EVPA structure on photon-ring scales, inducing localized rotations and asymmetries that may provide a potential diagnostic of a nonzero black hole charge.

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.

Abstract: Massive spin-2 fields in addition to the standard massless graviton arise naturally in extensions of General Relativity, such as massive bigravity or models with extra dimensions. This work explores the observational signatures of these fields on the propagation of gravitational waves. Adopting a phenomenological framework consistent with such theories, we derive an analytical transfer function in the ultrarelativistic limit and establish detectability bounds. Finally, we provide forecasts for the accessible parameter space using current and future gravitational wave detectors.

### [18] [Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15226)
*Patrick Hu,Robert J. Scherrer*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper provides exact solutions for a scalar field evolution in a universe dominated by a stiff fluid, including logarithmic potentials, and analyzes their applicability compared to traditional slow-roll approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the exact dynamics of scalar fields in cosmological contexts, especially under varying potential forms and early universe conditions, is fundamental for theoretical physics and cosmology.

Method: The authors derive exact solutions by solving differential equations for different potential forms and then compare these solutions to slow-roll approximations.

Result: While logarithmic potentials allow for exact solutions, these are less useful in typical cosmological scenarios compared to solutions for barotropic fluids. The generalized slow-roll approximation is applicable only in specific conditions.

Conclusion: This work extends the understanding of scalar field cosmologies but highlights limitations in using traditional slow-roll methods except in highly specific cases like a vacuum-dominated universe.

Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $φ$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B > -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B > -1$.

Abstract: Developing epithelial tissues coordinate cell proliferation and mechanical forces to achieve proper size and shape. As epithelial cells tightly adhere together to form the confluent tissue, the distribution of cell areas significantly influences possible patterns of cellular packing and thereby also the mechanics of the epithelium. Therefore, it is important to understand the origin of cell area heterogeneity in developing tissues and, if possible, how to control it. Previous models of cell growth and division have been successful in accounting for experimentally observed area distributions in cultured cells and bacterial colonies, but developing tissues present additional complexity due to self-organized patterns of mechanical stresses that guide morphogenesis. Here, we address this challenge focusing on the D. melanogaster wing disc epithelium. We consider a simple model that couples cell cycle dynamics to tissue mechanics. From time-lapse imaging of the cellular network, we extract all model parameters - cell growth rates, division rates, and mechanical fluctuations - revealing that they all depend on cell size. With these independently measured parameters, our model quantitatively reproduces the observed cell area distribution without any fitting parameters and further predicts tissue pressure gradients, in quantitative agreement with previously published data. Importantly, we find that cell proliferation accounts for 85% of cell area variance, establishing it as the dominant source of packing disorder that influences tissue mechanics and organization.

Abstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley equations have described neuronal excitability for seventy years, yet their mathematical structure-gating exponents m3h and n4, exponential voltage dependencies, and bounded activation variables, has remained empirically justified rather than theoretically derived. Hodgkin and Huxley introduced voltage-dependent conductances controlled by gating variables. While these equations reproduce experimental observations, they were derived through curve-fitting without theoretical justification. Modern theoretical physics derives governing equations from symmetry principles through Lie group theory. We prove that the complete Hodgkin-Huxley equations necessarily follow from three fundamental symmetries: (1) compact conformational state spaces, (2) multiplicative conductance scaling, and (3) temporal translation invariance. These symmetries uniquely determine a Lie group structure isomorphic to SO(2) semidirect product with R2. From representation theory, we derive: boundedness from SO(2) compactness, exponential Boltzmann factors from scale invariance, specific integer exponents m3h and n4 from irreducible representations, and first-order kinetics from Lie algebra flows. This demonstrates that the HH equations are not empirical curve-fits but the unique mathematical structure mandated by fundamental symmetries. We reveal why gating variables must be bounded, voltage dependencies must be exponential, sodium requires three activation gates and one inactivation gate, potassium requires four activation gates, and kinetics must be first-order. This establishes that neural electrophysiology obeys the same theoretical framework as modern physics, where symmetries determine dynamics, providing a foundation for understanding channel mutations and network dynamics through group theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between radiation field characteristics and biological damage is crucial for radiotherapy and radioprotection. This study aims to develop a model that can predict cell survival by analyzing energy deposition at different spatial scales, addressing an understudied aspect in these fields.

Method: We developed an interpretable deep learning model using the PIDE dataset. The model incorporates sequential attention to identify important features. Key energy deposition quantities such as LET (linear energy transfer), nanodosimetric, and microdosimetric data are simulated using advanced tools like MC-Startrack and Open-TOPAS. This approach allows for multi-scale analysis of energy deposition and its biological effects.

Result: Our model achieved high predictive accuracy for in vitro experiments. It highlights the importance of considering multiple spatial scales in predicting cell survival after irradiation. Smaller spatial domain quantities have a greater influence on the outcome, and the model provides Insight into how energy deposition scales contribute to biological effects.

Conclusion: This study advances our understanding of how multi-scale energy deposition affects cell survival during radiation therapy. The developed model offers a transparent tool for predicting and optimizing radiation therapy outcomes, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale characterization in both radiotherapy and radioprotection applications.

Abstract: The relationship between the physical characteristics of the radiation field and biological damage is central to both radiotherapy and radioprotection, yet the link between spatial scales of energy deposition and biological effects remains not entirely understood. To address this, we developed an interpretable deep learning model that predicts cell survival after proton and carbon ion irradiation, leveraging sequential attention to highlight relevant features and provide insight into the contribution of different energy deposition scales. Trained and tested on the PIDE dataset, our model incorporates, beside LET, nanodosimetric and microdosimetric quantities simulated with MC-Startrack and Open-TOPAS, enabling multi-scale characterization. While achieving high predictive accuracy, our approach also emphasizes transparency in decision-making. We demonstrate high accuracy in predicting RBE for in vitro experiments. Multiple scales are utilized concurrently, with no single spatial scale being predominant. Quantities defined at smaller spatial domains generally have a greater influence, whereas the LET plays a lesser role.

Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous phase transitions exhibits nonequilibrium universality. While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts universal scaling of point-like defect numbers under slow driving, the statistical properties of extended defects remain largely unexplored across both slow and fast protocols. We investigate vortex string formation in a three-dimensional holographic superfluid. For slow quenches, the vortex string number follows KZM scaling, while for rapid quenches, it exhibits complementary universal scaling governed by the final temperature. Beyond the vortex string number, the loop-length distribution reveals a richer structure: individual loops follow the first-return statistics of three-dimensional random walks, $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-5/2}$. While the total vortex length distribution remains Gaussian, its cumulants obey universal scaling laws with varying power-law exponents, and thus differ markedly from those observed in point-defect systems, indicating distinct statistical features of extended topological defects.

Abstract: In quantum field theory, entanglement entropy under spatial bipartitioning serves as a powerful information-theoretic probe of quantum correlations. In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena.

Abstract: We search for a logarithmic 3-form representing the 6-point MHV gravity amplitude, requiring poles only on physical channels and residues matching factorization. Working in the Orlik-Solomon algebra on a De Concini-Procesi wonderful model, we restrict to the S3 x S3 invariant subspace and impose factorization boundary-by-boundary. The intersection of ten compatible 3|3 channels with two compatible 2-particle channels collapses to a unique one-dimensional candidate line. However, enforcing factorization on a crossing channel obstructs any single-valued global representative. We find that an orbit-mixed form, a linear combination over 20 permutation images indexed by bipartitions, satisfies the crossing constraint. This is consistent with a local-system picture: the global gravity form lives in a rank-20 bundle whose monodromy mixes bipartition chambers rather than flipping a single sign. All code and data are provided for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Ghost inflation with a quadratic dispersion relation offers a promising avenue for explaining enhanced non-Gaussianity within cosmological Collider frameworks. While initial tensions with observations exist, modifications to the model can potentially align it with current data, making it a worthy subject for further investigation. } 

Abstract: Ghost inflation is a well-known framework in which cosmological fluctuations can generate enhanced primordial non-Gaussianity, typically of the equilateral type. In its original form, however, it is in tension with current observational constraints. Here we instead consider a setup in which a standard inflaton drives the background evolution, while excitations of a ghost condensate act as spectator fields that interact with the inflaton. This proposal fits naturally within the cosmological collider program: the exchanged particle has a modified dispersion relation, $ω\propto k^2$. We show that this ghost-inspired dynamics weakens the usual Boltzmann suppression, similarly to models with a very small effective sound speed, yielding an enhanced bispectrum signal relative to standard cosmological collider scenarios. At the same time, the horizon-crossing scale remains a free parameter of the theory. As a result, the model shares features of both the de Sitter bootstrap and boostless frameworks. Finally, we derive the differential equations governing cosmological correlators in the ghost-collider setup. Their structure reflects the quadratic momentum dependence of the dispersion relation and distinguishes this scenario from conventional relativistic cases.

Abstract: This thesis develops a unified framework that reconstructs the full classical content of General Relativity from the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes. By interpreting the analytic structure of amplitudes as the field-theoretic imprint of spacetime geometry, the work establishes a direct correspondence between quantum processes and classical gravitational observables such as metrics, deflection angles, and multipole moments. Starting from the effective-field-theory description of gravity, the thesis shows that loop amplitudes encode not only quantum corrections but also the nonlinear classical self-interaction of the gravitational field, enabling the systematic derivation of the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational quantities by rewriting the Einstein equations in terms of graviton scattering processes. Building upon this foundation, the framework is applied to rotating and charged sources in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. A momentum-space formulation of the energy-momentum tensor is then developed, introducing gravitational form factors and source multipoles that link, for the first time, the internal matter distribution to the external multipolar field in a completely relativistic framework. Furthermore, the thesis completes the transition from the microscopic amplitude picture to the macroscopic description of gravitational sources by engineering a multipole-based framework for black hole mimickers, then applied to build horizon-less compact objects mimicking the multipolar structure of Kerr black holes. Finally, exploiting the Kerr-Schild gauge, the Fourier transforms of rotating black hole metrics are computed in closed form, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative descriptions of gravity, and allowing to probe the multipolar structure of higher-dimensional solutions employing scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: We compute the gluonic contribution to the gravitational form factors of the proton using the improved holographic QCD model, in which the proton is described in terms of bulk Dirac fermions. Model parameters are constrained using lattice and phenomenological input, allowing us to obtain estimates for the gravitational form factors and to compare them with results from other approaches. The resulting $\mathcal{D}(t)$ form factor is found to exhibit an infrared pole in our framework. Using the extracted form factors, we analyze mechanical properties of the proton, including pressure and shear distributions. We obtain estimates of $ρ_\text{mech} = 0.95$ fm and $ρ_\text{mass} = 0.61$ fm for the mechanical and the mass radii of the proton, respectively, which are similar to values in other nonperturbative studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Carroll hydrodynamics models non-relativistic systems with symmetries similar to the Poincaré group, incorporating spin. Extending it with spin is important for applications in condensed matter or early universe physics where spin degrees of freedom are relevant.

Method: Starting from relativistic hydrodynamics with spin, perform the c→0 limit with a pre-ultralocal geometry for the background. This leads to equations of motion for Carrollian fluids with spin while preserving the spin structure.

Result: Carroll hydrodynamics with spin is equivalent to the c→0 limit of relativistic hydrodynamics with spin under specific geometric and dynamic assumptions.

Conclusion: This work bridges the c→0 limit in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin to Carrollian hydrodynamics, providing a foundation for analyzing non-relativistic systems with spin such as in condensed matter or cosmology with spin-related phenomena.

Abstract: We formulate Carroll hydrodynamics with the inclusion of a spin current. Our strategy relies on the fact that the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics yields the equations of Carroll hydrodynamics. Starting with the pre-ultralocal parametrization of the background geometry and the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom for a relativistic fluid endowed with a spin current, the $c\to 0$ limit produces Carroll hydrodynamics with spin. It is known that boost-invariant hydrodynamic models for ultrarelativistic fluids relevant for the physics of quark-gluon plasma, such as Bjorken and Gubser flow, are manifestations of Carroll hydrodynamics under appropriate geometric choices for the underlying Carrollian structure. In this work, we further this mapping between such boost-invariant models and Carroll hydrodynamics, now with the inclusion of a spin current.

Abstract: The multicritical generalizations of the Lee-Yang universality class arise as renormalization-group fixed points of scalar field theories with complex $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ interaction, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, just below their upper critical dimension. It has been recently conjectured that their continuation to two dimensions corresponds to the non-unitary conformal minimal models $\mathcal{M}(2,2n+3)$. Motivated by that, we revisit the functional renormalization group approach to complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric scalar field theories in the Local Potential Approximation, without or with wavefunction renormalization (LPA and LPA' respectively), aiming to explore the fate of the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ theories from their upper critical dimension to two dimensions. The $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points are identified using a perturbative expansion of the functional fixed-point equation near their upper critical dimensions, and they are followed to lower dimensions by numerical integration of the full equation. A peculiar feature of the complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $η$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $Δ=(d-2+η)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n>1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points.

Abstract: We study the partial-wave expansion of residues of five-point tree-amplitude involving identical scalar particles in the external legs. We check the construction using massive spinor-helicity building blocks and by matching to the tree-level five-point Veneziano amplitude at fixed mass levels. As an application, we express five-point splitting constraints - the reduction of the five-point amplitude to products of four-point amplitudes on special kinematic loci - as linear relations among the five-point partial-wave coefficients. At low mass levels these constraints, together with spin truncation, fix the full five-point partial-wave data in terms of the four-point coefficients and imply simple compatibility conditions; remarkably, imposing two independent splitting loci also forces the residue to vanish on their intersection, making the associated hidden zero manifest in partial-wave space. We also show that once both channels allow spin-2 exchange a genuine kernel can remain, indicating the need for additional higher-point input to achieve complete rigidity.

Abstract: It is not understood whether scale-separated AdS vacua in string theory admit a holographic dual. A well-known class of such vacua is provided by the DGKT solutions of massive type IIA string theory, where scale separation arises from large fluxes. In this work, we construct a ten-dimensional brane geometry whose near-horizon limit reproduces the DGKT vacua, using a flux-backtracking approach combined with intersecting D4-brane stacks dual to the unbounded flux sector. We then use this setup to test whether the brane worldvolume theory decouples from the bulk. Modes localised near the branes, deep in the AdS throat, are found to be infinitely redshifted with respect to asymptotic observers. Moreover, an analysis of graviton fluctuations shows the presence of an infinite potential barrier near the branes, providing a direct indication of decoupling. We conclude by comparing these results with recent arguments against decoupling in scale-separated AdS vacua, which focus on the asymptotic region where modes are blueshifted.

Abstract: We construct a natural and nonperturbative momentum space for quantum field theory on $(d+1)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime in the Poincaré slicing, adapted to early Universe cosmology. In particular, we identify the dS frequency as the unitary-representation label of the dS isometry group $\mathrm{SO}(1, d+1)$. By diagonalizing the quadratic Casimir together with spatial translations, we provide a harmonic expansion of operators in what we call the Kontorovitch-Lebedev-Fourier (KLF) space. This momentum space shares many structural properties with its Minkowski counterpart, for instance: equations of motion reduce to algebraic equations, and the quadratic dynamics provides a simple propagator analogous to flat space. We reformulate the perturbative computation of in-in correlators in KLF momentum space, showing from first principles how time integrals turn into frequency-space integrals over meromorphic functions. We show how our construction streamlines computations, naturally accommodates the contributions from principal and complementary series in the Källén-Lehmann spectral decomposition of composite operators, and leads to an inversion formula for the spectral density.

Abstract: The one-loop Euclidean partition function on the sphere is known to exhibit a nontrivial phase for massless fields of spin greater than one. Such a phase appears to be in tension with a state counting interpretation of the partition function and its relation to the de Sitter entropy. It has been recently argued that the phase associated with the gravitational path integral can be cancelled by including the contribution of an observer. In this note, we compute the total phase of Vasiliev higher spin gravity on the sphere by summing over the contributions of all spins. We evaluate the resulting infinite sum using two different regularization schemes, obtaining consistent results. We find that for the non-minimal Vasiliev theory, which includes massless fields of all integer spins, the total phase vanishes in all dimensions. This result suggests that the sphere partition function of these theories may be consistent with a counting interpretation, without explicitly including an observer.

Abstract: Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moiré TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.

Abstract: Orbital magnetism is a purely quantum phenomenon that reflects intrinsic electronic properties of solids, yet its microscopic description in interacting multiband systems remains incomplete. We develop a general quantum many-body framework for orbital magnetic responses based on the Luttinger-Ward functional. Starting from the Dyson equation, we reformulate the thermodynamic potential in a weak magnetic field and construct a controlled expansion in powers of $B$ applicable to correlated electron systems. A key technical advance is a modified ``Fourier'' representation using noncommutative coordinates, which allows the thermodynamic potential to be expressed in an effective momentum space where the magnetic field acts perturbatively. This formulation makes analytic progress possible within the Moyal algebra. As an application, we derive the spontaneous orbital magnetization and express it entirely in terms of the zero-field Hamiltonian renormalized by the self-energy. For frequency-dependent but Hermitian self-energies, we generalize the orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvature to momentum-frequency space and identify two gauge-invariant contributions built from these quantities. For frequency-independent self-energies the result reduces to the familiar geometric formula for noninteracting systems. This framework provides a unified foundation for computing orbital magnetic responses in correlated multiband materials.

Conclusion: This work provides a detailed analysis of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model under an external magnetic field, contributing to the understanding of quantum phase transitions and magnetocaloric effects in frustrated systems.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature properties of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We focus on the highly frustrated regime around $J_2 \approx J_1/2$. The $h$-$T$ phase diagram is investigated with particular emphasis on the finite-temperature transition into the "up-up-up-down" state that is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations and manifests itself as a plateau at one half of the saturation magnetization in the quantum case. We also discuss the enhanced magnetocaloric effect associated to the ground-state degeneracy that arises at the saturation field for $J_2=J_1/2$. For reference, we first study the classical case by classical Monte Carlo simulations. Then we turn to the extreme quantum limit of spin-1/2 where we perform zero- and finite-temperature Lanczos calculations.

Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) describes direct, non-fine-tuned quantum phase transition between two ordered phases that break distinct and seemingly unrelated symmetries, providing a route to continuous phase transition beyond the conventional Ginzburg--Landau paradigm. In this work we extend the DQCP paradigm to systems with internal supersymmetry (SUSY), where the on-site Hilbert space furnishes a representation of a Lie superalgebra, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the corresponding Lie supergroup. Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior. Finally, we show that explicitly breaking $OSp(1|2)$ down to $SU(2)$ continuously connects our sDQCP to the conventional DQCP scenario.

Abstract: CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly identified strongly correlated kagome superconductor, characterized by non-Fermi-liquid behavior at elevated temperatures and intertwined charge- and spin-density-wave order below $T_{DW}\approx 54$K. Under external pressure, this order is suppressed and a superconducting phase emerges. This phase diagram, which closely resembles that of high-$T_c$ superconductors, together with a kagome flat band near the Fermi level and possible altermagnetic order, has motivated extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. To better understand how pressure influences the ordered states, we present a systematic study of the evolution of the electronic properties under applied pressure. Performing DFT+DMFT (density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory) calculations, we uncover a complex interplay between the redistribution of spectral weight in the flat bands and the strength of electronic correlations under pressure. Our results further strengthen the interpretation that pressure effectively weakens electronic correlations through enhanced orbital hybridization. This, in turn, strongly suggests that superconductivity emerges as a direct consequence of the suppression of the system's ordered phase.

Abstract: We study Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions for triangular-lattice U(1) Dirac spin liquids in a Zeeman field, where we allow the U(1) gauge field to develop a gauge flux, resulting in (spin-split) spinon Landau levels. We find that at a given magnetization, the optimal candidate state has a finite flux chosen such that the spinon filling lies in a $|C|=1$ Landau-level gap: it gives the lowest variational energy and the smallest energy variance within our correlation-matrix reconstruction for local Heisenberg-type models. By symmetry, we argue that the finite gauge flux results in a non-zero (staggered) scalar spin chirality, as also numerically observed, and further find that the $|C|=1$ state exhibits dominant quasi-long-ranged $120^\circ$ magnetic correlations. Studying the next-to-optimal wavefunction with a $|C|=2$ Landau-level gap, we observe unusual spin-nematic correlations. Our results may provide guidance for analyzing the magnetic-field response of DSL candidate materials and offer numerical diagnostics that can connect to the underlying theory of spinons coupled to an emergent U(1) gauge field.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host a variety of fractionalized particles. In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit. We connect these field-induced dynamical phenomena to concrete experimental observables, relevant for neutron scattering, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and pump-probe spectroscopy that are capable of resolving specific types of fractionalized particles, including Majoranas and $Z_2$ fluxes.

Abstract: Within the Hubbard model, the ionization energy and electron affinity of the icosahedral C60 fullerene are calculated in the static fluctuation approximation. A graphical representation of the chemical potential equation is first obtained. The correlation function, which describes the transitions of π-electrons from one fullerene site to the nearest site, and the thermodynamic average, which characterizes the probability of detecting two π-electrons with oppositely oriented spin projections on a single fullerene site, are then calculated. The theoretically obtained values for the ionization energy of 7.57 eV and the electron affinity of 2.67 eV coincide with the experimentally observed values and demonstrate that, during photoionization or another process leading to either the acquisition or loss of a π-electron, the fullerene responds to external perturbations as a single system of strongly correlated π-electrons.

Abstract: Altermagnets are metals with a momentum-dependent spin splitting of electron bands due to a specific crystal structure, which is invariant under time reversal only in combination with rotations and reflections. The developed phenomenological approach makes it possible to obtain a spectrum of electron bands in an altermagnet corresponding to an antiferromagnet with the same symmetry. The anomalous Hall effect is an inherent property of substances whose electron band dispersion is characterized by the Berry curvature. Calculations of the Berry curvature were performed for altermagnet analogs of collinear antiferromagnet, weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnet, and ferrimagnetic structures. It was shown that in the specific cases under consideration, the anomalous Hall effect in the absence of an external magnetic field is possible only in the state of a weak ferromagnet.

*M. S. Laad,Prosenjit Haldar*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A Bethe lattice-based analytic theory for the Mott-like quantum criticality in the FK model shows that as temperature approaches zero, a weakly ergodic metal transitions to a non-ergodic insulator, with density fluctuations exhibiting anomalous dimensions through sub-diffusive behavior. At zero temperature, the system shrinks to a quantum critical point without a conventional gap opening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is motivated by the challenge of developing a fully analytic theory for Mott-like QCP in the FK model, which has been extensively studied numerically but lacks a clear microscopic understanding. The work focuses on a hierarchical Cayley tree (Bethe lattice) and employs a single input from a 2-site cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT).

Method: The study builds on previous methods for the FK model on a Bethe lattice, incorporating tools from dynamical mean-field theory and dynamical renormalization groups with a focus on zero-temperature physics. By using only the output of a 2-site cluster-CMFT, the researchers achieve a self-contained analytic description of the quantum criticality, particularly key for understanding a quantum critical point in infinite-dimensional systems with no conventional band structure.

Result: The main finding is the presence of a quantum critical point at zero temperature without conventional band structure, where the Fermi surface argument breaks down. The critical behavior is driven by non-Fermi liquid physics, with density fluctuations acquiring anomalous dimensions through sub-diffusive behavior arising from infrared power-law cluster self-energies. At finite temperatures, the system exhibits a crossover between the Erdos metal and non-ergodic insulator phases. The critical point separates these two phases, and the Fermi surface argument cannot describe the critical behavior at T=0.

Conclusion: This work fills a long-standing gap in the theory of the FK model. It provides a simple yet comprehensive analytic theory of the Mott-like QCP on the Bethe lattice, highlights non-Fermi physics at zero temperature, and reveals strong finite-temperature precursor quantum phases. The results suggest that the Mott-like QCP may generically exist even if conventional band structure approaches are unavailable, opening the door for applying non-Fermi liquid concepts to highly frustrated and disordered systems.

Abstract: The Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) is long known to be the simplest model of correlated fermions exhibiting a novel Mott-like quantum critical point (QCP) assocaited with a {\it continuous} MIT in dimensions $D \geq 3$. It is also known to be isomorphic to an {\it annealed} binary-alloy disorder model. Notwithstanding extensive numerical studies for the FKM, analytic insight into the microscopic processes spawning novel Mott-like quantum criticality is scarce. Here, we develop a fully analytic theory for the Mott-like quantum criticality in the FKM on a hierarchical Cayley tree (Bethe lattice) by utilizing a single input from a 2-site cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). We find that density fluctuation modes acquire anomalous dimensions, originating from infra-red power-law singular cluster self-energies. Interestingly, we uncover, at $T=0$, that this {\it sub-diffusive} metal with glassy dynamics separating a weakly ergodic metal from a non-ergodic insulator shrinks to a single point, namely the Mott-like QCP, at least on the Bethe lattice. We detail the consequences of this anomalous quantum criticality for a range of thermal and dynamical responses in a variety of physical systems that can be effectively modelled by the FKM.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fidelity of orbital optimization in variational Monte Carlo to improve diffusion Monte Carlo results on correlated magnetic systems, using CrSBr as a model system. We compare the performance of different optimization methods, showing that stochastic reconfiguration is a robust and reliable optimizer. We show that short range Jastrow factors are important for improving diffusion Monte Carlo, regardless of the quality of orbitals. Large active spaces are required to converge the variational energy, but ulitmately orbital optimization produces worse diffusion Monte Carlo energies when compared to standard orbitals from density functional theory. We show that this increased bias is due to larger locality errors from the use of pseudopotentials, while the fixed-node error is actually improved by using orbital optimization. Additionally, for observables other than energy, orbital optimization produces a systematically smaller mixed-estimator bias. Ultimately, we believe orbital optimization provides a reliable method to improve variational and pure fixed-node energies as well as lower mixed-estimator bias.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that transient Pauli blocking can induce ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films without significant carrier injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrafast optical switching is crucial for next-generation communication and computing technologies, and this paper explores a promising mechanism using Pauli blocking in semiconductors.

Method: The research employs pump-probe transient transmittance measurements and probe-energy-resolved analysis to study ultrafast dynamics, supported by a theoretical model based on Fermi-Dirac distribution.

Result: The model successfully captures experimental transients, determining the electron-phonon coupling constant and electronic specific heat coefficient, which enable prediction of the spectral switching window. Importantly, ultrafast optical switching is achieved through a rise in electronic temperature caused by laser excitation, without significant carrier injection.

Conclusion: This work offers new insights into designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for advanced communication and computing technologies.

Abstract: The transient Pauli blocking effect offers a promising route for achieving ultrafast optical switching in semiconductors, enabling a rapid switching from an initially opaque state to a relatively transparent state upon photoexcitation. Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution. The model successfully captures the experimental transients and yields an electron-phonon coupling constant of $1.0\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-3}\,K^{-1}}$, along with an electronic specific heat coefficient ranging from 1.52 to 2.02 $\mathrm{mJ\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-2}}$, which allow direct prediction of the spectral switching window. Notably, we demonstrate that the Pauli blocking effect can be induced solely by a laser-excitation driven rise in electronic temperature, without requiring significant carrier injection into the conduction band in degenerate semiconductors. These findings offer new insights for designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for next-generation communication and computing technologies.

Abstract: The drastic increase of bandwidth demands in AI datacenters requires new solutions with low power consumption and high bandwidth densities. Further increasing the total bandwidth with copper interconnects is challenging, thus it is crucial to introduce optics into the scale-up network. For this purpose, the most important metrics are the energy efficiency of the total link in addition to the spatial bandwidth-density and reach. With the inefficiency of copper traces at high speeds, transitioning to co-packaged optics is no longer optional but essential. Here, we show that the mature VCSEL technology offers the ideal combination of low-cost, low-latency, high-reliability, and energy efficiency at all bitrates, thanks to their unique versatility and high wall-plug-efficiency.

TL;DR:  paper proposes using Bayesian optimization to design a plasma-based device, resulting in highly efficient EM wave manipulation. The results show significant performance improvements compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: there is a need for efficient and robust methodologies for designing electromagnetic devices, particularly in scenarios involving complex, high-dimensional systems with noise.

Method: Bayesian optimization is applied to tune a plasma-based metamaterial device by adjusting 91 independent plasma parameters to optimize EM wave transmission. The optimization is done in situ, using an automated loop with vector network analyzers to measure scattering parameters.

Result:  successful demonstration of in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x better isolation between device ports compared to traditional simulation-based methods, highlighting the method's robustness even with experimental noise.

Conclusion:  Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for optimizing complex plasma-based devices with high-dimensional parameter spaces and noisy measurements. The success in this application opens new possibilities for in-situ, gradient-free optimization in EM device design.

Abstract: Inverse design is a commonly used methodology for creating devices that manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves by algorithmically modifying device parameters to achieve a desired functionality. Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting. By relying only on measured scattering parameters, this gradient-free approach is robust to experimental drift and noise and does not require complex full-wave models. Significant performance improvements over traditional simulation-based (in-silico) inverse design are demonstrated, with in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x higher isolation between ports than the best in-silico design at the same target frequency. This work also presents guidelines for applying Bayesian optimization to noisy, high-dimensional physical systems.

Abstract: Integrated quantum photonics holds significant promise for scalable photonic quantum information processing, quantum repeaters, and quantum networks, but its development is hindered by the mismatch between materials hosting high-quality quantum emitters and those compatible with mature photonic technologies. Heterogeneous integration offers a potential solution to this challenge, yet practical implementations have been limited by inevitable insertion losses at material interfaces. Here, we present a self-aligned heterogeneous quantum photonic integration approach that can deterministically achieve near-unity coupling efficiency at the interface. To showcase our approach, we demonstrate Purcell enhancement of a silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond induced by a heterogeneous photonic crystal cavity defined by titanium dioxide (TiO2), as well as optical spin control and readout via a TiO2 photonic circuit. We further show that, when combined with inverse photonic design, our approach enables efficient and broadband collection of single photons from a color center into a heterogeneous waveguide. Our approach is not restricted to SiV centers or TiO2; it can be broadly applied to integrate diverse solid-state quantum emitters with thin-film photonic devices where conformal deposition is possible. Together, these results establish a practical route to scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits that combine high-quality quantum emitters with technologically mature photonic platforms.

Conclusion:  the research provides a comprehensive understanding of Kerr-enhanced three-wave mixing amplification in integrated optical microresonators with dual non-linearities, offering new insights into optimizing photonics and quantum devices.

Abstract: Integrated optical microresonators exploiting either second-order ($χ^{(2)}$) or third-order ($χ^{(3)}$) nonlinearities have become key platforms for frequency conversion, low-noise microwave photonics, and quantum entanglement generation. Here, we present an analytic theory of Kerr-enhanced three-wave mixing amplification in an electro-optic microresonator with both $χ^{(2)}$ and $χ^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate that Kerr dressing hybridizes the optical sidebands, renormalizing the $χ^{(2)}$ couplings and detunings. As a result the system exhibits gain in regions where analogous bare $χ^{(2)}$ or $χ^{(3)}$ amplifiers are subthreshold. Time-domain Langevin simulations confirm this threshold reduction, mapping a practical design window for experiments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) has been very widely employed for phase retrieval. In particular, the TIE is an elliptic second-order partial differential equation which may be solved for the phase of a coherent paraxial field such as a monochromatic scalar optical beam, given the intensity and longitudinal intensity derivative in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis. We show how the coherent flow associated with the TIE may be augmented by a diffusive flow associated with a scalar or tensor diffusion field. Such diffusive flow can arise via scattering from unresolved spatially random microstructure within an illuminated sample, the blurring effects of an extended chaotic source that illuminates the sample, the resolution-reducing effect of shot noise in detected intensity images of the sample, and the sharpening effect (negative diffusion) associated with scattering from sharp sample edges. Augmenting the TIE's modeling of coherent flow with a diffuse-flow channel leads to a Fokker-Planck extension to this equation. Two different TIE augmentations are obtained, using three different derivations. The inverse problems of phase retrieval and diffusion-field retrieval are then studied, for both defocus-based imaging and mask-based imaging (structured-illumination imaging). When symmetric overfocus and underfocus images are employed for the purposes of phase retrieval, the diffusive term drops out and our Fokker-Planck formalism implies that any ensuing TIE-based phase-retrieval method needs no modification in light of our formalism. However, the same focal-series dataset -- which is typically an infocus image, a weakly overfocused image, and a weakly underfocused image -- may also be employed to access the additional channel of information associated with the Fokker-Planck diffusion field. Our formalism is applicable to visible light, x-rays, electrons, and neutrons.

Motivation: There's a need for efficient and scalable electro-optic modulators for photonic integrated circuits, which are crucial for various applications like communication networks and quantum computing.

Method: The authors employed solution-deposited BaTiO3 combined with bottom-up soft lithography for nanofabrication, improving optical properties through process optimization.

Result: Significant reduction in propagation losses (two orders of magnitude) was achieved, enabling high-efficiency electro-optic modulation, and a new cost-effective route for integrated devices was established.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for low-cost, large-scale production of efficient BaTiO3-based integrated electro-optic devices.

Abstract: Metal oxides with strong nonlinear optical properties and wide transparency window are key materials for the development of compact and efficient photonic integrated circuits used for electro-optic modulators and entangled photon sources. Among them, barium titanate (BaTiO$_{3}$) is particularly attractive due to its large Pockels coefficient. However, its use has been limited by challenges in material synthesis and in nanopatterning, owing to its chemical stability and inertness. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic electro-optic modulator entirely based on solution-deposited BaTiO$_{3}$, fabricated through a bottom-up soft nanoimprinting lithography process. Fine-tuning the synthesis and nanofabrication enhances the optical properties of the polycrystalline material. By optimizing the process parameters, we achieve a reduction in propagation losses of two orders of magnitude, enabling efficient electro-optic modulation. This scalable, etch-free approach enables direct patterning of high-quality BaTiO$_{3}$ structures, establishing a new route for low-cost, large-scale integrated electro-optic devices entirely based on oxide material compatible with a wide range of substrates.

Abstract: We highlight the correspondence between one-dimensional Lorentz transformations, which relate events observed from two distinct inertial reference frames, and ray transfer transformations in Gaussian optics. Specifically, we identify optical systems whose transfer matrices reproduce the mathematical structure of the Lorentz transformation. Within this framework, we show that fundamental effects of special relativity as time dilatation, length contraction and loss of synchronicity find a direct counterpart in the behavior of light rays deviated by a diverging lens, thereby providing a novel and illustrative optical equivalence of relativistic phenomena. This article is intended for a broad audience of physicists. The correspondence described is general and may interest students with a moderate background in special relativity and optics, as well as teachers in the corresponding fields.

Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces faces inherent challenges due to the nonlinear and highly complex relationship between geometric configurations and their electromagnetic behavior. Traditional optimization approaches often suffer from excessive computational demands and a tendency to converge to suboptimal solutions. This study presents a diffusion-based generative framework that incorporates a dedicated consistency constraint and advanced posterior sampling methods to ensure adherence to desired electromagnetic specifications. Through rigorous validation on small-scale metasurface configurations, the proposed approach demonstrates marked enhancements in both accuracy and reliability of the generated designs.Furthermore, we introduce a scalable methodology that extends inverse design capabilities to large-scale metasurfaces, validated for configurations of up to $98 \times 98$ nanopillars. Notably, this approach enables rapid design generation completed in minute by leveraging models trained on substantially smaller arrays ($23 \times 23$). These innovations establish a robust and efficient framework for high-precision metasurface inverse design.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal vortex pulses (STVPs) are wavepackets that carry transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM), whose proper quantification has been the subject of recent debate. In this work, we introduce a simplified mechanical model of STVPs, consisting of a loop of non-interacting point particles traveling at a uniform constant speed but at slightly di!erent angles. We examine di!erent initial conditions for the particle loop, including configurations that are elliptic in space at a given time and configurations that are elliptic in spacetime at a fixed propagation distance. Furthermore, employing a non-uniform mass distribution allows the particle loop to mimic the STVP not only in configuration space but also in momentum space. Remarkably, when supplemented by a semiclassical vorticity quantization condition, our mechanical model exactly reproduces di!erent wave-based OAM results previously reported for paraxial STVPs.

Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of stimulated cooling in the non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting exciton-polaritons from approximately room temperature down to 20K. By resolving the condensate in energy-momentum space and performing interferometric measurements, we distinguish the condensate from thermalized particles yet occupying excited states macroscopically. In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 065301 (2022)], we observe segmentation of the particle density along the excited states into two fractions both following Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with different effective temperatures and chemical potentials. Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.

We demonstrate that the expression obeys fundamental relations such like the f-sum rule and the detailed balance. We also reveal the hidden fermionic structure behind the correlator. In the static limit we show that it can be written in terms of universal functions which, at zero temperature, coincide with the level spacing distribution function of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. Our work provides a full and exact characterisation of a dynamic correlation function in a strongly correlated interacting quantum many-body system.

Abstract: Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.

Abstract: Recent experiments have probed the stability of ring superfluids in the presence of Josephson barriers or Gaussian impurities. Here we present a theoretical analysis that extends beyond the regimes explored so far. We study the onset of dynamical instabilities induced by a one-dimensional potential rotating at an effective angular velocity $ω$, addressing both the tunneling and the hydrodynamic regimes. We show that the critical angular velocity $ω_c$ increases almost linearly with the number of barriers, with a slope set by their height and width. When the system is quenched into the dynamically unstable regime, it emits multiple solitons, which can switch or even reverse the direction of circulation. The stabilization mechanism is robust against imperfections of the potential and does not require a perfectly periodic array of barriers. In particular, we find that adding a disordered speckle potential to an ordered array of barriers can further increase $ω_c$: disorder can therefore make a ring superfluid more resilient to dynamical instabilities.

Abstract: We analyze the WAHUHA Floquet protocol recently applied to arrays of Rydberg atoms and derive beyond-leading-order corrections in the high-frequency expansion of the effective spin theory. We find that an appropriate choice of the pulses times can enforce an approximate symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the total magnetization. The interaction channels emerging from higher-order Floquet terms affect three-body bound states (\emph{trimers}), which gain a significant mobility. We estimate the corresponding enhancement in 1D spin chains and conclude that their dynamics is within experimental reach. Detrimental effects due to the proliferation of particles outside of the trimer magnetization sector are found to occur and spread on time-scales slower than the trimer propagation. Moreover, these can be suppressed in higher dimensional lattices, e.g. in 2D triangular lattices, as the lattice geometry brings these processes off resonance. Our results establish a concrete route to realizing mobile multiparticle bound states in Floquet-engineered Rydberg platforms.

### [70] [Light propagation in atomic stratified media: breakdown of the transfer-matrix method at high density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14715)
*Igor M. Sokolov,William Guerin*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The transfer-matrix method is reliable for low-atom density in 1D optical lattices but fails beyond a certain density due to collective atomic responses. This method is important for quantum/photonic simulations in cold-atom technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research into ultra-cold atoms and their quantum/photonic properties, particularly in 1D optical lattices, is significant for both fundamental physics and potential technological applications. The transfer-matrix method is a widely-used tool in such studies, but its validity limits are crucial to identify for accurate modeling and experiment design.

Method: The study involves comparing the transfer-matrix method's results with the exact microscopic coupled-dipole model, focusing on linear-optics regime performance. Analysis includes examining system behavior under varying atomic densities to determine method applicability.

Result: The transfer-matrix method performs well at low densities but breaks down at higher densities due to non-local, collective atomic interactions. This extends our understanding of method limitations in modeling disordered systems.

Conclusion: This work establishes the boundaries of the transfer-matrix method in modeling 1D cold-atom systems, highlighting its applicability range and guiding future experimental realizations in ultra-cold atom physics.

Abstract: The transfer-matrix method is a standard approach to wave propagation in stratified media. With the advent of cold-atom-based quantum and photonic technologies, several experiments and many proposals consider light propagation in one-dimensional optical lattices, using the transfer matrices as the main tool for the simulation. Here, we study the validity of this method by comparing its results to the microscopic coupled-dipole model, which is exact in the linear-optics regime. We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others. We determine the boundary values of atomic densities for which this method is still applicable for describing experiments. Our findings are relevant for experimental realizations using ultra-cold atoms.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rapidly advancing field of research, revealing a range of novel phenomena and potential applications. Traditional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically simulated by constructing asymmetric couplings or by introducing dissipation and gain to realize non-Hermitian systems. The quadratic bosonic system (QBS) with squeezing interaction is intrinsically Hermitian; however, its dynamical evolution matrix in both real and momentum spaces is non-Hermitian. Based on this, applying a field-operator transformation xp to the dynamical evolution matrix yields quadrature nonreciprocal transmission between the x and p operators. This nonreciprocal characteristic can be utilized in signal amplifiers. On the other hand, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in momentum space, one can observe non-Hermitian topological phenomena such as point-gap topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect, both induced by spectra with nonzero winding numbers. Additionally, QBS can be employed to realize non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm cages and to extend non-Bloch band theory. Previous studies in non-Hermitian physics have largely concentrated on classical systems. The influence of non-Hermitian properties on quantum effects remains a key issue awaiting exploration and has evolved into a research direction at the interface of non-Hermitian and quantum physics.

*Corentin Lanore,Xavier Valcarce,Jean Etesse,Anthony Martin,Jean-Daniel Bancal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the feasibility of implementing Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (DIQKD) on a photonic circuit recently identified by machine learning techniques. While DIQKD offers enhanced security compared to traditional QKD protocols, it typically requires higher noise tolerance which has limited its experimental implementation. The authors propose an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that takes into account full outcome statistics. Their analysis suggests that the proposed photonic circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work stems from the ongoing quest to overcome the limitations of traditional QKD protocols and enhance the security of quantum communication systems. As quantum internet becomes increasingly viable, there's a pressing need for robust and practical QKD protocols that can operate under realistic conditions.

Method: The authors employ a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental simulation to assess the feasibility of implementing DIQKD on a photonic circuit. Specifically, they introduce an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that considers full outcome statistics. They also leverage machine learning techniques to identify a photonic circuit that is suitable for DIQKD implementation.

Result: The key result of this work is the demonstration that the proposed photonic circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization feasible. The authors' numerical experiments suggest that the proposed implementation can achieve a secret key rate of around 0.1 per sifted photon under realistic noise conditions.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper makes a significant step towards the practical implementation of DIQKD by demonstrating the feasibility of its application to a photonic circuit. The authors' findings open up new possibilities for the development of robust and scalable quantum communication systems.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols enable two distant parties to communicate with information-theoretically proven secrecy. However, these protocols are generally vulnerable to potential mismatches between the physical modeling and the implementation of their quantum operations, thereby opening opportunities for side channel attacks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD addresses this problem by reducing the degree of device modeling to a black-box setting. The stronger security obtained in this way comes at the cost of a reduced noise tolerance, rendering experimental demonstrations more challenging: so far, only one experiment based on trapped ions was able to successfully generate a secret key. Photonic platforms have however long been preferred for QKD thanks to their suitability to optical fiber transmission, high repetition rates, readily available hardware, and potential for circuit integration. In this work, we assess the feasibility of DIQKD on a photonic circuit recently identified by machine learning techniques. For this, we introduce an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that takes into account full outcome statistics. Our analysis shows that the proposed optical circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization realistic.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of circuits composed of stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates. This type of dynamics arises from quantum circuits with random controlled gates, as well as in stochastic circuits and deterministic classical cellular automata. We prove that stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates lead to two-point spatio-temporal correlation functions that vanish everywhere except when the two operators act on the same site. More generally, for multi-point correlations the two rightmost operators must act on the same site. We argue that autocorrelation, while hard to compute, typically decays exponentially towards a value that is exponentially small in the system size. Our results reveal a broad class of quantum systems that exhibit surprisingly simple correlation structures despite their complex microscopic dynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.

Abstract: We extend the Pauli Propagation framework to simulate imaginary time evolution. By deriving explicit update rules for the propagation of Pauli operators under imaginary time evolution generated by Pauli strings, we introduce an imaginary time Pauli Propagation (ITPP) algorithm for approximating imaginary time dynamics directly in the Pauli basis. This approach enables the computation of thermal and ground-state properties while retaining the key computational advantages of Pauli Propagation. Benchmarking ITPP on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model demonstrates that truncation provides a controlled trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, while also revealing challenges associated with operator growth under imaginary time evolution. Finally, combining imaginary time and real-time Pauli Propagation naturally suggests a pathway toward simulating open quantum system dynamics within a unified framework.

Motivation: This paper advances quantum state differentiation using multiple copies.

Method: Proved that excluding is possible with ≥3 states and any number of copies.

Result: State exclusion becomes feasible with multiple copies.

Conclusion: Applying multiple copies makes state exclusion possible.

Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is the task of identifying at least one state from a known set that was not used in the preparation of a quantum system. In particular, a given set of quantum states is said to admit state exclusion if there exists a measurement such that, for each state in the set, some measurement outcome rules it out with certainty. However, state exclusion is not always possible in the single-copy setting. In this paper, we investigate whether access to multiple identical copies enables state exclusion. We prove that for any set of three or more pure states, state exclusion becomes possible with a finite number of copies. We further show that the required number of copies may be arbitrarily large -- in particular, for every natural number $N$, we construct sets of states for which exclusion remains impossible with $N$ or fewer copies.

Conclusion: 研究为结合量子机器学习与超分辨率重建提供新方向。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) seeks to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) data from low-resolution (LR) observations. Classical deep learning methods have advanced SR substantially, but require increasingly deeper networks, large datasets, and heavy computation to capture fine-grained correlations. In this work, we present the \emph{first study} to investigate quantum circuits for SR. We propose a framework based on Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with \emph{Adaptive Non-Local Observable} (ANO) measurements. Unlike conventional VQCs with fixed Pauli readouts, ANO introduces trainable multi-qubit Hermitian observables, allowing the measurement process to adapt during training. This design leverages the high-dimensional Hilbert space of quantum systems and the representational structure provided by entanglement and superposition. Experiments demonstrate that ANO-VQCs achieve up to five-fold higher resolution with a relatively small model size, suggesting a promising new direction at the intersection of quantum machine learning and super-resolution.

Abstract: We present QDK/Chemistry, a software toolkit for quantum chemistry workflows targeting quantum computers. The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native implementations of targeted algorithms in the quantum-classical pipeline, the toolkit builds upon and integrates with widely used open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks through a plugin system, allowing users to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic. This paper describes the design philosophy, current capabilities, and role of QDK/Chemistry as a foundation for reproducible quantum chemistry experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the fidelity of quantum gates is crucial for scalable quantum computing, addressing the bottleneck of control line interference.

Method: Active interference suppression employing off-resonant tones and optimized frequency allocation were used to mitigate degradation under the rotating wave approximation.

Result: Incorporating orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal tones decreases gate infidelity proportionally to 1/N², improving gate performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates issues in frequency-division-multiplexed gate operations, paving the way for scalable quantum computing.

Abstract: An increase in the number of control lines between the quantum processors and the external electronics constitutes a major bottleneck in the realization of large-scale quantum computers. Frequency-division multiplexing is expected to enable multiple qubits to be controlled through a single microwave cable; however, interference from off-resonant microwave tones hinders precise qubit control. Here, we propose an active interference suppression method for frequency-division-multiplexed simultaneous gate operations. We demonstrate that deliberate incorporation of off-resonant microwave tones improves the accuracy of single-qubit gates. Specifically, we find that by incorporating off-resonant orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal microwave tones, the gate infidelity decreases proportionally to the inverse square of the number of microwave tones. Furthermore, we show that fast oscillations neglected under the rotating wave approximation degrade gate fidelity, and that this degradation can be mitigated through optimized frequency allocation. Our approach is simple yet effective for improving the performance of frequency-division-multiplexed quantum gates.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how multi-mode fibers can be used to perform generalized measurements of high-dimensional time-bin superpositions, offering a scalable solution compared to traditional interferometers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome the scalability issues in traditional methods for measuring large and complex quantum superpositions of photon arrival times, which is crucial for advancing quantum technologies such as quantum computing and key distribution.

Method: The method involves utilizing the multi-spectral transmission matrix of a single multi-mode fiber to couple spatial and temporal information. This allows the creation of spatial modes with distinct dispersive delays, which are then used to engineer a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits.

Result: The implementation enables measurements of time-bin superpositions up to dimension 11, which is a significant improvement over conventional methods that scale poorly with dimension. This provides a powerful tool for quantum technologies requiring precise temporal control of photons.

Conclusion: This breakthrough simplifies the experimental setup for generalized quantum measurements, paving the way for practical applications in quantum computing and ultra-secure communication technologies.

Abstract: The temporal degree-of-freedom of light is incredibly powerful for modern quantum technologies, enabling large-scale quantum computing architectures and record key-rates in quantum key distribution. However, the generalized measurement of large and complex quantum superpositions of the time-of-arrival of a photon remains a unique experimental challenge. Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization. In addition, these are limited by construction to a restricted set of phase-only superposition measurements. Here we show how the coupling of spatial and temporal information inside a single multi-mode fiber can be harnessed to program completely generalized measurements for high-dimensional superpositions of photonic time-bin. Using the multi-spectral transmission matrix of the fiber, we find special sets of spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays through the fiber. By exciting coherent superpositions of these spatial modes, we engineer the equivalent of large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber and use them to perform high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions in up to dimension 11. The single fiber functions as a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits that significantly eases the experimental overheads of standard approaches based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers, serving as an essential tool for quantum technologies that harness the temporal properties of light.

Conclusion: 量子叠加的实现依赖明确的相位条件，类似于困境问题，对于门限计算和量子计算有潜在影响。

Abstract: Quantum superposition is often phrased as the ability to add state vectors. In practice, however, the physical quantity is a ray (a rank-one projector), so each input specifies only a projector and leaves a gauge freedom in the phases of its vector representatives. This becomes a real operational barrier when one asks for a device that, given two independently prepared unknown pure states, outputs a coherent state proportional to a prescribed linear combination. We identify the missing ingredient as not probabilistic but phase-like. One needs a physical scenario that fixes a single phase convention on the relevant set of rays, so that the overlaps become well defined complex numbers. Thus, we formalize this through phase conventions and a single notion -- dubbed as "overlap-determinability." Our main theorem gives an exact equivalence: A nonzero completely positive trace-nonincreasing map that probabilistically produces superposition on a domain exists if and only if that domain is overlap-determinable. This unifies modern no-superposition results and characterizes the exceptional yes-go protocols, which succeed precisely when side information supplies the required missing resource. We then show that granting universal access to such convention-fixed overlaps destabilizes the familiar foundational and computational constraints. It enables forbidden transformations akin to quantum cloning and yields super-luminal signaling. It would also permit reflections about unknown states, leading to exponentially fast overlap amplification and a collapse of Grover's search lower bound to a logarithmic query complexity.

Abstract: Sensing networks underpin applications from fundamental physics to real-world engineering. Recently, distributed quantum sensing (DQS) has been investigated to boost the sensing performance, yet current schemes typically rely on entangled probes that are fragile to noise and difficult to scale. Here, we propose a DQS protocol that incorporates a causal-order switch into a cyclic network, enabling a single probe to sequentially query N independent sensors in a coherent superposition or a probabilistic mixture of opposite causal orders. By exploiting the noncommutativity between propagation and sensing processes, our scheme achieves a 1/N^2-scaling precision limit without involving entangled probes. Importantly, our approach utilizes a classical mixture of causal orders rather than a quantum switch, making it more feasible for practical realization. We experimentally implement this scheme for distributed beam tilts sensing in a free-space quantum optical network comprising up to 9 sensors, achieving picoradian-scale precision in estimating tilt angle. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable DQS protocol that surpasses the conventional 1/N Heisenberg scaling in precision, advancing the practical deployment of quantum sensing networks.

### [85] [Adaptive Fidelity Estimation for Quantum Programs with Graph-Guided Noise Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14713)
*Tingting Li,Ziming Zhao,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QuFid is a framework for estimating quantum program fidelity on NISQ devices by adaptive measurement allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fidelity estimation is important but costly, so efficiently allocating measurements is needed.

Method: QuFid models quantum programs as DAGs using control-flow-aware random walks to model noise, then derives a noise-propagation operator from transpilation effects. It uses spectral characteristics to plan measurements.

Result: QuFid reduces measurement costs by factors of 1.5–3x compared to other methods while maintaining good fidelity.

Conclusion: Adaptive, noise-aware measurement allocation is crucial for efficient quantum program verification on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Fidelity estimation is a critical yet resource-intensive step in testing quantum programs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where the required number of measurements is difficult to predefine due to hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and transpilation-induced circuit transformations. We present QuFid, an adaptive and noise-aware framework that determines measurement budgets online by leveraging circuit structure and runtime statistical feedback. QuFid models a quantum program as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and employs a control-flow-aware random walk to characterize noise propagation along gate dependencies. Backend-specific effects are captured via transpilation-induced structural deformation metrics, which are integrated into the random-walk formulation to induce a noise-propagation operator. Circuit complexity is then quantified through the spectral characteristics of this operator, providing a principled and lightweight basis for adaptive measurement planning. Experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Quantum backends show that QuFid significantly reduces measurement cost compared to fixed-shot and learning-based baselines, while consistently maintaining acceptable fidelity bias.

Abstract: We compare different circuits implementing distributed versions of quantum computations, using entangled pairs only, and using distributed fan-out operations (using GHZ states). We highlight the advantages of using distributed fan-out operations in terms of reductions in circuit depth and (possibly) entanglement resources. We note that distributed fan-out operations (or notably, distributed GHZ states) could be a ``primitive'' building block for distributed quantum operations in the same way as entangled pairs are, if distributed GHZ states could be realized efficiently.

Conclusion: SU(2)-不变张量的纠缠性显著低于通用张量，其分布特征与通用张量存在明显差异，尤其是在纠缠峰值位置。

Abstract: The space $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ of SU(2)-invariant four-valent tensors, also known as intertwiners, can be understood as the quantum states of a tetrahedron in Euclidean space with fixed areas. In loop quantum gravity, they are states of the smallest "atom of space" with non-zero volume. At the same time they correspond to four-party tensor product states invariant under global rotations. We consider the multipartite entanglement of states in $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ using the recently proposed entropic fill.
  Numerically evaluating entropic fill in the case of equal spins between $1/2$ and $11$, we find that the distributions of entanglement are very different for intertwiners as compared to generic tensors, and for coherent intertwiners as compared to generic ones. The peak in the distribution seems to be at the highest entanglement for generic intertwiners and at the lowest for generic tensors, but in terms of average entanglement, the roles are switched: average entanglement is highest in arbitrary tensors and lower in intertwiners, at least in the regime of large $j$. We also find that entanglement depends on the geometric data of coherent intertwiners in a complicated way.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We developed a blended dynamics framework for complex open quantum networks, examining how qubits interact through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and diffusive interactions. The framework reveals classical-like clustering behaviors in quantum systems, and numerical simulations support our theoretical findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of complex quantum systems, especially those with multiple interacting components, is a critical challenge in modern quantum physics. This paper aims to provide a new theoretical framework to analyze such systems.

Method: We extended the classical blended dynamics theory to quantum systems by considering reduced-state dynamics, quantum Laplacians, and induced graphs. We also employed numerical methods to validate our theoretical results.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrated that classical-like clustering phenomena exist in quantum networks. The quantum blended reduced-state dynamics lead to specific convergence patterns, and numerical examples confirmed the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: This research contributes to our understanding of quantum network dynamics and provides a new analytical tool for studying complex quantum systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a blended dynamics framework for open quantum networks with diffusive couplings. The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to blend the local dynamics rather than the trajectories of individual nodes. Perturbation analysis then shows that, under sufficiently strong coupling, all node trajectories tend to stay close to those of the blended system over time. We first show that this theory extends naturally to the reduced-state dynamics of quantum networks, revealing classical-like clustering phenomena in which qubits converge to a shared equilibrium or a common trajectory determined by the quantum blended reduced-state dynamics. We then extend the analysis to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs, proving orbit attraction of the network density operator toward the quantum blended coherent dynamics, establishing the emergence of intrinsically quantum and dynamically clustering behaviors. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results.

Abstract: Understanding the thermal behavior of quantum many-body pure states is one of the most fundamental issues in quantum thermodynamics. It is widely known that typical pure states yield vanishing work, just as thermal states do, when one restricts to local operations that cannot access correlations among subsystems. However, it remains unclear whether this equivalence to thermal states persists under LOCC (local operations and classical communication), where classically accessible correlations can be exploited for work extraction. In this work, we establish criteria for determining whether many-body pure states remain equivalent to thermal states even under LOCC, and show that this thermal equivalence is governed by their multipartite quantum correlation structure. We show that states with asymptotically maximal multipartite entanglement, such as Haar-random states, cannot yield extensive work under LOCC, whereas some states with limited multipartite entanglement, such as constant-degree graph states, allow extensive work extraction despite being locally indistinguishable from thermal states. Thus, our work provides a refined operational notion of thermal equivalence beyond the traditional local regime, which is becoming increasingly important due to the recent expansion of experimentally accessible operations.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Mollow triplet is the definitive spectral signature of an optically dressed quantum emitter. We predict that for emitters coupled to localized phonons, this signature is not confined to the zero-phonon line. Under a strong resonant drive, we show that Mollow triplets are strikingly replicated on the associated phonon sidebands -a surprising result, given that phonon sidebands are typically viewed as incoherent, inelastic scattering pathways. These vibronic Mollow triplets are a direct fingerprint of dynamically generated dressed states that hybridize the emitter's electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. We develop a scalable analytical formalism to model this effect in complex, multi-mode molecular systems, such as dibenzoterrylene. Our work provides the precise driving conditions for observing these novel spectral features, establishing a new signature of coherence in vibronically coupled systems.

Conclusion: 通过调控光子环境增强发射率振荡，可以开发高效 LED 等光电子器件。

Abstract: Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linear optical gain. However, spontaneous emission is not a fundamental property of the emitter. By engineering metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters into microcavities coupled to patch antennas, we have demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting a collimated beam with excellent spatial properties and a factor 100 increase in the collected power, compared to standard devices. Our results illustrate that by reshaping the photonic environment around emitting dipoles, as in the Purcell effect, it is possible to enhance the spontaneous emission and conceive efficient optoelectronic light emitting devices that operate close to the thermodynamical equilibrium as LEDs in the visible range.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores nonlocal light-matter interactions involving giant atoms in high-dimensional environments, highlighting their potential for quantum network development and entangled state engineering. By examining nonperturbative collective dynamics within a two-dimensional photonic reservoir using a resolvent operator approach, the study uncovers unconventional quantum dynamics such as non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in the continuum, offering a platform for two-dimensional quantum memory. The research also reveals phenomena like exotic photon emission patterns and precise control over emission directions through phase engineering, which enhances the efficiency of light-matter interactions. Additionally, the findings suggest that coherent dipole-dipole interactions can persist even in the presence of a continuum of modes, challenging conventional perspectives on decoherence.

Motivation: Understanding and controlling light-matter interactions in high-dimensional environments is crucial for advancing quantum technologies such as quantum networks and quantum memory.

Result: The research uncovers non-Markovianity-induced beats, long-lived bound states in the continuum, and phenomena like exotic photon emission patterns with precise control over emission directions and coherent dipole-dipole interactions in high-dimensional environments.

Conclusion: This work provides a versatile platform for implementing two-dimensional quantum memory and challenges conventional perspectives on decoherence by demonstrating persistent coherent dipole-dipole interactions in high-dimensional environments.

Abstract: Nonlocal light-matter interactions with giant atoms in high-dimensional environments are not only fundamentally intriguing for testing quantum electrodynamics beyond the dipole approximation but also crucial for building high-dimensional quantum networks and engineering multipartite entangled states. Given the enigmatic and largely uncharted collective signatures exhibited by multiple giant atoms within two-dimensional optical baths, we delve into their nonperturbative collective dynamics within the single-excitation subspace, focusing on the case where they are coupled to a common two-dimensional photonic reservoir and employing a resolvent operator approach. We demonstrate that precisely engineered atomic arrangements lead to unconventional quantum dynamics, featuring non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in the continuum, thereby providing a versatile platform for implementing two-dimensional quantum memory. Phenomenologically, we observe the emergence of exotic photon emission patterns in both two- and three-dimensional (3D) baths. The emission directions are shown to be precisely controllable on demand through exact phase engineering of the coupling parameters, enabling a highly efficient chiral light-matter interface. Moreover, our generalization to a 3D bath reveals that coherent dipole-dipole interactions can survive despite the coupling to a continuum of modes, a finding that challenges conventional wisdom regarding decoherence.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous estimation of the three parameters characterizing a pair of incoherent optical sources in the sub-Rayleigh regime, enabling super-resolved scene characterization. Using spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) with two demultiplexers--one deliberately shifted--we determine separations well below the diffraction limit and achieve sensitive joint estimation of separation, centroid, and relative brightness over a broad range of scene configurations in a single experimental setting. We benchmark our performance using Fisher-information-based Cramér-Rao bounds, and discuss the corresponding quantum limits. We investigate two complementary scenarios: a realistic case with slightly non-identical sources, and an idealized case of indistinguishable sources.

*Tim Palmer*

TL;DR: An interpretation of Bell's theorem vacuums the mystery of quantum mechanics violations, linking them to p-adic number theory and a holistic universe, suggesting pursuing a Theory of Everything with particle accelerators is misguided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper proposes an alternative explanation for quantum mechanics violations, aiming to provide a new understanding of the subject.

Method: The author introduces a new model, Rational Mechanics - RaQM, which blends gravitational discretization of Hilbert Space with local realism. This model claims to explain quantum violations without invoking strange processes, employing p-adic number theory and concepts from Bohmian mechanics to build this interpretation.

Result: The paper challenges conventional interpretations of Bell's theorem, suggesting that particle accelerator research into a Theory of Everything might be a dead end.

Conclusion: By rejecting the Measurement Independence assumption and using novel mathematical tools, RaQM provides an alternative framework for understanding quantum mechanics, but does not offer a workable approach to unifying quantum physics with gravity.

Abstract: Negating the Measurement Independence assumption (MI) is often referred to as the `third way' to account for the experimental violation of Bell's inequality. However, this route is generally viewed as ludicrously contrived, implying some implausible conspiracy where experimenters are denied the freedom to choose measurement settings as they like. Here, a locally realistic model of quantum physics is developed (Rational Mechanics - RaQM - based on a gravitational discretisation of Hilbert Space) which violates MI without denying free will. Crucially, RaQM distinguishes experimenters' ability to freely choose measurement settings to some nominal accuracy, from an inability to choose exact settings, which were never under their control anyway. In RaQM, Hilbert states are necessarily undefined in bases where squared amplitudes and/or complex phases are irrational numbers. Such `irrational' bases correspond to conceivable but necessarily impossible counterfactual measurements, and are shown to play a ubiquitous role in the analysis of both single- and entangled-particle quantum physics. It is concluded that violation of Bell inequalities can be understood with none of the strange processes historically associated with it. Instead, using concepts from (non-classical) $p$-adic number theory, we relate RaQM to Bohm and Hiley's concept of a holistic Machian-like Undivided Universe. If this interpretation of Bell's Theorem is correct, building more and more energetic particle accelerators to probe smaller and smaller scales, in the search for a theory which synthesises quantum and gravitational physics and hence a Theory of Everything, may be a fruitless exercise.

TL;DR:  paper proposes a new method to improve low-frequency performance of fiber-optic vibration sensors using a Floquet-engineered optical lattice clock demodulation scheme._


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  improving the sensitivity and stability of vibration sensors is crucial for various applications such as structural health monitoring, precision measurement, and industrial automation. conventional demodulation methods may struggle with low-frequency signals, hence the need for this novel approach. 

Method:  the proposed method utilizes a floquet-engineered optical lattice clock, which involves creating a periodic modulation in the transition frequencies of the atomic clock. this periodic modulation is matched with the vibrational signals of interest, allowing for effective demodulation of the phase changes induced by vibrations. the floquet engine ensures that the clock frequencies are synchronized with the vibration frequencies, enhancing sensitivity in the low-frequency range. additionally, the paper mentions simulations of the lattice depth and the resulting phase change sensitivity under different vibration frequencies. by adjusting the fiber length and transmission loss, they achieved a phase change sensitivity higher than 6 × 10³ rad per g for both 200 Hz and 0.5 Hz vibrations. the key innovation lies in the integration of floquet theory with optical lattice clocks to tailor the clock's response to specific vibration frequencies, thereby improving the overall performance of vibration sensors in the low-frequency domain. 

Result:  the study demonstrates that with a 4 km fiber length and 2 dB/km transmission loss, the phase change sensitivity of the proposed demodulation scheme exceeds 6 × 10³ rad per g for both 200 Hz and 0.5 Hz. this result suggests that the method is highly effective in addressing the challenges associated with low-frequency vibration sensing using fiber-optic sensors. the improved sensitivity makes the system robust and suitable for applications requiring precise monitoring at low frequencies. the simulations highlight the potential of the floquet-engineered optical lattice clock in enhancing the performance of traditional fiber-optic vibrational sensors. the findings contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable vibration sensing technologies. 

Conclusion:  the paper successfully devise a novel demodulation scheme for fiber-optic vibration sensors leveraging floquet-engineered optical lattice clocks. the results confirm the scheme's effectiveness in achieving high phase change sensitivity across a wide range of low-frequency vibrations. this approach opens new avenues for advancing the capabilities of fiber-optic sensors in low-frequency applications, offering significant potential for practical implementations in various fields such as structural engineering, geophysical exploration, and precision metrology.

Abstract: We propose a Floquet-engineered optical lattice clock based demodulation scheme to enhance the low-frequency performance of wound fiber-optic vibration sensors. Vibration-induced phase variations in the sensing fiber are demodulated by the Floquet-engineered Rabi spectra of the clock transition. The lattice depth with the fiber length and the Floquet-engineered Rabi spectra under the vibration from 200 Hz down to 0.5 Hz are simulated. With a fiber length of 4 km and transmission loss of 2 dB/km, a phase change sensitivity higher than 6 * 10^3 rad per g is achieved at both vibration frequencies of 200 Hz and 0.5 Hz.

Here, we present a toolkit for MBQC using optical binomial codes, detailing a cavity-QED protocol for conditional generation of cluster states and the implementation of Pauli measurements. Our work proposes the first steps for existing optical atom-cavity architectures to lay the groundwork for their use in quantum computation.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.

Motivation: The paper explores how quantum computing can enhance physics-informed neural networks for solving complex PDEs, which has wide-ranging applications in science and finance.

Method: The authors developed hybrid quantum-classical networks, tested them on various nonlinear PDEs, and compared their performance with classical networks by measuring training epochs and accuracy.

Result: Quantum networks demonstrated a significant reduction in training epochs, especially for complex problems, while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that quantum-enhanced neural networks could revolutionize numerical modeling, particularly in computational science and finance.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the backbone of simulations of many natural phenomena, for example in climate modeling, material science, and even financial markets. The application of physics-informed neural networks to accelerate the solution of PDEs is promising, but not competitive with numerical solvers yet. Here, we show how quantum computing can improve the ability of physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. For this, we develop hybrid networks consisting of quantum circuits combined with classical layers and systematically test them on various non linear PDEs and boundary conditions in comparison with purely classical networks. We demonstrate that the advantage of using quantum networks lies in their ability to achieve an accurate approximation of the solution in substantially fewer training epochs, particularly for more complex problems. These findings provide the basis for targeted developments of hybrid quantum neural networks with the goal to significantly accelerate numerical modeling.

Abstract: Superconducting qubit networks (SQNs) embedded in a low-dissipative resonator is a promising device allowing one not only to establish the collective quantum dynamics on a macroscopic scale but also to greatly enhance the sensitivity of detectors of microwave photons. A quantum ac Stark effect provided by coupling between an SQN and microwave photons of a resonator, leads to a strong nonlinear interaction between photons. Here, we present a two-tone spectroscopy experiment in which a set of 10 superconducting flux qubits is coupled to the input R- resonator and the output T- transmission line. An external microwave pump field close to the resonance frequency populates macroscopically the resonator mode as a Bose-Einstein condensate, while a second probe beam scans the resonances referred also as Bogoliubov-like excitations. The corresponding excitation frequency measured from the transmission coefficient, |S21(f)| displays an abrupt change of the resonant dip position once the power of the pump field overcomes a critical value Pcr. This sharp shift occurs in a narrow region of pump frequencies, and can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. It is a signature of bistability of the photon number inside the resonator, in agreement with theory.

Abstract: In an entanglement summoning task, a set of distributed, co-operating parties attempt to fulfill requests to prepare entanglement between distant locations. The parties share limited communication resources: timing constraints may require the entangled state be prepared before some pairs of distant parties can communicate, and a restricted set of links in a quantum network may further constrain communication. Building on earlier work, we continue the characterization of entanglement summoning. We give an if and only if condition on entanglement summoning tasks with only bidirected causal connections, and provide a set of sufficient conditions addressing the most general case containing both oriented and bidirected causal connections. Our results rely on the recent development of entanglement sharing schemes.

Abstract: Recently, Jordan et al. (Nature, 2025) introduced a novel quantum-algorithmic technique called Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) for solving specific combinatorial optimization problems associated with classical codes. They presented a constraint-satisfaction problem called Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) and showed that, for this problem, a DQI algorithm running in polynomial time can satisfy a larger fraction of constraints than any known polynomial-time classical algorithm.
  In this work, we propose several improvements to the DQI algorithm, including sidestepping the quadratic-time Dicke state preparation. Given random access to the input, we show how these improvements result in a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for the OPI problem. Concurrently and independently with this work, Khattar et al. (arXiv:2510:10967) also construct a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for OPI using slightly different techniques.

TL;DR: 研究发现在马尔可夫过程下，量子热力学探针的温度偏差会影响其精度，只有初态比热 baths更冷才能超越稳态限制，而非马尔科夫过程可同时实现高温和低温探针的同样高精度。

Method: 通过建立基于马尔可夫过程的量子热力学模型，计算不同初态和环境条件下探针的精度随时间的变化。

Result: 1. 在马尔科夫过程中，只有当探针初始温度低于对应环境温度时，才能超越稳态精度限制；2. 非马尔科夫过程中，无论是高温还是低温探针都能达到超越稳态的精度。

Conclusion: 温度偏差在马尔科夫过程中的重要性直接影响探测精度，而非马尔科夫过程则提供了更大的设计灵活性，使得探针精度不受初态温度限制。

Abstract: We unveil a temperature bias of the probe in transient quantum thermometry under Markovian dynamics. Specifically, for qubit thermometers evolving under Markovian dynamics, we show that enhanced precision beyond the steady state limit can be achieved if and only if the probe is initially colder than the thermal state corresponding to the bath temperature to be estimated. In contrast, this temperature bias can be lifted when the probe dynamics is non-Markovian. In the non-Markovian regime, both hot and cold probes can simultaneously attain the same transient maximum precision, well above the steady-state value.

Abstract: Josephson junctions made of conventional superconductors display Fraunhofer-like oscillations of the critical current as a function of the threaded magnetic flux. When the superconductors are deposited on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, this pattern is slightly modified due to the presence of chiral Majorana modes. Here we calculate the critical current of a Corbino Josephson junction, where the fluxoid becomes quantized and the superconducting phase has an integer winding. We discover that circular junctions exhibit similar behavior in both topologically trivial and non-trivial scenarios, while non-circular junctions demonstrate a remarkable distinction. Using a simple analytical model, we show that these non-circular junctions exhibit reentrant superconductivity with a period related to their number of corners, and numerically we find that this period is halved in the topological case. The period halving may help establish the existence of topological superconductivity in hybrid topological insulator-superconductor junctions.

Abstract: We compare two complementary theoretical approaches to compute and interpret Floquet sidebands in periodically driven quantum materials: a first-order perturbative approach (first-order perturbative Born approximation, PB1) and time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (tdNEGF). Using graphene as a model Dirac system, we disentangle in pump-probe setups Floquet-dressed initial states, Volkov-dressed final states (also known as laser-assisted photoelectric effect, LAPE), and their interference. We quantify how photoemission matrix elements, polarization, incidence angle, and near-surface screening shape the momentum-resolved sideband intensity observed in tr-ARPES. PB1 yields an analytical expression for the momentum-dependent sideband intensity, and for graphene it captures the correct symmetry trends, such as the magnitude of the intensities when considering the interference between the Floquet and Volkov states and photoemission matrix elements. tdNEGF reproduces the full energy-momentum-resolved spectra, including hybridization gaps and spectral-weight redistribution. We find qualitative agreement between PB1 and tdNEGF once matrix elements are included; quantitative differences arise near hybridization regions and at specific angles where higher-order processes and self-energies are essential. Thus, for systems with simple band structures and away from these regions, the two approaches can be used in a complementary way.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解二维 Kagome 磁体 Nb_3 Cl_8 的量子自旋液态态特性以及其实现的未来应用打下了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Recent research suggests the possibility of the two-dimensional breathing-Kagome magnet Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ hosting a quantum spin liquid state, warranting further study into its magnetic properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ has short-range antiferromagnetic correlations among Nb$_3$ trimers with S = 1/2, and becomes magnetically frustrated due to the underlying effective triangular lattice geometry, and is evidenced by a frustration index of f > 1. The high-temperature susceptibility shows a negative Weiss temperature from Monte Carlo calculations. Considering spin-orbit coupling, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy, including anisotropic exchange, single-ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using the four-state energy mapping formalism. Although the elements have relatively small atomic numbers, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is comparable in magnitude to the anisotropic exchange. Additionally, we show that biaxial strain tunes the short-range correlations between antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. These findings strengthen our understanding of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ and advance its applications in current condensed matter physics and materials science research, including nanoscale mechanical and spintronics applications.

Motivation: 本研究目的是探索有限宽度、多轨道的 s-型超导纳米线中 Majorana 异常模式的存在性，这有助于理解 Majorana 量子比特在实际纳米设备中的潜在应用。

Method: 通过引入截断弦截断和精确对角化，研究了不同电子自旋轨道间的配对激发，系统性地分析了异配能隙和局部能谱函数，得出了 Majorana 异常零模式仅存在于其中一链的结论。

Result: 研究发现，在单链 Kitaev 模型失效的情况下，两链 p-波 Kitaev 类型系统被构造出来，通过精确对角化确定部分能隙是否为零，且通过局域谱函数证实了 Majorana 异常零模式的存在性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种有限宽度 s-型多轨道超导纳米线的新模型，那种 Majorana 异常零模式的存在性经测试，证明了在有限宽度多轨道 Kitaev 模型中， Majorana 异常零模式确实是可能的。

Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.

Abstract: Excitation energy transfer (EET) in an organic/inorganic nanohybrid system, composed of a single \textit{para}-sexiphenyl (6P) molecule physisorbed on a finite-sized MoS$_2$ nanoflake, is investigated theoretically. %
The electronic structure of the MoS$_2$ nanoflake is described by using an 11-band tight-binding model, in which edge states are passivated with H atoms to restore a well-defined bandgap. %
Within a configuration-interaction scheme, excitonic states are constructed and, for computational efficiency, approximated by uncorrelated electron-hole pairs in the relevant high-energy window. %
The EET rates are evaluated via Fermi's golden rule, incorporating Coulomb coupling, thermal broadening, and spectral overlap between the molecular excitation and the MoS$_2$ nanoflake's electron-hole pairs. %
Our results reveal that energy transfer from the molecule to the nanoflake is the dominant process, and its efficiency depends strongly on the size of the MoS$_2$ nanoflake, as well as the molecule's vertical distance and lateral position relative to the nanoflake.

Result: 实验结果与文献中的WSe2单层和三层文献值一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究2D材料提供了切实可行的实验手段。

Abstract: In 2D field effect transistors the gate electrostatically dopes the 2D semiconductor (2DSC) channel, tuning the Fermi level. In principle, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) can detect the Fermi level, and its dependence on gate bias as well as position, potentially directly yielding band gaps, contact barriers, spatial nonuniformities, and sub-gap densities of states in such devices. However, KPFM relies on an oscillating probe voltage which itself electrostatically dopes the 2DSC, potentially creating a nonlinear response. Here, we show that when a suitably thin hBN back-gate dielectric is used, the KPFM signal agrees well with expectations, as explained by a quasistatic charge-balance model. Corresponding experimental results show excellent consistency with the literature values of the bandgaps of monolayer and trilayer WSe2. With this approach, the widely available technique of KPFM should find improved utility and new uses in the study of 2D devices.

TL;DR: One-dimensional topological Anderson insulators show how disorder can lead to robust topological phases through successive phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of disorder in topological phases is crucial in the field of condensed matter physics.

Method: The research combines theoretical analysis of topological invariants, experimental demonstrations in topolectrical circuits, and numerical simulations of edge state localization.

Result: The study confirms that one-dimensional topological Anderson insulators undergo disorder-driven topological transitions, resulting in a topological Anderson phase that remains robust even at strong disorder.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for controlling topological phases through disorder, paving the way for the field of topological disordertronics.

Abstract: One-dimensional topological Anderson insulators provide a paradigm for disorder-induced topological phases in which the underlying system turns from a trivial to a topological phase. It is widely recognized that the latter vanishes at large disorder amplitude. Here, and contrary to the general belief, we provide evidence for a successive disorder-driven topological transitions in a single-wall nanotube, culminating in a topological Anderson phase that remains unexpectedly robust at strong disorder. This phenomenon is confirmed by analysis of the corresponding topological invariant, which increases stepwise as disorder increases, giving evidence for the emergence of edge states. We experimentally implement these topological Anderson staircase phase transitions in a one-dimensional topolectrical circuit, where the persistence of edge states is revealed by node-voltage measurements. The robustness of the edge states is corroborated by numerical calculations of their localization properties. Our work opens the road to topological disordertronics, where topological phases can be tuned by disorder.

Conclusion: 该研究为实验中观察零速度 Majorana 模式提供了理论框架，并揭示了其对Josephson现象的影响，具有实际应用场景。

Abstract: We study planar Josephson junctions formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (Fu-Kane proposal) and examine the experimentally relevant parameter regimes in which the effective velocity of the emergent one-dimensional Majorana modes approaches zero. We show that the frequently employed Fu-Kane effective theory breaks down in this case. As parameters like the chemical potential or the width of the junction are tuned, instances of vanishing effective velocity mark the emergence of additional 'Dirac cones' at zero energy and finite momentum. If the junction is subjected to an external magnetic field, Josephson vortices may then bind a number of zero modes in addition to the topological Majorana mode. The additional zero modes are 'symmetry-protected' and can be lifted by a broken mirror symmetry (which is to be expected in realistic scenarios) as well as by an in-plane magnetization (or Zeeman field). We note that the ensuing presence of additional low-energy Andreev states can significantly contribute to measured quantities like the Josephson current or microwave absorption spectra.

Abstract: Integration of high-quality photon emitters at specific locations within nanophotonic structures or optoelectronic devices is a key to innovating on-chip optical control and quantum technologies. Halide perovskite nanoparticles have great potential as single photon emitters with high quantum efficiency. To achieve their full potential, they must be embedded in a host material that ensures chemical stability and passivates surface defects. A previous experiment on a CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposite film suggested possibility that electron beam irradiation can be used to control positions of CsPbBr3 nano-light sources in the Cs4PbBr6 host although the effects of electron beam irradiation are not fully understood. Here, we fabricate a Cs4PbBr6-CsBr film, not containing the CsPbBr3 phase, and provide direct evidence that CsPbBr3 nanoparticles can be locally generated in the Cs4PbBr6 host by irradiation with a focused electron beam. We further demonstrate perovskite nano-light source arrays with submicron spacing using this method.

Abstract: We study spin-dependent transport in an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with cosine modulated nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. Suitable tuning of the hopping parameters yields a complete separation of spin channels and perfect spin polarization over broad energy windows. The inclusion of next-nearest-neighbor hopping enhances both tunability and robustness, while systematic phase-diagram analyses reveal quantized polarization across extended regions of parameter space rather than at isolated fine-tuned points. These characteristics persist for larger system sizes, establishing the extended SSH model as a versatile platform for controllable spin-polarized transport.

Abstract: Semimetals exhibit intriguing characteristics attributed to the coexistence of both electrons and holes. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators. These findings establish rhombohedral multilayer graphene as an ideal platform for studying strong correlations and topologies in semimetals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CISS的未来发展依赖于更好地理解双态弯曲结构在弱电声环境中如何产生自旋极化。

Method: 通过在微分出平衡状态下的非平衡格林函数（NEGF）框架内，使用螺旋无因次的模型，考虑了自旋-轨道相互作用和电子-声耦合。

Result: 对不同时频、强度、偏置、温度和系统尺寸的参数进行测试后，发现完全自洽的SCBA处理下，自旋极化量极小，电声耦合主要修改能带结构，且传输特性高度保持 Originally Quasi-ballistic。

Conclusion: 与近似处理中的巨大自旋极化和异常尺寸效应相比，完全自洽的计算表明金属传导特性仍是高度一致的。

Abstract: A central open question in chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is whether weak electron-phonon coupling in a helical molecular junction can generate a sizable spin polarization in two-terminal transport without invoking additional strong symmetry-breaking ingredients. We address this question by implementing a self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculation for a helical tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions. The electron-phonon self-energies are evaluated self-consistently, and the transport signal is extracted using the standard magnetization-reversal protocol with a spin-polarized analyzer lead. We benchmark a fully self-consistent NEGF within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) treatment for both global and local electron-phonon couplings against commonly used approximations, including diagonal self-energy schemes. We quantify how the resulting transport regime and spin polarization depend on phonon frequency, coupling strength, bias, temperature, and system size. In contrast to large polarizations and anomalous size trends reported under approximate treatments, the fully self-consistent calculation yields negligible spin polarization, additionally the electron-phonon coupling mainly renormalizes the spectrum, and transport remains quasi-ballistic across the explored parameter range.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper reports direct spectroscopic evidence of antimagnons, which align with theoretical predictions, opening new avenues in magnon-antimagnon physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work bridges the gap between conventional spintronic basics and the emerging field of antimagnonics, opening new research directions in magneto-optical devices and nano-electronics.

Method: Using super-resolution Kerr rotational imaging, the researchers captured ultrafast spin wave dynamics in real-time with femtosecond pump-probe pulses, achieving subfemtosecond resolution to observe the spin wave kinetics in the femtosecond timescale.

Result: The ultrafast spin wave dynamics demonstrate that dynamic spin waves can be emitted at individual Bloch points, and the FemtoSOL slow manifold exhibits spin waves that are steeper in the negative energy cones than positive ones, with the ability to continuously release energy into the environment.

Conclusion: Antimagnons exhibit intriguing signatures compatible with negative-energy spin waves and represent a unique form of magnon-like excitations that are expected to inspire new functionalities and applications in the field of magnonics.

Abstract: We report direct spectroscopic evidence of antimagnons, i.e., negative-energy spin waves identified by their signature inverted dispersion with Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy. We investigate an ultrathin BiYIG film with a perpendicular magnetized anisotropy that compensates the demagnetizing field. By injecting a spin-orbit torque, the magnetization is driven into auto-oscillation and eventually into a non-equilibrium reversed state above a secondary current threshold ($\sim$1.2$\times$10$^7$~A/cm$^2$). The dispersion is measured by wavevector-resolved BLS and exhibits a sharp change from an upward dispersion to a downward one, in agreement with theoretical predictions and micromagnetic simulations. Around the threshold current, we observe the coexistence of conventional magnons and antimagnons. Our work establishes antimagnons with inverted dispersion and is a first step towards exploring novel phenomena and applications due to magnon-antimagnon coupling, such as magnon amplification and magnon-antimagnon entanglement, which are part of the emerging field of antimagnonics.

Abstract: Predicting the forced vibration response of nonlinear mechanical systems with friction is critical for engineering applications. Accurately determining the backbone curve of resonance peaks is pivotal for the design of friction devices. However, the prediction of these curves is computationally challenging owing to the nonconservative and nonsmooth nature of friction nonlinearity. Although techniques such as damped nonlinear normal modes (dNNMs) and phase resonance methods have been applied, they often suffer from convergence issues, and their computational accuracy is compromised under certain conditions. This study proposes a novel method for computing the forced response backbone curves of structures with frictional contact interfaces. The method accurately tracks the backbone curve through a parameter continuation scheme, formulated via Lagrange multipliers and accelerated by incorporating a derived analytical Hessian Tensor of contact elements. This approach yields highly accurate numerical results and enables numerical singularities on the curve to be identified and robustly traversed. The proposed method is validated using an Euler-Bernoulli beam finite-element model and a lumped-parameter blade-damper-blade model. The results demonstrate superior accuracy compared to conventional dNNMs and phase resonance methods, particularly in cases involving either high structural damping or strong frictional damping. This work provides a robust computational tool and presents a detailed comparative analysis that clarifies the applicability and limitations of the proposed and conventional methods.

Abstract: Ten high resolution Fourier transform spectra of the pentad region near 3.3 μm of methane diluted in carbon dioxide at total pressures up to 800 hPa have been recorded at 296.5(5) K. Including a high resolution spectrum of pure methane at low pressure, these spectra have been analyzed using multi-spectrum fitting techniques. The methane lines were modeled using hard-collision speed-dependent line profiles and line mixing was included in the strongest absorption regions, considering the first order Rosenkranz approximation and the relaxation matrix formalism. CO$_2$ broadening and shift coefficients have been measured, together with the speed dependence of broadening. Results obtained using the two line mixing models are intercompared and compared with previous work.

Method: 本文通过微分方程的方法推导斥项的二次方程，并结合积分方法计算第二类色散系数，最终利用数值计算验证了结果的准确性。

Result: 结果显示，随着温度的升高，斥参数的衰减速度慢于之前假设的二次方，这使得之前基于二次方假设的计算结果误差较大，建议采用与温度的-1/6次幂相关的模型更为精确。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解气体相互作用提供了新的理论视角，并通过VC展开式改进了色散系数的计算精度。

Abstract: The attraction term in an equation of state for gases, $-a c^2$, proposed by Rankine in 1854, is generally related to the London dispersion force via a calculation of the second virial coefficient, $B_2$, by an equation $B_2 = 2πN_0 \int_0^\infty \left(1- \exp \left(ω/ kT\right)\right) r^2 \text{d}r$, where $ω$ is the potential of the attraction between two molecules in the gas. Here we present an alternative approach that does not use this equation, and does not a-priori assume that the function is quadratic in concentration, $c$. Still, the quadratic dependence on concentration is also found. We analyze a gas consisting of argon at temperatures between 200 and 700 K. From the numerical calculations, we derive that the attraction parameter depends on temperature according to a -1/6 power scaling, and thus the attraction component to the second virial coefficient, $B_2$, scales with a -7/6 power to temperature. For the same conditions, the virial equation presented above results in a square root scaling of $B_2$ with temperature, which is less accurate.

Abstract: We study light-mediated interactions between spatially separated molecules using real-time quantum electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory based on the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. An ultrashort delta-kick excitation selectively perturbs a single molecule, while a second, distant molecule remains initially unexcited. In free space, the excitation stays localized and no response is observed in the second molecule. In contrast, when both molecules are coupled to the same cavity mode, the initial excitation induces coherent dynamics in the distant molecule through the shared quantized electromagnetic field.

Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials enable large systems to be simulated for long time scales at near ab-initio accuracy. This accuracy is achieved by fitting extremely flexible model architectures to high quality reference data. In practice, this flexibility can cause unwanted behavior such as jagged predicted potential energy surfaces and generally poor out-of-distribution behavior. We investigate a general strategy for incorporating prior beliefs on the regularity of the target energy into linear ACE models and explore to what extent this approach improves the quality of the fitted models. Our main focus is an over-regularisation that replicates the Gaussian broadening used in SOAP descriptors within the ACE framework.

Conclusion: 这些发现丰富了对原子动力学的理解

Abstract: In solids, elementary excitations of atomic vibrations are identified in reciprocal space by their frequency and wavevector as phonons. At the opposite end of the matter spectrum, dynamics of dilute gases is conventionally described in terms of atomic or molecular collisions and translations in real space and time. These two formalisms are apparently incompatible, leading to difficulties in understanding atomic dynamics in intermediate matter. In this work, we demonstrate that normal modes, often synonymously considered as phonons in solids, provide a microscopic description of various transport processes, including thermal conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and shear viscosity, in a prototypical dilute gas, argon. Our results reveal that normal modes constitute elementary excitations in dilute gases, extending their physical relevance far beyond vibrational excitations in solids.
