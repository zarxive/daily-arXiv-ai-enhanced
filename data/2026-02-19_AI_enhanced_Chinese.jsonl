Inference at the sensor edge determines experimental data collection efficiency by deciding which information to save for further analysis. Particle tracking detectors at the Large Hadron Collider exemplify this challenge: pixelated silicon sensors generate rich spatiotemporal ionization patterns, yet most of this information is discarded due to data-rate limitations. Concurrently, advancements in co-design tools provide rapid turn-around for incorporating machine learning into application-specific integrated circuits, motivating designs for particle detectors with new integrated technologies. We demonstrate that neural networks embedded in the front-end electronics can infer charged-particle kinematic parameters from a single silicon layer. We regress hit positions and incident angles with calibrated uncertainties, while satisfying stringent constraints on numerical precision, latency, and silicon area.

Although chemical functionalization can significantly enhance graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance, it often degrades graphene's intrinsic in-plane phonon transport. In this work, we perform a systematic deep neural network molecular dynamics study comparing edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbons with surface-functionalized graphene in aqueous environments. We demonstrate that functionalizing only 10% of the ribbon edges with hydroxyl groups increases the graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance by more than eightfold, primarily due to strengthened interfacial interactions and improved wettability at the edges. In contrast to basal-plane oxidation, edge functionalization largely preserves in-plane thermal conductivity. Importantly, hydroxyl edge groups exert competing effects on phonon transport: they introduce additional boundary scattering that suppresses heat conduction, while simultaneously passivating dangling bonds at bare edges, thereby reducing phonon localization and edge-induced scattering. This competition leads to a non-monotonic dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity on edge functionalization ratio. These results establish edge functionalization as an effective strategy for enhancing graphene-water interfacial thermal transport without sacrificing intrinsic phonon transport properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level.

Here, we present Chem-SIM, a structured-illumination fluorescence detected mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, for super-resolution chemical imaging of microorganisms and mammalian cells. A computational pipeline combining Poisson maximum-likelihood demodulation and spectral normalization across wavenumber is implemented to robustly recover the weak IR-induced fluorescence intensity change under low photon budgets and convert the fluorescence intensity modulation to chemical fingerprints. A photothermal gating scheme further rejects water backgrounds in aqueous samples, while the IR pump maintains cellular activity at near-physiological temperature. Chem-SIM preserves full vibrational fingerprints, achieves SIM-grade lateral resolution, and operates in a high-throughput, camera-based format with minimal modifications and low photothermal load. At the single-bacterium level, Chem-SIM distinguishes stationary phase from log phase cells through chemical content mapping.

Realizing such flat bands has thus far relied primarily on moir\u00e9 graphene superlattices or rhombohedral stacking graphene systems, both of which face challenges in reproducibility and tunability. Here, we introduce an artificial Kagome superlattice in bilayer graphene, engineered via nanopatterning of the dielectric substrate to create a precisely defined and electrostatically tunable periodic potential. Magnetotransport measurements reveal the emergence of a stack of correlated insulating states at moderate superlattice potentials, characteristic of strong electron-electron interactions within Kagome-induced flat bands.

SymbolicCI provides analytic Hamiltonian matrix elements for efficient large-scale calculations; NOCI-F delivers benchmark-quality couplings. The resulting diabatic Hamiltonians can be coupled to quantum dynamics simulations. Applications to ethylene aggregates and the anthracene crystal reveal CTX configurations as electronic gateways bridging excitonic manifolds, with CT-mediated relaxation pathways competing with conventional annihilation. In H-type aggregates, LECT admixture stabilizes a \"bi-excimer\" analogous to one-particle excimers.

The PHEOD solitons are completely stable, and, unlike the conventional solitons, they feature oscillatory tails.

Optical dipole traps do not have these drawbacks but have difficulties producing atomic samples with a large number of atoms at ultra low temperature in the absence of gravity. Here, we report on an efficient evaporative cooling in two-crossed laser beams during parabolic flights. Time-averaged potentials combine the advantages of large capture volume and trap compression, increasing the initial phase space density and collision rate to favor the evaporative process.

It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To determine whether these results extend to more generic one-dimensional models, particularly those realizable in quantum simulators, we investigate spin and energy transport in non-integrable, long-range Heisenberg models using state-of-the-art tensor network methods. Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 < \u03b1< \\infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \\sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges. Finally, we consider anisotropic spin models naturally realized in Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules, demonstrating that a wide range of long-lived, non-diffusive transport can be observed in experimental settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u8f93\u8fd0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51faKPZ\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55Heisenberg\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u591a\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u53ef\u79ef\u3001\u957f\u7a0bHeisenberg\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u8f93\u8fd0\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6301\u7eed\u7684z=3/2\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c \u042d\u0442\u043e\u0442\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e2 < \u03b1 < \u221e\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5e42\u5f8b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u95f4z=3/2\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u4e0eKPZ\u7f29\u653e\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u76f4\u5230t \u2248 10\u00b3/J\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0eIzsimplectsev\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u8fd1\u90bb\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u7684Izsimplectsev\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7684\u957f\u5185\u5b58\u4f20\u8f93\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u957f\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u8f93\u8fd0\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0eKPZ\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5bc6\u5207\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

In this work, we revisit curvature-squared string-inspired effective actions, from the point of view of appropriate local field redefinitions, leaving the perturbative string scattering matrices invariant. We require simultaneously unitarity and torsion interpretation of the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor, features characterising the (3+1)-dimensional StRVM Cosmology. Unlike the higher dimensional case, the above feature is possible in the context of (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, obtained after string compactification. We demonstrate that the unitarity and torsion-interpretation requirements lead to a single-type of extra four-derivative terms in the effective gravitational action, not discussed in the previous literature of StRVM, which however is shown to be subleading by many orders of magnitude, compared to the terms of the StRVM framework. Hence, its presence has no practical implications for the relevant inflationary (and, hence, postinflationary) physics of the StRVM. This demonstrates the phenomenological completeness of the StRVM cosmological scenario, which is thus fully embeddable in the UV complete (quantum-gravity compatible) string theory framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u6563\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

Here, we show that one can continuously transform a system between a topological phase associated with one dimension and a topological phase associated with two dimensions without closing the energy gap. In this process, the dimension of the system itself changes. Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the present study it is shown that this is not necessarily the case. Using standard thermodynamics, the general characteristics of phase transitions are investigated, considering an arbitrary number of conserved particle species and coexisting phases, and an arbitrary set of state variables. It is found that there exist two different possible types of realizations of a phase transition. In the first type, one has the immediate replacement of a single phase with another one. As a consequence, some of the global extensive variables indeed behave discontinuously. In the second type, one has instead the gradual (dis-) appearance of a single phase over a range of the state variables. This leads to a continuous behavior of the (global) basic thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, in this case it is not possible to define a latent heat in a trivial manner. It is derived that the latter (former) case happens if the number of extensive state variables used is larger or equal (lower) than the number of coexisting phases. The choice of the state variables thus place a crucial role for the qualitative properties of the phase transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores phase transitions in thermodynamics, revealing two types of transitions: contiguous and discontinuous, influenced by the choice of state variables.", "motivation": "Understanding the nuances of phase transitions, especially regarding continuity and discontinuity, is crucial for accurately modeling thermodynamic systems in various scientific fields.", "method": "The study employs standard thermodynamic principles, analyzing systems with multiple conserved particle species and coexisting phases using a general framework.", "result": "The research identifies two distinct types of phase transitions.

It is well known that, in the presence of two commuting Killing vector fields, the theory reduces to 3D gravity coupled to an $SL(3,\\mathbb{R})$ nonlinear sigma model with five scalar fields. We show that the scalar fields of the extremal Myers-Perry solution can be expressed in terms of two harmonic functions on 3D flat space, and that promoting these functions to include multiple sources yields explicit multi-centered extremal Myers-Perry black holes located at arbitrary positions. Each center forms a smooth $S^3$ Killing horizon, provided that the rotation parameters satisfy $|j_i|<1/2$. We further demonstrate that all curvature singularities are hidden behind the horizons and that no closed timelike curves arise on or outside the horizons. The solutions are asymptotically locally Minkowski in the sense that constant-time hypersurfaces are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE). As a concrete example, we consider a binary configuration, examine its rod structure, and demonstrate the absence of conical singularities between the two black holes, indicating that they are supported by an intermediate bubble region separating them.", "AI": {"tldr": "Discover new multi-centered rotating black hole solutions in 5D Einstein gravity.", "motivation": "Extending black hole solutions in higher dimensions for theoretical physics.", "method": "Reduces 5D theory to 3D gravity with scalar fields, constructs multi-centered solutions with multiple sources.", "result": "Presented explicit multi-centered extremal Myers-Perry black holes with smooth horizons and ALE asymptotics.", "conclusion": "Contribution to 5D black hole geometry with potential applications in string theory and AdS/CFT."}}

Their performance relies on ultra-stable, narrow-linewidth lasers, frequency stabilized to a compact portable optical cavity. Among various designs, the cubic spacer-based ultra-stable cavity is particularly well-suited for transportable applications due to its low sensitivity to vibrations, owing to its symmetric geometry and robust mounting structure. While longer cavities offer a lower fundamental thermal noise floor, one needs to strike a balance between transportability and size. In this aspect, the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity offers a lower fundamental thermal noise floor in comparison to smaller counterparts, while still retaining a reasonable SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) for terrestrial and aerial PNT applications. Its dual-axis design also enables multi-wavelength laser stabilization, making it a promising candidate for future transportable clock applications. This work presents a detailed study of the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity using FEM (Finite Element Method) to evaluate its mechanical and thermal stability. We analyze the impact of various geometric factors, mounting forces, and machining imperfections, while also modelling thermal effects such as conduction, radiation, and mirror heating within a vacuum chamber and thermally shielded environment.

Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering. Beyond uncovering the diffusion-driven mechanism, this work establishes metal intercalation as an effective strategy for tailoring durable graphene-metal heterostructures with tunable properties for next-generation quantum materials platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4ecb\u7535\u4f53\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u5bf9\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u751f\u957f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u751f\u957f\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4e0e\u65ad\u88c2\u6297\u538b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6c14\u76f8\u7269\u8d28\u6e17\u900f\u6cd5\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u4e86\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65ad\u88c2\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u5c42\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5bf9\u5176\u65ad\u88c2\u6297\u538b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6c14\u76f8\u7269\u8d28\u6e17\u900f\u5bf9\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cdlder\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4e0e\u65ad\u88c2\u6297\u538b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u5c42\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5bf9\u5176\u65ad\u88c2\u6297\u538b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4ecb\u7535\u4f53\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u5bf9\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u751f\u957f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6c14\u76f8\u7269\u8d28\u6e17\u900f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u65ad\u88c2\u6297\u538b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u3001\u6c14\u76f8\u7269\u8d28\u6e17\u900f\u3001\u65ad\u88c2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6563\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u65ad\u88c2\u6297\u538b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\u6c14\u76f8\u7269\u8d28\u6e17\u900f\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ecb\u7535\u4f53\u5747\u5300\u8d34\u8986\u6c14\u76f8\u7269\u8d28\u6e17\u900f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5355\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u65ad\u88c2\u6297\u538b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6c14\u76f8\u7269\u8d28\u6e17\u900f\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

However, the range of system functions accessible critically depends on the extent to which free-space and fiber components can be made integrable. The ultralow-expansion cavity-stabilized laser$-$often used in precision metrology, high-resolution sensors, and advanced systems in atomic physics$-$is one component that currently has no direct parallel on chip. Lasers stabilized to photonically-integrated resonators exist, but exhibit considerably higher frequency noise and are accompanied by large levels of frequency drift. We demonstrate here a new architecture for an ultranarrow linewidth integrated laser based on stabilization to a sinusoidal fringe of an interferometer having a long 25-m unbalanced delay line. Our interferometric laser not only advances the state-of-the-art for on-chip lasers, but we in addition introduce an amplitude locking scheme that greatly suppresses the laser's long-term frequency wander. We achieve a record on-chip fractional frequency noise of $5.6 \\times 10^{-14}$, corresponding to a linewidth of 12 Hz centered at 1348 nm. To showcase the utility of this laser, we divide the optical carrier to microwave frequencies, demonstrating the ability to outperform state-of-the-art quartz crystal oscillators by 15 dB or more.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u8c03\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u6807\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u7ea7\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u9ad8\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u957f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65e0\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u9891\u5668\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u5149\u6807\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e45\u503c\u9501\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865.6e-14\u7684\u5149\u6807\u9891\u7387\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e3a12Hz\uff0c1348nm\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9891\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u6807\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5149-\u5fae\u6ce2\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002"}}

For partitions with a single junction, $\\mathrm{GM}^{(\\mathtt{q})}_2$ exhibits a universal scaling crossover in $L/\u03be$, growing for $L\\ll\u03be$ and saturating to a $\u03be$-dependent constant for $L\\gg\u03be$, up to $\\mathcal{O}(e^{-L/\u03be})$ corrections. In sharp contrast, for partitions without a junction, $\\mathrm{GM}^{(\\mathtt{q})}_2$ is exponentially suppressed in $L/\u03be$ and drops below numerical resolution once $L\\gg\u03be$. We observe the same pattern for $\\mathtt{q}=3$ (tripartite) and $\\mathtt{q}=4$ (quadripartite) cases, and further corroborate this localization by translating the junction at fixed system size. We also provide a geometric explanation of the junction law in holography.

Nonetheless, fabrication challenges and performance degradation attributable to surface oxidation and lack of uniformity in films thinner than 5 nm remain a significant barrier for achieving high-quality detectors. In this work, we study the influence of a Silicon capping layer on film properties and on the performance of SNSPDs. A Silicon capping layer effectively suppresses oxidation and increases the superconducting transition temperature. This enables superconductivity in films as thin as 3 nm at 3 K, increases critical current in patterned nanowires and significantly extends the saturation plateau from the visible to the near infrared (up to 2050 nm): These detectors maintain sub-50 ps timing jitter, even for nanowires as wide as 250 nm and with detection areas of 20x20\u03bcm2.

The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an \"exceptional horn\" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\\sim\\vert \\mathbf{q}\\vert^{\\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone. Moreover, we derive analytic expressions for the associated Landau levels (LLs), whose energies scale with magnetic flux as $E\\sim\u03c6^{\\frac{1}{2n}}$. For the case of the $n$-root Lieb lattice, the zeroth LL is shown to be exceptional. These results are analytically derived for both $n$-root models and numerically demonstrated for certain values of $n$. Finally, we propose a realistic photonic implementation based on coupled ring resonators with a split configuration of optical gain and loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Both models exhibit a robust half-magnetization plateau, and we find that the same 16-site state (quadrupled unit cell) is selected in both cases on the largest 64-site cubic cluster we consider for the plateau state. This contrasts sharply with the effective quantum dimer model prediction which favors the ``R'' state, and demonstrates the breakdown of the perturbative mechanism at the Heisenberg point.

This is typically addressed using a Shack-Hartmann sensor, which pairs a high-speed camera with a lenslet array, but such systems add significant cost, weight, and power demands. In this work, we present a hybrid opto-electric neural network (OENN) wavefront sensor that enables ultra-high-speed operation in a compact, low-cost system. Subwavelength diffractive metasurfaces efficiently encode the incoming wavefront into tailored irradiance patterns, which are then decoded by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). In simulation and experiment, the hybrid approach achieves average Strehl ratio (SR) improvements exceeding 60% and 45%, respectively, for unseen wavefronts compared to purely electronic sensors with few-pixel inputs. Although larger MLPs allow purely electronic sensors to match the hybrid's SR under static conditions, transient atmosphere modeling shows that their added latency leads to rapid SR degradation with increasing Greenwood frequency, while the hybrid system maintains performance. These results highlight the potential of hybrid OENN architectures to unlock scalable, high-bandwidth free-space communication systems and, more broadly, to advance optical technologies where real-time sensing is constrained by electronic latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion. Modeling M87* within this framework and imposing the EHT bounds on $\u03b8_d$ and $\u0394C$, we determine the viable $(a,Q)$ parameter space. We find that current observations do not exclude rotating black holes with primary scalar hair, although the allowed region is significantly restricted for $Q>0$. Finally, the scalar-hair-induced deviations are of order $\\mathcal{O}(\u03bc\\mathrm{as})$, placing them near the sensitivity threshold of present instruments and within reach of next-generation horizon-scale imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rotating black holes with scalar hair could explain deviations in strong-field gravity tests like the EHT's M87* image.", "motivation": "Testing the no-hair theorem and understanding black hole physics.", "method": "Constructed rotating black hole solutions in beyond Horndeski gravity, analyzed photon regions, and performed parameter space modeling.", "result": "Negative scalar charges expand and flatten the shadow; positive charges compress and distort it, with current constraints favoring negative charges.", "conclusion": "Current EHT bounds partially allow scalar-hair-induced shadow deviations, near instrument sensitivity and within future imaging capabilities."}}

Spectral analysis of the interferometric outputs reveals that quantum correlations do not increase the amplitude of the modulation peak, but instead lower the associated noise floor, resulting in the expected 3 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. This enhancement persists in the sub-shot-noise regime, where the classical signal becomes buried in the spectral background while the two-photon contribution remains resolvable. These observations establish Fourier-domain quantum super-sensitivity as an operational and broadly applicable resource for precision interferometric sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u5149\u7ea4\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u660e\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u672a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8c03\u5236\u5cf0\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u566a\u58f0_peak\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u76843dB\u4fe1\u53f7-\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u4e9a shot-noise \u5883\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u53f7\u6df9\u6ca1\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u8d21\u732e\u4ecd\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u8fa8\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u8d85\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5e72\u6d89ometric \u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u4fe1\u4ef0\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u5149\u7ea4-based\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4fe1\u53f7\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6355\u6349\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e9a shot-noise \u5883\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8d85\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u672a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8c03\u5236\u5cf0\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u97f3_floor\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u76843dB\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7-\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u4e9a shot-noise \u5883\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u53f7\u6df9\u6ca1\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u8d21\u732e\u4ecd\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u8fa8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u8d85\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5e72\u6d89ometric \u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose that such modifications need not be introduced phenomenologically but can emerge dynamically from stochastic fluctuations of the spacetime metric. We consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe perturbed by a conformal, time-dependent noise factor, whose ensemble average vanishes, leaving the mean background geometry unchanged. By averaging the Einstein equations to second order in the fluctuation amplitude, we derive a modified Friedmann equation that includes an effective correction term. This correction is shown to be equivalent to the general expression obtained from an arbitrary deformation of the entropy-area relation. By specifying the statistical properties, particularly the variance of the conformal noise, we successfully reproduce the Friedmann equation corrections associated with several well-known generalized entropy frameworks, including R\u00e9nyi, (dual) Kaniadakis, Barrow, logarithmic, and MOND inspired hypergeometric entropies.

Although the association between black hole mechanics and black hole thermodynamics is well-established, the comprehensive geometric formulation of thermodynamic variables deserves further investigation. In this work, both Newman-Penrose (NP) and Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalisms are considered within the framework of horizon thermodynamics. We show that the NP formalism reformulates the horizon condition as the Penrose-Rindler equation. In this context, a Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes is recovered from the Penrose-Rindler equation reinterpreted as a horizon equilibrium of pressures, which includes a pressure associated with the horizon rotation. A complete geometric reformulation of this reinterpretation of the Penrose-Rindler equation evaluated at the horizon is developed within the GHP formalism. The GHP approach further inspires the introduction of the horizon-averaged matter pressure and its conjugate volume, thereby enabling a quasi-local realization of the Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes.

Most tests of General Relativity (GR) assume that the spacetime around a black hole is circular, meaning the metric possesses a specific symmetry structure common to the Kerr solution. However, deviations from circularity are predicted by various modified gravity theories and non-vacuum General Relativity solutions. In this work, we test a specific non-circular metric constructed based on a locality principle, where the deviation from the Kerr spacetime is driven by the local spacetime curvature. To accurately model the reflection spectrum in this background, we implement a relativistic ray-tracing code in horizon-penetrating (ingoing Kerr) coordinates, which are favored for their ability to avoid introducing curvature singularities at the horizon in non-circular spacetimes. We apply this model to the high-quality \\textit{NuSTAR} spectrum of the Galactic black hole binary EXO 1846--031. Our spectral analysis reveals a source with a high inclination angle ($\u03b9\\approx 76^{\\circ}$) and a near-extremal spin parameter ($a_* \\approx 0.98$). While we identify a global minimum in the parameter space suggesting a non-zero deformation ($\\ell_{\\mathrm{NP}} \\approx 0.12$), the 99\\% confidence interval fully encompasses the Kerr limit ($\\ell_{\\mathrm{NP}}=0$). We conclude that the current X-ray reflection data for EXO 1846--031 are consistent with the Kerr hypothesis.

We define this phenomenon for quantum states and classical probability distributions, and explore it in three complementary models, one of which exhibits nontrivial quantum coherence at short times. Our main conclusions are as follows. In one dimension, the strong symmetry is not spontaneously broken at any finite time; however, correlators probing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking develop order on length scales that grow linearly in time, parametrically faster than charge diffusion. We provide numerical evidence for this scaling in multiple distinct probes of SW-SSB, and derive it from a field-theory analysis. Moreover, we relate this scaling to the problem of inferring the charge inside a subregion by measuring its surroundings, and construct explicit decoding protocols that illustrate its origin. In two dimensions, field theory and numerical simulations support a finite-time Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like SW-SSB transition. Within continuum hydrodynamics, by contrast, SW-SSB happens at infinitesimal time in two or more dimensions. The SW-SSB transition time can thus be interpreted as marking the emergence of a continuum hydrodynamic description, or (more precisely) the timescale beyond which non-hydrodynamic information such as discrete particle worldlines can no longer be inferred.

Of particular interest in such systems is to understand the circumstances in which, despite the ability to apply time-dependent controls, they lose information about their initial state exponentially with time i.e., their dynamics are exponentially contractive. While there exists an extensive framework to study contractivity for time-independent Lindbladians, their time-dependent counterparts are far less well understood. In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lindbladians, which have a fixed dissipator (describing the interaction with an environment), but with a time-dependent driving Hamiltonian. We establish exponential contractivity in the limit of sufficiently small or sufficiently slow drives together with explicit examples showing that, even when the fixed dissipator is exponentially contractive by itself, a sufficiently large or a sufficiently fast Hamiltonian can result in non-contractive dynamics. Furthermore, we provide a number of sufficient conditions on the fixed dissipator that imply exponential contractivity independently of the Hamiltonian. These sufficient conditions allow us to completely characterize Hamiltonian-independent contractivity for unital dissipators and for two-level systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u8017\u6563\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5c0f\u6216\u6162\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6307\u6570\u6536\u7f29\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u56fa\u5b9a\u8017\u6563\u5668\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56fa\u5b9a\u8017\u6563\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u6216\u6162\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6307\u6570\u6536\u7f29\u6027\uff1b\u56fa\u5b9a\u8017\u6563\u5668\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\u53ef\u4ee5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u9a71\u52a8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u9a71\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u67d0\u4e9b\u56fa\u5b9a\u8017 dissipator\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u3002"}}

From the viewpoint of function approximation, expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits can be viewed as trigonometric polynomials whose accessible Fourier modes are determined by the spectra of the generators. In this study, we describe: (1) a minimax lower bound on the $ L^{2} $-approximation error over a Sobolev ball when the circuit's effective frequency set is contained in a radius-$K$ ball, which yields a scaling law of the form $ \u03a9(K^{\\frac{d}{2} - r}) $ for $ r > \\frac{d}{2} $ (assuming the target function belongs to the Sobolev space $ W_2^{r}(\\mathbb{T}^{d}) $), and we also derive a Jackson-type upper bound on the approximation error of quantum circuits under Sobolev regularity of the target function, expressed in terms of an effective bandwidth determined by generator spectral gaps; (2) a generator-selection rule motivated by enlarging the effective frequency set via non-commuting generators; and (3) a simple heuristic metric based on the trace component of generators, aimed at characterizing training behaviors related to barren plateaus. Simulation experiments on toy problems illustrate the practical implications of the frequency-spectrum perspective and the proposed heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9009\u53d6\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\n motivation: \u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n method: \u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u3002\n result: \u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n conclusion: \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n method: \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u3002\n result: \u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n conclusion: \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8c31\u9699\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6269\u5927\u6709\u6548\u9891\u7387\u96c6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8c31\u7684\u8ff9\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\n result: \u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bL\u00b2-\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3a\u03a9(K^{d/2 -

We report concentration diagnostics based on off-diagonal kernel statistics, spectral richness via effective rank, and centered alignment with labels.

In this work, we show that classical symmetries can be systematically exploited as a design principle for QAOA. Focusing on the MaxCut problem with global bit-flip symmetry, we analyze reduced QAOA instances obtained by fixing a single variable and study how this choice affects the associated DLAs. We show that the structure of the DLAs can change dramatically depending on which variable is held fixed. In particular, we construct explicit examples where the dimension collapses from exponential to quadratic, uncovering phenomena that do not appear in the original formulation.\n  Numerical experiments on asymmetric graphs indicate that such reductions often produce DLAs of much smaller dimension, suggesting improved trainability. We also prove that any graph can be embedded into a slightly larger one (requiring only quadratic overhead) such that the standard reduced DLA coincides with the free reduced DLA, in most cases implying exponential dimension and irreducibility on the Hilbert space for reduced QAOA instances. These results establish symmetry-aware reduction as a principled tool for designing expressive and potentially trainable QAOA circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates how classical symmetries can be exploited to improve the QAOA algorithm's performance, particularly for the MaxCut problem.

In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values. In particular, we propose a two-step approach with the unique feature that after a variational approximation for a quantity is obtained in a first step, it can then be used to efficiently compute the exact result in a second step.

Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to local measurements. In this work, we study entanglement in such theories within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We show that the failure of tomographic locality leads to two qualitatively distinct forms of entanglement, which we term $\\textit{tomographically-local}$ entanglement and $\\textit{tomographically-nonlocal}$ entanglement. We analyze the operational consequences of this distinction, proving that tomographically-nonlocal entanglement is useless for Bell nonlocality, steering, and teleportation, but sufficient for dense coding and perfectly secure data hiding.

Decoherence explains how a pointer basis can be selected dynamically, but it does not by itself select a unique outcome. This motivates a neutral presentation of the main ontological options (unique-history, decohered multiplicity, agent-relative facticity, and a stochastic foundation with variable diffusion). We also note the relevance of the ``agency constraint'' argued by Adlam-McQueen-Waegell: in a strictly coherent, basis-unselected ``purely quantum'' regime, minimal agency fails due to no-cloning and linearity, which sharpens the role of classical resources for record-based processes. Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios then serve as a stress test, since they treat ``friends'' simultaneously as coherent quantum systems and as agents possessing stable records.

We introduce a quantum noise homogenization scheme that temporally coarse-grains non-Markovian, colored-noise driven quantum stochastic processes and connects them to their effective white-noise (Markovian) limits. Our approach uses a novel phase-space augmentation that maps the non-Markovian dynamics into a higher dimensional Markovian system and then applies a controlled perturbative coarse-graining scheme in the characteristic time scales of the noise. This allows an explicit analytical algorithm to derive effective Markovian generators with renormalized coefficients and enables imposing various physical constraints on them. We thus resolve the Ito-Stratonovich ambiguity for multiplicative colored noise driven quantum stochastic processes, wherein we show that their consistent Markovian limit corresponds to the Stratonovich convention with renormalized coefficients as well as Ito correction terms.

Moreover, we provide a characterization of the models of our formal theory, thus providing new insights in the study of hidden variable models of quantum theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u63a8\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u4e30\u5bcc\u91cf\u5b50\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution.

In review", "summary": "Feynman famously asserted that interference is the only real mystery in quantum mechanics (QM). It is concluded that the reason for this mystery, and thereby the related mysteries of complementarity, non-commutativity of observables, the uncertainty principle and violation of Bell's equality, is that the axioms of QM depend vitally on the continuum nature of Hilbert Space, deemed unphysical. We develop a theory of quantum physics - Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) - in which Hilbert Space is gravitationally discretised. The key to solving the mysteries of QM in RaQM is a number-theoretic property of the cosine function, concealed in QM when angles range over the continuum. This number-theoretic property describes mathematically the utter indivisibility of the quantum world and implies that the laws of physics are profoundly holistic. We contrast holism with nonlocality. In theories which embrace the continuum, the violation of Bell's inequality requires the laws of physics to be either nonlocal or not realistic; both incomprehensible concepts. By contrast, holism, as embodied in Mach's Principle or in the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor, is neither incomprehensible nor unphysical. As part of this, we solve the deepest mystery of all; why nature makes use of complex numbers.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper posits that the mysteries of quantum mechanics, like complementarity, non-commutativity, uncertainty principle, and Bell's inequality violations, stem from Hilbert Space's reliance on the continuum.

The asymmetry results from asymmetric coin operations, asymmetric initial states, and asymmetric polarization-dependent losses. By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop structure. By choosing an asymmetric initial state, both coin-position entanglement and delocalization are simultaneously enhanced under specific coin parameters. Moreover, we observe that with finite asymmetric polarization-dependent loss, the photon probability on the left side decreases significantly, while that on the right side increases and becomes more localized. Interestingly, under specific coin parameters, the entanglement and delocalization exhibit improved robustness against polarization-dependent loss.

For generic arrays, repeated measurements on one emitter drive the unmeasured TLEs into a nearly pure state with large overlap with the subradiant Dicke subspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u53cc\u6c34\u5e73\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff08TLE\uff09\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u9759\u9ed8\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u4e86\u4e00\u9636\u5b50\u8f90\u5c04\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u9759\u9ed8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5149 GHz \u95ed\u73af\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u81ea\u65cb\u53cc\u6c34\u5e73\u53d1\u5c04\u5668 (TLE) \u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u4e2a TLE \u7684\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u4e2a TLE \u7684\u591a\u6b21\u6001\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u4f59 TLE \u8fdb\u5165\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b50\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5806\u53e0\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6392\u5217\u7684 TLE \u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u4e2a TLE \u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u4e00\u9636\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u3002\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6392\u5217\u7684 TLE \u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u4e2a TLE \u591a\u6b21\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f7f\u5176\u4f59\u65e0\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684 TLE \u8fdb\u5165\u63a5\u8fd1\u7eaf\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5806\u53e0\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u5b50\u8f90\u5c04\u5355\u4e00\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684 Dick \u6a21\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u53cc\u6c34\u5e73\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u96c6\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u9759\u9ed8\u6001\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The local bound on nonlocal predictability is defined as the maximum probability with which one observer can correctly predict the other's measurement outcome prior to measurement. We show that product states always meet this bound, while all pure entangled states and some classically correlated states can exceed it. This demonstrates a nonlocal phenomenon since the predictability of measurement outcomes increases after the measurement. Perfect nonlocal predictability for arbitrary projective measurements occurs only for maximally entangled states among all pure states, underscoring their special role. Comparing pure entangled states with their dephased versions, we find that dephasing on one subsystem can enhance nonlocal predictability for a broad class of states and measurements - a counterintuitive, noise-induced advantage that vanishes for maximally entangled states under any projective measurement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5168\u77e5\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u9884\u6d4b\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51e0\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u5982\u7eaf\u6001\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u7248\u672c\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u7eaf\u6001\u4e0e\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7eaf\u6001\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u6001\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u4ec5\u5f53\u6001\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e14\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u7eaf\u6001\u624d\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8c\u7f8e\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u975e\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

These investigations show that HHG radiation is, in general, in a nonclassical state of light. However, the quantum optical treatment of HHG from topological nontrivial materials is missing. Here, we aim to address this gap in current knowledge and consider the quantum optical HHG response from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a finite chain of atoms with both a topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating phase, the latter supporting edge states. We find that HHG from both topological phases is squeezed at the band-gap frequency. Interestingly, while the harmonic spectrum discriminates the two topological phases of the system, the degree of squeezing only discriminates the phases for smaller chain lengths. We attribute this difference to a relative increase in overlap between bulk and edge states in the topological nontrivial phase for smaller systems.

Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion is generally used for realizing such sources, but requires costly implementation platforms with reduced versatility. Here, we explore the potentialities of Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM) in all-solid Silicon On Insulator (SOI) waveguides thanks to an experimentally validated model and propose designs ensuring the production of correlated photon pairs bridging the 3um-4um Mid-infrared band and Telecom C-band. Choosing a pump with a wavelength in the range 2100nm-2210nm and a pulse duration of 5ps, we quantitatively performed simulations targeting a probability of photon pair generation per pulse of 0.05, and we found realistic conditions of utilization (2cm-length straight waveguides, intra-modal Four Wave Mixing with the fundamental TE00 mode) with a pump peak power in between 9.2mW and 32mW.

Here, we demonstrate a real-time intermodal quantum key distribution field trial over an 18 km free-space link, connecting a remote terminal to an urban optical ground station equipped with a 40 cm-class telescope. An adaptive optics system, implementing direct wavefront sensing and high-order aberration correction, enables efficient single-mode fiber coupling and allows secure key generation of 200 bit/s using a compact state analyzer equipped with room-temperature detectors. We further validate through experimental data a turbulence-based model for predicting fiber coupling efficiency, providing practical design guidelines for future intermodal quantum networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u573a\u95f4\u5171\u4eab,\u7279\u522b\u662f\u572818\u516c\u91cc\u5916\u7684\u7a7a\u57df\u94fe\u63a5\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u63a5\u5165\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u6210\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\uff08QKD\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u5728\u5149\u7ea4\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6574\u5408\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001QKD\u5b9e\u65bd\u53d7\u5230\u5927\u6c14\u6e4d\u6d41\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce2\u524d\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5355\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u63a5\u5165\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001QKD\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u572818\u516c\u91cc\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u94fe\u63a5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001QKD\u7684\u573a\u95f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce2\u524d\u611f\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u5f62\u53d8\u7ea0\u6b63\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5355\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u5165\u7ad9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684 detectors\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86200 bit/s\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u901f\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u6c14\u6e4d\u6d41\u5bf9\u5149\u7ea4\u8026\u5408\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u572818\u516c\u91cc\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u94fe\u63a5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u6c14\u6e4d\u6d41\u5bf9\u5149\u7ea4\u63a5\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The dynamics is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on a curved spatial background and, when included, by minimal coupling to a magnetic vector potential incorporating an Aharonov--Bohm flux. After separation of variables, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial eigenvalue equation governed by an effective potential that combines torsion-induced Coulomb-like and centrifugal-like structures with magnetic/flux-dependent terms and optional model interactions. Because closed-form analytic solutions are not reliable over the parameter ranges required for systematic scans, we compute spectra and eigenfunctions numerically by formulating the radial equation as a self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville problem and solving it with a finite-difference discretization on a truncated radial domain, with explicit convergence control. We analyze four representative scenarios: (i) no external potential, (ii) Cornell-type confinement, (iii) Kratzer-type interaction, and (iv) the small-oscillation regime around the minimum of a Morse potential. We present systematic trends of the low-lying levels as functions of the torsion parameter, magnetic field, and azimuthal sector, and we show that geometric couplings alone can produce effective confinement even in the absence of an external interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u87ba\u65cb\u72b6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6807\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u5f84\u5411\u5916\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u53d8\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u7ef4\u5f84\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u51e0\u4f55\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u79bb\u53d8\u91cf\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u5f84\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u8026\u5408\u53ef\u72ec\u7acb\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u6548\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u56db\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u5206\u5e03\u89c4\u5f8b\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u80fd\u7ea7\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u7c92\u5b50\u675f\u7f1a\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}
