Comments are welcome", "summary": "We propose a class of periodically driven (Hermitian) modified bosonic Kitaev chains that effectively hosts rich nonHermitian Floquet topological phenomena. Two particular models are investigated in details as case studies. The first of these represents a minimal topologically nontrivial model in which nonHermitian skin effect, topological zero modes, and topological $π$ modes coexist. The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $π$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model. Our studies thus demonstrate the prospect of a periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chain as a starting point in exploring various nonHermitian Floquet topological phases through the lens of a Hermitian system."}

We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications."}

The most mature material platform is magnetically doped topological insulators. In these materials, precise quantization is limited to low temperatures, with the activation energy for dissipative transport typically in the range of 1 K. One potential source of dissipative transport is non-chiral edge states. These states are expected to be present in sufficiently thick samples. In this work, we perform extensive Hall and non-local resistance measurements in a Hall bar geometry at 2 K. By comparing 15 independent transport measurements to different transport models, we find that the system behavior is well-described by a simple continuum Ohm's law model. The addition of non-chiral edge states into the model does not significantly improve the fitting, and we conclude that there is not strong evidence for these states. We discuss the implications of our results for the prospect of high temperature quantized anomalous Hall effect in these materials."}

This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics."}

Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances.

However, the plate structure is easily damaged during long-term service or when it is impacted by foreign objects. Such a damage may lead to serious safety accidents.

However, when using beamforming or LSSC localization method to locate the damages on plate-like structures, there exists blind area. In this paper, by combining the beamforming and LSSC localization method, a fan-shaped sensor cluster is proposed through arranging five sensors in a fan shape, which can effectively reduce the blind areas. The positions of damages on the plate can be accurately detected by using two groups of fan-shaped sensor clusters and one sensor for transmitting the excitation signal. The feasibility of the fan-shaped sensor cluster localization method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments, and the results are compared with those obtained by using the T-shaped sensor cluster. The results show that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can more accurately identify the damages at different positions.

Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 10731] identifies localized groups of highly correlated contacts that mediate interactions between secondary structure elements. This framework proposes that allostery proceeds through a multistep process involving cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters, transmitted through rigid secondary structures. To demonstrate the validity and generality of the model, this Perspective employs extensive molecular dynamics simulations ($\\sim 1\\,$ms total simulation time) of four different photoswitchable PDZ domains and studies how different domains, ligands and perturbations influence both the contact clusters and their dynamical evolution. These analyses reveal several recurring clusters that represent shared flexible structural modules, such as loops connecting $β$-sheets, and show that the characteristic timescales of the nonequilibrium protein response can be directly associated with the motions of individual contact clusters. Thus, the dynamic decomposition of PDZ domains into contact clusters uncovers a modular, dynamics-based architecture that underlies and facilitates long-range allosteric communication."}

The detected proton peak was studied for 25 keV, 30 keV, and 35 keV incident protons on a set of detector segments and multiple cooling cycles over a one year period. Ionization losses were consistent with models of the detector dead layer with thicknesses less than 100nm. The detected proton peak was stable within the uncertainty from energy calibration (0.2 keV). The rise times of detector pulses from $^{109}$Cd and $^{113}$Sn conversion electron sources were used to extract the impurity density profile and establish a precise model for the detector timing response. The observed impurity density profile varied from $(2 \\pm 2) \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the center to $(26 \\pm 2) \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the edge. This impurity density profile was then used to characterize systematic effects in proton time-of-flight measurements due to detector pulse-shape effects; the resultant proton timing systematic uncertainties were below 0.3 ns, which is sufficient for the Nab experiment."}

Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological \"pins\" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales.

A plastic scintillating fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact, high-resolution solution.

To address this challenge, this work presents a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the selection of suitable diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. Electronic tests show that the proposed design exhibits low crosstalk among electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range spanning a few to several hundred photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further demonstrate that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to direct readout. These results verify that the proposed method offers a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems."}

Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \\textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\\gg L$."}

The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles. These results reveal that dissipative coupling cooperativity carries a clear physical meaning and serves as a key parameter for controlling phase transitions. Dissipative coupling offers an alternative paradigm for tailoring light matter interactions, paving the way for advances in both information processing and quantum technologies."}

Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT."}

This is borne out in the mathematics, where mixed state algorithms have always required more sophisticated techniques to design and analyze than pure state algorithms. We present a new approach to tomography demonstrating that, contrary to this belief, state-of-the-art mixed state tomography follows easily and naturally from pure state algorithms.\n  We analyze the following strategy: given $n$ copies of an unknown state $ρ$, convert them into copies of a purification $|ρ\\rangle$; run a pure state tomography algorithm to produce an estimate of $|ρ\\rangle$; and output the resulting estimate of $ρ$. The purification subroutine was recently discovered via the \"acorn trick\" of Tang, Wright, and Zhandry. With this strategy, we obtain the first tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal in all parameters. For a rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state, it uses $n = O((rd + \\log(1/δ))/\\varepsilon)$ samples to output an estimate which is $\\varepsilon$-close in fidelity with probability at least $1-δ$. This algorithm also uses poly$(n)$ gates, making it the first gate-efficient tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal even in terms of the dimension $d$ alone. Moreover, with this method we recover essentially all results on mixed state tomography, including its applications to tomography with limited entanglement, classical shadows, and quantum metrology. Our proofs are simple, closing the gap in conceptual difficulty between mixed and pure tomography. Our results also clarify the role of entangled measurement in mixed state tomography: the only step of the algorithm which requires entanglement across copies is the purification step, suggesting that, for tomography, the reason entanglement is useful is for consistent purification."}

Embedding this theory in an FLRW background, we derive the corresponding torsion-modified Friedmann equations and analyze their solutions across radiation and matter-dominated epochs. The commonly assumed power law form $a(t)=βt^α$ is shown to generate multiple solution branches, many of which can be considered to be 'unphysical', atleast to hold true globally, for all times. A hybrid solution, $a(t)=Ct^αe^{Dt^β}$ emerges in the special case $g_1=0$, where the quadratic Riemann-Cartan term vanishes. For $g_1\\not=0$, the equations become nonlinear, precluding closed-form analytic solutions. These findings highlight the limitations of the power-law approximation and identify the restricted conditions under which torsion can coherently drive cosmic expansion."}

Neutron-scattering experiments and first-principles calculations have revealed an unexpected double-zigzag (dZZ) magnetically ordered ground state, whose microscopic origin remains under active debate. Here, we investigate the emergence of such dZZ phase in a ferro-antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, using a generalized Schwinger boson mean-field theory ($g$-SBMFT) that treats ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions on equal footing. Based on $g$-SBMFT and exact-diagonalization (ED) techniques, we find that the dZZ is selected by an order-by-disorder mechanism in a narrow $J_3/|J_1|$ range, in agreement with recent density-matrix renormalization-group calculations. The magnetic excitation spectra within the dZZ phase displays a distinctive smearing out in momentum space due to quantum fluctuations which may be probed through inelastic neutron-scattering experiments."}

Because standard OT configurations do not provide direct access to the axial position, axial detection typically relies on temporal fluctuations in forward-scattered optical power to infer the position of the particle. This approach generally assumes a linear-response regime in which the signal arises from the interference between the forward scattered and the nonscattered optical fields; however, under certain conditions, the backward-scattered contribution becomes non-negligible, leading to deviations from the linear response. Here, we present a simple yet comprehensive model for axial detection in standard OT while explicitly accounting for the backward-scattered field. Together with experimental validation, this framework neatly explains the standing-wave response observed when the backward-scattered field interferes with the nonscattered and the forward-scattered components, enabling accurate estimation of trap stiffness and particle diffusion under more general conditions. This work deepens our understanding of the phenomenology observed in real optical-tweezers measurements and extends their capabilities to conditions where standard approaches fail."}

We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes.

An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\\hbar$ units. Even as $\\hbar \\rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition. This implies that Bohr's correspondence principle is not fundamental, but a consequence of practical limitations. We outline an implementation with a variety of qubits (superconducting qubits, spins in semiconductors, and Rydberg atoms) coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator, and - via the corresponding noise analysis - find that violation of MR is detectable up to $100$ qubits via current technology."}

How to efficiently test their quantumness at these scales? We show that the violation of Macrorealism (MR), being the fact that classical systems possess definite properties that can be measured without disturbances, provide a fruitful avenue to this aim. The No Disturbance Condition (NDC) - the equality used here to test MR - can be violated by two consecutive parity measurements on $N$ qubits and found to be independent of $N$ under ideal conditions. However, realistic noisy QCs show a quantum-to-classical transition as $N$ increases, giving a foundationally-motivated scalable benchmarking metric. Two methods are formulated to implement this metric: one that involves a mid-circuit measurement, probing the irreversible collapse of the wavefunction, in contrast to the reversible entanglement generated in the other. Both methods are designed to be clumsiness-loophole free: the unwanted classical disturbances are negligible within statistical error. Violation of MR is detected on a IBM QC up to $N = 38$ qubits, increasing $N$ by one order of magnitude over best known results of MR. Two QCs are benchmarked using the proposed NDC metric, showing a three-fold improvement in their quantumness from one generation to the next."}

However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM).

Each module or trap can perform only one operation at a time, resulting in low intra-trap parallelism, but there is no restriction on operations happening on independent traps, enabling high inter-trap parallelism. Unlike their superconducting counterparts, the design space for QCCDs is relatively flexible and can be explored beyond current grid designs. In particular, current grid-based architectures significantly limit the performance of many promising, high-rate codes such as HGP codes and BB codes, suffering from numerous trap to trap ``roadblocks\", forcing serialization and destroying the inherent parallelism of these codes.. Many of these codes are highly parallelizable, meaning that with appropriate hardware layouts and matching software schedules, execution latency can be reduced. Faster execution, in turn, reduces error accumulation from decoherence and heating, ultimately improving code performance when mapped to realistic hardware. To address this, we propose Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign that departs from traditional 2D grids in favor of a flexible ring topology, where ancilla qubits move in lockstep. Cyclone eliminates roadblocks, bounds total movement, and enables high levels of parallelism, resulting in up to ~4$\\times$ speedup in execution times.

Employing this modified equipartition law of energy, we derive the Friedmann equations in Verlinde's entropic gravity. We find a maximum energy density at the beginning of the Universe. Remarkably, this feature emerges not only for positive GUP parameter but also for negative GUP parameter. From the initial acceleration, we deduce that the negative GUP parameter is more preferable. We also obtain maximum Hubble parameter from the first Friedmann equation, indicating a universe without initial singularity. Moreover, we compute the Kretschmann curvature scalar, again indicating a non-singular universe. Interestingly, we find that GUP-modified Friedmann equations share some similarities with braneworld cosmolgy where the quadratic term in energy density appears. We also compute the deceleration parameter. Finally, we revisit the gravitational baryogenesis and show that the GUP-modified equipartition law of energy provides a mechanism for generating baryon asymmetry. Moreover, we constrain the GUP parameter from observations."}

Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed.

Conventional approaches--such as chemical doping, lattice strain, or external gating--offer robust stability but remain confined to the quasi-static regime, far from the intrinsic femto- to picosecond dynamics that govern many-body interactions. Here, using cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, we realize dynamic bandgap engineering in the anisotropic topological insulator $α$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with unprecedented micro-electron-volt ($μ$eV) precision. The exceptional sensitivity arises from the cooperative action of long-lived topological carriers, stabilized by restricted bulk-to-edge scattering phase space, together with symmetry-resolved coherent phonons that modulate inter-chain hopping. These channels jointly modify Coulomb screening and interband transitions, enabling both gradual and oscillatory control of the electronic structure. Supported by first-principles and tight-binding theory, we further demonstrate a dual-pump coherent control strategy for continuous, mode-selective tuning of electronic energies with $μ$eV accuracy. This framework paves the way for ultrafast on-demand band-structure engineering, pointing toward new frontiers in quantum optoelectronics, precision measurement in molecular and biological systems, and attosecond control of matter."}

The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution."}

This paper presents a numerical study of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) hybrid III-V-on-silicon lasers, analyzing design trade-offs and optimization strategies based on supermode theory. The III-V section of the design incorporates InAs/(Al)GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which offer improved temperature insensitivity at the cost of more complex III-V/Si optical coupling, due to the high refractive index of (Al)GaAs. Consequently, many current laser designs rely on silicon waveguides with a thickness exceeding 220 nm, which helps coupling but limits their compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. To address this challenge, we perform detailed simulations focusing on 220-nm-thick silicon waveguides. We first examine how the mode profiles jointly depend on the silicon waveguide dimensions and the geometry and composition of the III-V stack. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel epitaxial design that enables effective III-V/Si coupling, with the optical mode strongly confined within the III-V waveguide in the gain section and efficiently transferred to the silicon waveguide in the passive sections. Moreover, the final design is shown to be robust to fabrication-induced deviations from nominal parameters."}

These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.\n  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of \"loop removal\". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time.

Most theoretical works to date rely on the brute-force exact diagonalization which is limited to the one partially occupied band. In this work, we present strong evidence that the effect of higher lying bands cannot be ignored due to strong interband interactions. To tackle these effects, we introduce a non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, originally developed for problems in quantum chemistry. We apply this methodology to twisted MoTe2 at fractional hole fillings of ν = 1/3 and 2/3 across a spectrum of twist angles. Our results show that at ν = 1/3, the many-body excitation energy gaps are substantially reduced compared to the one-band treatment. For ν = 2/3, we find that the dynamic correlations stemming from interband interactions stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, consistent with the experimental findings. By examining the correlated orbitals and their single-particle topological features, we demonstrate that this stabilization at higher twist angles arises predominantly from the dynamic correlations, rather than conditions on the single-particle quantum geometric tensor."}

Stage II propagates the field in water via the angular-spectrum method and applies the same equations across space. Normal dispersion reverses the trend: the chirp-only plasma density decreases as chirp grows, negative chirp remains less detrimental, and suppression is strongest for longer FTL pulses (e.g., 80 fs) due to dispersion-induced temporal spreading and spatio-temporal desynchronization. This study separates spectral-phase effects from bandwidth and intensity, yields testable predictions for water jets, and provides a foundation for future experiments and self-consistent propagation models."}

Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Neél order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis."}

We develop a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying this resource for large families of binary measurements, including Pauli observables on multi-qubit systems and $k$-body Majorana observables on $n$-mode fermionic systems. To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lovász number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lovász number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families. Finally, we identify structural conditions under which the robustness is determined by a simple function of the graph's maximum degree and the number of vertices and edges, and show that such extremal cases occur only when combinatorial structures such as Hadamard, conference or weighing matrices exist."}

Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector.

Here we propose theoretically and illustrate experimentally a different approach to the construction of HOTIs. This approach utilizes lattices with incomplete unit cells and achieves localized modes of topological origin across a broader parameter space. When truncation disrupts translational symmetry by cutting through the interior of multiple unit cells, boundary modes in our system emerge for both trivial and topologically nontrivial positions of the Wannier centers. We link these modes to the appearance of fractional Wannier centers. We also demonstrate that linear boundary states give rise to rich families of stable solitons bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity. Multiple types of thresholdless topological solitons with different internal symmetries are observed in waveguide arrays with triangular configurations featuring incomplete unit cells for any dimerization of waveguide spacings. Our results expand the family of HOTIs and pave the way for the observation of boundary states with different symmetries."}

We establish a benchmark by solving the exact NESS density matrix for a generic Bloch system coupled to a featureless fermionic bath. Our exact $Γ^0$ conductivity decomposes into two parts: (i) a geometric contribution, $σ^{\\text{geo}}$, whose form recovers the intraband quantum metric dipole ($\\sim\\partial_k g$), providing an exact derivation that clarifies inconsistencies in the literature, and (ii) a novel, purely kinetic contribution, $σ^{\\text{kin}} \\propto v^3 f^{(4)}_0$, which is absent when dissipation is modeled by white-noise disorder (e.g., a constant-$Γ$ Green's function model).

We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $α$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \\emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $ζ\\leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios."}

The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions.

Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion.

By measuring the THz waves from argon atoms ionized by the two-color fields, and by precisely controlling their relative phase and ellipticity, we observe intensity-dependent rotations of the THz polarization direction.

In heterostructures where a few degrees twist angle is imposed between the MoSe and WSe crystallographic axes, we show that a continuous moiré lattice is realized across areas close to the optical diffraction limit. In such regions, the photoluminescence reduces to a few narrow-band lines only, energetically distributed consistently with the geometry of the moiré lattice.

An application of this result to black hole (BH) physics allows one to estimate a new quantum limit to general relativity. It is indeed shown that, for every real Schwarzschild BH, the maximum gravitational acceleration occurs, without becoming infinite, when the Schwarzschild radial coordinate reaches the gravitational radius. This means that quantum corrections to general relativity become necessary not at the Planck scale, as the majority of researchers in the field think, but at the Schwarzschild scale, in agreement with recent interesting results in the literature. In other words, the quantum nature of physics, which in this case manifests itself through the GUP, appears to prohibit the existence of real singularities, in this current case forbiddiing the gravitational acceleration of a Schwarzschild BH from becoming infinite."}

However, conventional tunable laser systems often rely on mechanical actuation, which limits their tuning speed, stability, and repeatability. Alternative tuning methods, such as adjusting the temperature of the gain medium or the injection current, are either slow or suffer from unwanted coupling between frequency and intensity. Electro-optic modulators implemented after the laser offer fast frequency tunability but these components are bulky and prone to high insertion losses. Here, we introduce an external cavity semiconductor laser that achieves ultrafast frequency and amplitude tunability within a compact footprint without any moving parts. The laser employs a resonant electro-optic metasurface as the external mirror, providing narrowband feedback that enables simultaneous single-mode operation and voltage-controlled tuning across a wide range of currents. Leveraging a narrow linewidth design, we demonstrate mode-hop-free linear frequency tuning with rates of up to 70 THz/s, and frequency excursions reaching 110 MHz under a 10 V peak RF drive, clearly surpassing rates attainable through mechanical actuation. Moreover, by biasing the laser near its threshold, our platform enables intensity modulation with an efficiency above 100% at a peak voltage of 4 V. These results highlight the platform's potential for applications requiring high-speed and mode-hop-free tunable lasers, such as free-space optical communication, laser ranging, and high-resolution spectroscopy."}

By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles.

Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT."}

The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \\ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change. This bound can be surpassed when qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings to the baths are introduced. Numerical results for the interacting two-qubit system reveal a non-trivial role of the interaction between qubits and the coupling between the qubits and the baths in the behavior of the dissipated power.

Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Neél order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis."}

Our method can numerically upper bound the failure rate of a circuit in the presence of flags, and fine tune the fault-tolerance of the flags in order to reach this bound. We assume the flags can have an increased fault-tolerance as a result of applying surface QECs to the gates interacting with them. We use circuit level depolarizing noise to evaluate the effectiveness of these flags in revealing the absence of the high-weight stabilizers. Medusa reduces the cost of quantum-error-correction (QEC) because the underlying circuit has a lower failure rate. We benchmark our approach using structured quantum circuits representative of ripple-carry adders. In particular, our flag scheme demonstrates that for adder-like circuits, the failure rate of large-scale implementations can be lowered to fit the failure rates of smaller-scale circuits. We show numerically that a slight improvement in the local fault-tolerance of the flag-qubits can lead to a reduction in the overall failure rate of the entire quantum circuit."}

In this work, I show that a $(d+1)$-dimensional free-fermion model with quadratic band touching exhibits spatial conformal invariance, and that its equal-time ground-state correlation functions are exactly captured by the $d$-dimensional symplectic fermion theory. I establish this correspondence by constructing explicit mappings between physical fermionic operators and the fields of the symplectic fermion theory. I further explore the implications of this correspondence in two spatial dimensions, where the symplectic fermion theory is a logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge $c=-2$. In the corresponding $(2+1)$-dimensional systems, I identify anyonic excitations originating from the underlying symplectic fermion theory, even though the Hamiltonian is gapless. Transporting these excitations along non-contractible loops generates transitions among topologically degenerate ground states, in close analogy with those in topologically ordered phases. Moreover, the action of a $2π$ rotation on these excitations is represented by a Jordan block, reflecting the logarithmic character of the associated conformal field theory."}

Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Neél order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis."}

Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance."}

Variational quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving problems in these domains. However, the design of the quantum circuit ansatz remains a challenge. Of particular interest is developing a method to generate circuits for any given instance of a problem, not merely a circuit tailored to a specific instance of the problem. To this end, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learning a problem-dependent quantum circuit mapping, which outputs a circuit for the ground state of a Hamiltonian from a given family of parameterized Hamiltonians. For quantum chemistry, our RL framework takes as input a molecule and a discrete set of bond distances, and it outputs a bond-distance-dependent quantum circuit for arbitrary bond distances along the potential energy curve. The inherently non-greedy approach of our RL method contrasts with existing greedy approaches to adaptive, problem-tailored circuit constructions. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the four-qubit and six-qubit lithium hydride molecules, as well as an eight-qubit H$_4$ chain. Our learned circuits are interpretable in a physically meaningful manner, thus paving the way for applying RL to the development of novel quantum circuits for the ground states of large-scale molecular systems."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We propose a class of periodically driven (Hermitian) modified bosonic Kitaev chains that effectively hosts rich nonHermitian Floquet topological phenomena. Two particular models are investigated in details as case studies. The first of these represents a minimal topologically nontrivial model in which nonHermitian skin effect, topological zero modes, and topological $π$ modes coexist. The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $π$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model. Our studies thus demonstrate the prospect of a periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chain as a starting point in exploring various nonHermitian Floquet topological phases through the lens of a Hermitian system."}

The scheme relies on an energy cutoff $Λ$ which removes the quasi-resonant couplings, enabling the dressing of the particles into quasiparticles via a unitary transformation. The dynamics of the quasiparticles is then restricted to low-energy transitions and is fully determined by an effective Hamiltonian which unifies the Landau interaction function $f$ and the collision amplitude in a single amplitude $\\mathcal{A}$ regularized by $Λ$. Our effective theory captures all the low-energy physics of Fermi fluids that support Landau quasiparticles, from the equation of state to the transport properties, both in the normal and in the superfluid phase. We apply it to an atomic Fermi gas with contact interaction to compute the speed of zero sound in function of the scattering length $a$. We also recover the Gork'ov-Melik Barkhudarov correction to the superfluid gap and critical temperature as a direct consequence of the dressing of particles into Landau quasiparticles."}

Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.\n  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of \"loop removal\". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time. This gives us a high-level, intuitive graphical language that retains a flexibility to handle changing graph structures, and thus we argue positions the PSC as the new definitive language for canonical LQG.\n  Furthermore, we investigate the possibility for a matrix-like normal form for spin networks deriving from a novel perspective of the PSC in terms of W-nodes."}

We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula."}

In the PT symmetric phase. interference is ultrasensitive to coupling strength, yielding sharp bunching antibunching switches. In the PT broken phase. it becomes robust oscillation free and propagation independent with coincidence probability stably tunable via coupling.

We microscopically analyze the phase boundaries using the non-Bloch momentum while the off-critical (critical) phases are directly associated with the gapped (gapless) nature of the non-Bloch bands that we derive from the characteristic equation using the gauge freedom. The non-Bloch momentum accurately reflects the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) explaining the winding number profile under open boundary conditions. We examine the adiabatic dynamics to promote the concept of adiabatic charge transport in a non-Hermitian scenario justifying the BBC in spatio-temporal Bott index and non-Bloch Chern number. Once the non-Bloch bands experience no (a) gap-closing during the evolution of time, quantized flow of is preserved (broken).

The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution."}
