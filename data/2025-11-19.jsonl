This metastable state is part of a strongly coupled opposite-parity doublet. Using optically detected microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, we determine the approximately 1.12 cm$^{-1}$ doublet spacing for the five stable bosonic isotopes of Dy with kHz-level accuracy. From the shift of the microwave transition frequency in low electric fields (below 150 V/cm) and from optical spectra in high electric fields (up to 150 kV/cm), a reduced transition dipole moment of 7.65 $\\pm$ 0.05 Debye between the doublet states is extracted. In high electric fields the doublet interacts with a third state at 17727 cm$^{-1}$, that connects to the ground state via an electric-dipole transition. The three-state Stark interaction enables preparation of Dy atoms in the metastable state via single-photon excitation from the ground state."}

The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $Ω/Λ$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision."}

We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures."}

Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \\textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\\sim 6.8$ to $\\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\\sim 10^{5}~\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \\textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter."}

Several OFMs are constructed for two Poincare surfaces of section using forwards and backwards symplectic integration to assign each initial condition a channel of origin and fate. Our results reproduce the highly symmetric lambda = 1.0 patterns reported in Hillebrand et al. (Phys. Rev.

Long-time integrations show a reduction of trapped regions with boundaries that exhibit self-similarity under deep zoom, revealing fractal-like structures. High-resolution OFMs and LD gradient maps uncover lobe dynamics and manifold structures that govern transport, showing near-perfect alignment between LD ridges and OFM boundaries."}

Thin films of the PIM-1 were exposed to 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and their steady-state absorption and emission spectra measured. For comparison, the response of PIM-1 to non-explosive molecules such as benzene (BN) was also explored. Complementary electronic-structure calculations were used to predict absorption and emission spectra and to determine binding energies for the PIM-1-analyte complexes. The calculations agree well with experiment and reveal that association of nitroaromatic analyte molecules with PIM-1 alters the energy levels and the arrangements of frontier orbitals, indicating significant molecular interactions. Calculations show that the electronic properties and photo-excited electron transfer can be described by interaction with a single repeat unit of the polymer. The molecular binding, however, involves interaction with at least three repeat units, with the DNT or TNT molecule binding into a pocket in the contorted structure of the microporous polymer. Together, the experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that PIM-1 is a promising platform for selective nitroaromatic detection and provide molecular design principles that could improve sensitivity and selectivity in future sensor materials."}

Ranging from moiré and super-moiré materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $α$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $α$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena."}

The confined, high-density environment of genetic material within the capsid strongly suggests that quantum confinement effects play a significant, yet unexplored, role in viral processes. This study introduces a novel quantum approach using Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SQM) to investigate the quantum confinement effects on viruses. In this paper, the viral capsid environment is modeled using the Pariacoto virus, a model system well-suited for this analysis due to its specific structural properties. The findings reveal that quantum effects are not merely marginal but essential for understanding key processes inside the capsid, providing new insights beyond the scope of classical physics."}

Here, we report the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of CrOCl monolayer films and nanosheets that exhibit excellent air stability. The CrOCl morphology is tunable, ranging from two-dimensional nanosheets to three-dimensional flower-like structures, with lateral sizes ranging from several microns to continuous monolayer films. Structural characterization confirms the materials composition and high crystalline quality. Furthermore, magnetic measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, reveal a Néel temperature for CrOCl of ~14 K.

In the Newman-Penrose formulation, the twist $\\text{Im}(ρ)$ is sourced by a twist potential sitting in the transverse null dyad $(m,\\bar{m})$, while in the metric formulation this potential arises from $g_{ra}\\neq0$. We explain how to arrange and solve the Einstein equations for such generalized line elements, thereby providing an extension of the Bondi hierarchy to asymptotically-flat spacetimes with non-vanishing twist. We work out the twisting generalizations of all the well-known features pertaining to asymptotically-flat spacetimes in Bondi gauge, such as the solution space, the flux-balance laws, the asymptotic symmetries, and the transformation laws. The twist potential has a natural Carrollian interpretation as an Ehresmann connection, and gives rise to Carroll boosts as extra asymptotic symmetries. One of the advantages of the Bondi gauge with non-vanishing twist is that it allows to write algebraically special solutions in a manifestly finite radial expansion, and with a repeated principal null direction such that $Ψ_0=Ψ_1=0$. This is in particular the case for the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution. The asymptotic symmetries of algebraically special solutions also have a finite radial expansion, which enables to study the supertranslated Schwarzschild solution and its charges quite straightforwardly. We expect that these results will find applications in the development of flat holography for algebraically special solutions and in the study of their perturbations. We also study an analogue of the twist in three-dimensional spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant, and find an 8-dimensional solution space which encompasses and generalizes the existing results in the literature."}

Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model."}

Here, we employ a small system consisting of a combination of covalent and van der Waals bonds for our studies, namely N2Ar dimers. We use synchrotron radiation to site-selectively enable the charge transfer processes and perform a coincidence measurement of the resulting electrons and ions. In combination with ab initio calculations, this approach enables a step-by-step tracking of the charge transfer and fragmentation dynamics. We find that ultrafast structural evolution of the dimer can trigger a second CT, thereby opening complex reaction pathways, in which electrons transfer back and forth between Ar and N2, and nonadiabatic transitions occur twice through conical intersections. These results demonstrate that multiple CT-induced transitions, particularly in such a simple dimer system, provide benchmark insights into the mechanisms of nonadiabatic reactions in complex natural systems."}

Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \\emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \\emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \\emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \\(T_1 = 50~μ\\mathrm{s}\\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \\(\\sim 3\\!-\\!4\\times\\) longer \\(T_1\\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy.

This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $α$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $α$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $α$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $α$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $α$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $α$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases."}

The process begins with 3D scanning of the anterior knee surface of human subjects, followed by extracting the corresponding skin deformation between two joint angles in terms of longitudinal strain and Poisson's ratio. In parallel, a machine learning model is constructed using extensive simulation data from experimentally calibrated finite element analysis. This model employs Gaussian Process (GP) regression to relate kirigami cut lengths to the resulting longitudinal strain and Poisson's ratio. With an R2 score of 0.996, GP regression outperforms other models in predicting kirigami's large deformations. Finally, an inverse design approach based on the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is used to generate kirigami patch designs that replicate the in-plane skin deformation observed from the knee scans. This pipeline was applied to three human subjects, and the resulting kirigami knee patches were fabricated using rapid laser cutting, requiring only a business day from knee scanning to kirigami patch delivery. The low-cost, personalized kirigami patches successfully conformed to over 75 percent of the skin area across all subjects, establishing a foundation for a wide range of wearable devices. The study demonstrates this potential through an impact-resistant kirigami foam patch, which not only conforms to dynamic knee motion but also provides joint protection against impact. Finally, the proposed design and fabrication framework is generalizable and can be extended to other deforming body surfaces, enabling the creation of personalized wearables such as protective gear, breathable adhesives, and body-conformable electronics."}

Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model."}

Numerical calculations based on the Kubo formula reveal that the magnitude of the nonmagnetic-driven magnetoelectric response reaches a maximum at an apex angle of $θ\\approx 0.6π$. To clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior, we construct a low-energy effective Hamiltonian by projecting onto the $s$-orbital subspace and demonstrate that the polarity induced by the V-shaped geometry manifests as an effective spin--orbit interaction. An analytical derivation of the Green's function shows that the geometric effect appears as a $T$-matrix contribution, reflecting the local breaking of translational symmetry at the V-shaped edge. Furthermore, by employing a multipole-basis representation, we identify the selection rules that govern the magnetoelectric tensor and reveal that the coupling between the effective spin--orbit interaction and the orbital angular momentum generated across the apex plays an essential role. The resulting angular dependence, $\\sinθ\\sin{θ/2}$, peaks at $θ= 2\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.608π$, in good agreement with the numerical results. We also analyze a ferromagnetic V-shaped model including the Zeeman interaction and show that the magnetic-driven magnetoelectric response originates from the spin magnetization induced by the coupling between the electric-field--driven charge-potential gradient and the Zeeman term. These findings demonstrate that the V-shaped geometry gives rise to distinct magnetoelectric mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry and provide a microscopic framework for understanding shape-induced multipole phenomena in mesoscopic and bulk systems."}

However, disorder presents a failure mechanism that can destroy topological in-gap states. Here, we investigate a disordered two-dimensional polariton lattice and employ the spectral localizer framework to define a real-space topological index rooted in crystalline spatial symmetries. This framework enables direct real-space mapping of topology beyond conventional momentum-space classifications, confirming the presence of corner and edge modes in this generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Furthermore, it can directly quantify topological protection of a state. We leverage the versatility of our platform to experimentally realize normally distributed, random disorder and find that the corner states persist until the spectral gap closes. Experimentally, this corresponds to a disorder strength of approximately one quarter of the spectral gap. The spectral localizer accurately identifies the disorder strength at which the bandgap closes, establishing the framework as a predictive tool for every finite size system. Our results broaden the design principles for higher-order topological insulators and open the way towards imple menting disorder-resilient devices for robust lasing, light-routing, and quantum computation."}

It is almost isotropic to the field and current directions, contrary to the known mechanisms such as giant magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly. The proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is strong in a wide class of the layered AFM-ordered semimetals.

In practice, we achieve this by covering the spacetime manifold with patches and localizing in each patch. We derive a general formula for the on-shell action that depends on topological data only and can be used without a detailed knowledge of the solution. Our final result is relevant for the physically interesting examples of multi-center black holes, black rings and black lenses, topological solitons and Euclidean black saddles.

To find a new way to understand classical magnetism, in this work, the displacement current is first decomposed into a localized internal part and an external field component by developing a discal regularization over the dipole distribution. Due to a surprising cancellation of the electric current by the internal displacement current, the magnetic field in the Coulomb gauge can be reformulated, in terms of the external component of the displacement current, as an instantaneous Biot-Savart law. The new expression allows for a reinterpretation of the generation of magnetic fields, viewing it as a magnetic effect related to the external displacement current, rather than directly to the electric current. The consistency of the Biot-Savart law with the Ampère-Maxwell law is thus confirmed, eliminating a dogged dispute in history. This result offers a potential recognition of the displacement current enigma. The regularization method is also applied to the polarization model to develop and refine the Clausius-Mossotti equation within the special Wigner-Seitz primitive-cell regularization."}

CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices."}

TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours.

Within the optical domain, light evolution in a nonlinear multimode environment presents a formidable problem, as its chaotic evolution often hinders predictive insights. Recently, an optical thermodynamic framework has been put forward that, in a systematic manner, can not only predict but also harness the intricate behavior of these systems. In this work, by deploying entropic principles, we demonstrate a counterintuitive optical process in which light, launched into any input port of a judiciously designed nonlinear array, universally channels into a tightly localized ground state, a response that is completely unattainable in linear conservative arrangements. This phenomenon arises from the interplay between lattice structure and the way the kinetic and nonlinear Hamiltonian components unfold, leading to two optical thermal processes: a Joule-Thomson-like expansion followed by mode thermalization. Experimentally, this effect is demonstrated in properly configured nonlinear time-synthetic mesh lattices, where the optical temperature approaches near zero, causing light to condense at a single spot, regardless of the initial excitation position. The effect demonstrated here opens new avenues for applying the principles of optical thermodynamics in realizing novel optical functionalities, such as all-optical beam steering, multiplexing, and nonlinear beam shaping in high-power regimes, while also offering a greater understanding of the remarkable physics of light-matter interactions in multimode nonlinear systems."}

Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior.

However, neutrons are notoriously difficult to capture due to their absence of charge, and only a handful of isotopes have a sufficient neutron cross-section. Meanwhile, commercially available $^3$He gas filled proportional counters suffer from depleting $^3$He feedstocks and complex device structures. In this work, we explore the potential of a carborane containing conjugated polymer ($o$CbT$_2$-NDI) as a thermal neutron detector. The natural abundance of $^{10}$B in such a polymer enables intrinsic thermal neutron capture of the material, making it the first demonstration of an organic semiconductor with such capabilities. In addition, we show that thermal neutron detection can be achieved also by adding a $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitiser additive to the analogous carborane-free polymer PNDI(2OD)2T, whereas unsensitised PNDI(2OD)2T control devices only respond to the fast neutron component of the radiation field. This approach allows us to disentangle the fast and thermal neutron responses of the devices tested and compare the relative performance of the two approaches to thermal neutron detection. Both the carborane containing and the $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitised devices displayed enhancement due to thermal neutrons, above that of the unsensitised polymer. The detector response is found to be linear with flux up to $1.796\\,\\times\\,10^7\\,$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ n$_{th}\\bar{v}$ and saturates at high drive biases. This study demonstrates the viability of carboranyl polymers as neutron detectors, highlights the inherent chemical tuneability of organic semiconductors, and opens the possibility of their application to a number of different low-cost, scalable, and easily processable detector technologies."}

Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\\rm eff}(ω)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $γ$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data.

Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral \"windmill\" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices."}

We describe a concrete example in which the vortex solutions that are realised in a prototypical pseudo-Hermitian field theory exhibit a novel metastability, despite the model parameters residing within the naively stable regime of exact antilinear symmetry of the vacuum theory. This instability is identified analytically and confirmed through numerical simulations, and it arises from the small breaking of the underlying antilinear symmetry of the pseudo-Hermitian theory due to the presence of the topological defect. This leads to spacetime-dependent parameters in the equations of motion governing fluctuations around the vortex, inducing non-trivial exceptional-point structures and complex frequencies within their spectrum. Aside from offering intriguing possibilities for cosmology, this result serves to illustrate the ability to produce long-lived metastable configurations in pseudo-Hermitian field theories of relevance beyond cosmology and high energy physics."}

Ranging from moiré and super-moiré materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $α$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $α$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena."}

In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave\" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three."}

In this work, the concept of \"temporal taper\", the temporal counterpart of a conventional spatial taper with a nearly full-band antireflection feature and good compatibility with gradual time-varying components, has been experimentally realized. A 1D temporal metamaterial base on voltage-controlled varactors has been designed experimentally validated. The temporal taper based broadband antireflection exempts the system from spatial matching insertions, and enables agile impedance matching for various terminal loads, positioning it as a promising approach in future photonic systems."}

For certain structured quantum generative models, however, expectation values of local observables can be efficiently computed on a classical computer, enabling fully classical training without quantum gradient evaluations. Although training is classically efficient, sampling from these circuits is still believed to be classically hard, so inference must be carried out on a quantum device, potentially yielding a computational advantage. In this work, we introduce Fermionic Born Machines as an example of such classically trainable quantum generative models. The model employs parameterized magic states and fermionic linear optical (FLO) transformations with learnable parameters. The training exploits a decomposition of the magic states into Gaussian operators, which permits efficient estimation of expectation values. Furthermore, the specific structure of the ansatz induces a loss landscape that exhibits favorable characteristics for optimization. The FLO circuits can be implemented, via fermion-to-qubit mappings, on qubit architectures to sample from the learned distribution during inference. Numerical experiments on systems up to 160 qubits demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and training framework."}

Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations have been separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 in these RB12 with magnetic RE ions is attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the B12 complexes, which depends crucially on the RE-ion cage space and is compared with the same effect found in the non-magnetic LuB12 and ZrB12. It was shown that non-equilibrium (hot) electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and portion of Drude-type carriers changes by 20-40% in these compounds with unstable boron lattice. Strong renormalization of the infrared response is observed in Tm1-xYbxB12 solid solutions with metal-insulator transition (MIT) and is discussed in terms of localized collective modes caused by Yb-ion valence instability.

In this work, we introduce a controlled violation of this principle by inserting a parametric controlled-unitary gate that enables a tunable leakage of quantum information from the black hole interior to the exterior, while preserving global unitarity. By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon. These features mimic quantum-gravity-induced effects such as remnant formation and horizon permeability, suggesting that minimal deviations from classical causality can leave long-lived imprints on black hole information dynamics."}

We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $α$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $α$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $α$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $α$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $α$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $α$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases."}

The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter.

Quantum simulation algorithms may require the ability to control the time evolution unitary. Naive techniques to control a unitary can substantially increase the required computational resources.

Here, we describe a compilation scheme that does not increase the number of arbitrary rotations for symmetric Trotterizations, which applies to second-order and higher Suzuki-Trotter decompositions. This halves the number of arbitrary rotations required to implement controlled, Trotterized time evolution compared to the standard approach. Arbitrary rotations contribute significantly to resource estimates in a fault-tolerant architecture due to the number of required magic states. Therefore, arbitrary rotations dominate the $T$-cost of fault-tolerant implementations of quantum simulation.

This challenge is particularly acute in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectra, where high-performance devices require materials that are simultaneously highly refractive and transparent. Here, we report on the van der Waals (vdW) crystal cadmium phosphorus trisulfide (CdPS3) as a solution to this long-standing problem. Through comprehensive optical and structural characterization, we show that CdPS3 possesses an anomalously high in-plane refractive index across the visible spectrum approaching 3 in the near-UV, combined with a wide indirect bandgap. This combination of properties, which circumvents the empirical Moss's law, is validated by first-principles calculations and direct near-field imaging of highly confined waveguide modes. These findings establish CdPS3 as a leading material for UV-visible photonics, opening a new pathway for the development of high-density integrated circuits and metasurfaces."}

Using four representative works from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries-Il Principe (Machiavelli), Il Cortegiano (Castiglione), I Ricordi (Guicciardini), and Orlando Furioso (Ariosto)-we construct character-based n-gram models under both a historically grounded 25-letter orthography and the full modern Italian alphabet. These models provide corpus-derived probabilistic baselines for evaluating substitution-cipher search processes. Combining classical hill climbing and simulated annealing with Grover-style quantum-inspired estimates and a QUBO annealing formulation, we quantify how the probability that a key produces a linguistically plausible decryption (pgood) relates to expected computational effort. Across cipher lengths from 200 to 1000 characters, empirical results confirm the predicted dependence of Grover oracle calls on 1/sqrt(pgood) and show that longer texts yield sharper score distributions and smaller feasible key regions. Overall, the findings establish a link between linguistic redundancy and search-space contraction, providing an empirical framework for comparing classical, quantum-inspired, and idealized quantum search dynamics under unified corpus-driven constraints."}

It reduces to the Schwarzschild metric when gamma = 1. In this paper we explore potential signatures of the gamma-metric on periodic orbits and their gravitational-wave radiation. Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy. We also compute representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits and demonstrate that gamma != 1 can induce phase shifts and amplitude modulations correlated with changes in the zoom-whirl structure. In particular, larger zoom numbers lead to increasingly complex substructures in the waveforms, and finite deviations from gamma=1 can significantly modify these features. Our results indicate that precise measurements of waveform morphology from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals may constrain deviations from spherical symmetry encoded in gamma."}

Exfoliated flakes are most commonly obtained through mechanical exfoliation, which generally produces vdW flakes with tens-of-micron lateral dimensions. As a result, conventional ellipsometry - which depends on large, uniform areas and specific spectral models - becomes challenging to apply. Our method determines the refractive index directly from the spectral position of reflectivity minima, provided the flake thickness and the substrate complex refractive index are known. We demonstrate the technique on hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), a vdW semiconductor with high refractive index and low absorption, retrieving its in-plane refractive index across the visible range. The results both validate previous ellipsometry measurements and establish this method as an accessible and spectral-model-free alternative for refractive index characterization of vdW materials."}

CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices."}

However, disorder presents a failure mechanism that can destroy topological in-gap states. Here, we investigate a disordered two-dimensional polariton lattice and employ the spectral localizer framework to define a real-space topological index rooted in crystalline spatial symmetries. This framework enables direct real-space mapping of topology beyond conventional momentum-space classifications, confirming the presence of corner and edge modes in this generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Furthermore, it can directly quantify topological protection of a state. We leverage the versatility of our platform to experimentally realize normally distributed, random disorder and find that the corner states persist until the spectral gap closes. Experimentally, this corresponds to a disorder strength of approximately one quarter of the spectral gap. The spectral localizer accurately identifies the disorder strength at which the bandgap closes, establishing the framework as a predictive tool for every finite size system.

A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors."}

The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering."}

Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk.

In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave\" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three."}

In all three scenarios of matter-gravity interactions, including mini-superspace, semiclassical gravity, and stochastic gravity approaches, our results agree with the GIE protocol and its implications. More precisely, we show that the mesoscopic quantum bodies with their parities of mass quadrupoles interacting via Newtonian gravity can get entangled only if the parity of the gravitational tidal field sourced by the quantum body is also quantized.

The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter.

We consider a setting in which the control qubit is the very system on which the measurements are performed, while the target qubit serves as a noisy quantum memory. Focusing on Pauli channels, we show that feeding them into the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip can significantly reduce the total entropic uncertainty as compared to their direct application.

By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon.

We employ the communication matrix formalism where the measurement statistics of a prepare-and-measure scenario is represented as a stochastic communication matrix. In order to differentiate between any two quantum channels, the informational completeness of the set-up is both necessary and sufficient. On the other hand, if we want to uniquely characterize any quantum channel, in addition we also need to have a complete description of the set-up. We show that in many important cases we can deduce this information directly from the communication matrix of the set-up before applying the channel. Given that we trust the dimension of the system, we show that we can deduce the information completeness of the set-up directly from the rank of the communication matrix. Furthermore, we show that another quantity of the communication matrix, called the information storability, can be used to self-test the set-up (up to unitary or antiunitary freedom) for an important class of states and measurements. This provides us a semi-device-independent way to identify quantum channels from the prepare-and-measure statistics.

To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level.

Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy.

In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms.

Solving such problems is computationally demanding because it requires repeatedly solving a PDE and using its solution within an optimization process. In this paper, we first propose a fully coherent quantum algorithm for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed method combines a quantum PDE solver that prepares the solution vector as a quantum state, and a quantum optimizer that assumes oracle access to a quantized objective function. The central idea is the explicit construction of the oracle in a form of block-encoding for the objective function, which coherently uses the output of a quantum PDE solver. This enables us to avoid classical access to the full solution that requires quantum state tomography canceling out the potential quantum speedups. We also derive the overall computational complexity of the proposed method with respect to parameters for optimization and PDE simulation, where quantum speedup is inherited from the underlying quantum PDE solver. We numerically demonstrate the validity of the proposed method by applications, including a parameter calibration problem in the Black-Scholes equation and a material parameter design problem in the wave equation.

It employs a classical optimizer to iteratively update the parameters of a variational quantum circuit in order to search for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The efficacy of VQEs largely depends on the optimizer employed. Recent studies suggest that Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG) can achieve faster convergence than vanilla gradient descent (VG), but at the cost of additional quantum resources to estimate Fubini-Study metric tensor in each optimization step. The Fubini-Study metric tensor used in QNG is related to the entire quantum state space and does not incorporate information about the target Hamiltonian. To take advantage of the structure of the Hamiltonian and address the limitation of additional computational cost in QNG, we propose Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (H-QNG). In H-QNG, we propose to use the Riemannian pullback metric induced from the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the Hamiltonian terms onto the parameter space. We show that H-QNG inherits the desirable features of both approaches: the low quantum computational cost of VG and the reparameterization-invariance of QNG. We also validate its performance through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians, showing that H-QNG achieves faster convergence to chemical accuracy while requiring fewer quantum computational resources."}

The resulting additional degrees of freedom enable a more diverse exploration of the network, which we exploit by employing a swarm of chiral quantum walks. Thus, we enhance the predictive power of quantum walks on complex networks. Indeed, compared to a non-chiral algorithm, the chiral version exhibits greater robustness, making its performance less dependent on the optimal evolution time--a critical hyperparameter of the non-chiral model. This improvement arises from complementary dynamics introduced by chirality within the swarm. By analyzing multiple phase-sampling strategies, we identify configurations that achieve a practical trade-off: retaining the high predictive accuracy of the non-chiral algorithm at its optimal time while gaining the robustness typical of chirality. Our findings highlight the versatility of chiral quantum walks and their potential to outperform both classical and non-chiral quantum methods in realistic scenarios, including comparisons between successive versions of evolving databases."}

We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\\mathbb{P}^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other. While this operation is trivial for the surface code, it induces a product of logical CNOT gates on the encoded information.

Specifically, we present an architecture employing a teleportation-based squeezing protocol and polynomial-gate applications integrated into a time-multiplexed multi-mode cluster state to generate cat states with high amplitudes, which are consequently used to generate GKP states with high quadrature effective squeezing. Compared to our previous work, in addition to using squeezing as a resource, the present architecture reduces damping and noise by minimizing the number of homodyne measurements required in GKP state generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements - including dynamic input-state resetting and an improved breeding algorithm - by achieving a fault-tolerance threshold of 11.5 dB cluster squeezing using the RHG surface code for error correction, without requiring active switching or photon-number resource states."}

These gates are constructed using a sequence of single-flux quantum (SFQ) pulses that are sent to the qubit through either capacitive or inductive coupling. The schedule of SFQ pulses is constructed with an on-ramp and an off-ramp applied prior to and after a pulse train, where the pulses are spaced at intervals equal to the qubit period. We reduce the optimization problem to the scheduling of a fixed number of SFQ pulses in the on-ramp and solve it by relaxing the discretization constraint of the SFQ clock as an intermediate step, allowing the use of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimizer. Using this approach, gate fidelities of 99.99 % can be achieved for inductive coupling and 99.9 % for capacitive coupling, with leakage being the main source of coherent errors for both approaches."}

Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions. This way one can define quantum thermocouples which convert an injected heat current into useful power in an isothermal conductor, or work as refrigerators.

Thus, the GIE protocol implies that classical gravity cannot produce or mediate quantum entanglement, to which a recent paper \\cite{Aziz:2025ypo} shows the opposite. In all three scenarios of matter-gravity interactions, including mini-superspace, semiclassical gravity, and stochastic gravity approaches, our results agree with the GIE protocol and its implications. More precisely, we show that the mesoscopic quantum bodies with their parities of mass quadrupoles interacting via Newtonian gravity can get entangled only if the parity of the gravitational tidal field sourced by the quantum body is also quantized. We also point out a possible loophole that could seemingly violate the GIE protocol due to the truncation of higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion by orders of the Newton constant."}

However, these approaches may overlook crucial quantum phenomena that operate at the nanoscale, particularly within the highly-compacted genetic material of the viral capsid. The confined, high-density environment of genetic material within the capsid strongly suggests that quantum confinement effects play a significant, yet unexplored, role in viral processes. This study introduces a novel quantum approach using Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SQM) to investigate the quantum confinement effects on viruses. In this paper, the viral capsid environment is modeled using the Pariacoto virus, a model system well-suited for this analysis due to its specific structural properties. The findings reveal that quantum effects are not merely marginal but essential for understanding key processes inside the capsid, providing new insights beyond the scope of classical physics."}

Ranging from moiré and super-moiré materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $α$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $α$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena."}

In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects."}

Silva"], "title": "Screw-dislocation-engineered quantum dot: geometry-tunable nonlinear optics, orbital qubit addressability, and torsion metrology", "comment": "10 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \\textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\\sim 6.8$ to $\\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\\sim 10^{5}~\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \\textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter."}

We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction."}

In this work, we introduce a controlled violation of this principle by inserting a parametric controlled-unitary gate that enables a tunable leakage of quantum information from the black hole interior to the exterior, while preserving global unitarity. By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon. These features mimic quantum-gravity-induced effects such as remnant formation and horizon permeability, suggesting that minimal deviations from classical causality can leave long-lived imprints on black hole information dynamics."}

The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $Ω/Λ$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision."}

Here, we report the observation of critical scaling in a two-dimensional quantum gas of essentially noninteracting photons, which thermalize by radiative contact to a reservoir of molecules inside a microcavity. By measuring the spatial correlations near the condensation transition, we determine the critical exponent for the correlation length to be $ν= 0.52(3)$.
