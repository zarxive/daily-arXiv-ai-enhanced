Conventional approaches demand large arrays of antennas or transducers to reconstruct the full reflection or transmission matrix, enabling advanced protocols such as selective focusing or adaptive wave control. Yet, these arrays are expensive, bulky, and difficult to implement at microwave frequencies. Here, we show that a single transmitting-receiving antenna, when combined with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), can fully reconstruct the reflection matrix from far-field measurements, effectively transforming the RIS into a programmable synthetic antenna array. This approach allows high-fidelity imaging of complex scenes, selective focusing through clutter, and real-time tracking of moving targets. Our results establish RIS as a versatile, low-cost platform for matrix-based imaging, with broad implications for adaptive wave control, real-time sensing, and imaging in environments previously considered inaccessible."}

This challenge is epitomized by the charge density wave material 1T-TiSe$_2$, where photoexcitation disrupts its presumed hybrid exciton-phonon order. This exposes a paradox: the electronic component collapses within femtoseconds while the periodic lattice distortion persists. If the lattice distortion outlives the excitonic condensate, were they truly intertwined? Here we resolve this by uncovering a low-frequency mode (approx. 0.13 THz) emerging only in the ordered state, signaling exciton-phonon coupling. This mode is consistent with a locked phason -- a collective excitation arising if coupling between the excitonic condensate and lattice reduces continuous phase symmetry to a discrete one, giving the excitonic Goldstone mode finite mass. This is captured by an effective theory describing a shared potential landscape. At a critical threshold, the collapse of excitonic order flattens the potential, triggering an exciton-phonon catastrophe: selective overheating of the charge density wave phonon, disappearance of the locked phason, and sudden loss of electronic coherence. Remarkably, the lattice distortion survives as a dynamically trapped, non-thermal remnant, confirmed by the anomalous temperature dependence of the phononic response. These findings demonstrate that coupled potential energy landscapes can be manipulated to selectively dismantle complex quantum orders, advancing material control through dynamical design."}

Monolithic ribbon-like, or multi-filar suspension geometries provide a key to such dilution in torsion, but are challenging to make. As a solution, we introduce a lithographically defined silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) ribbon suspension in a wafer-scale approach to pendulum fabrication that is conducive to such 2-D geometries, making extreme aspect ratios, and even multi-filar designs, a possibility. A monofilar, monolithic, centimeter scale torsion pendulum is fabricated and released in a first proof of concept. Mounted in vacuum, it is optically excited and cooled using measurement based feedback. Though only 37 mg, the device displays a fundamental frequency of 162 mHz and an undiluted Q of 12000, demonstrating a foundational step towards ultra-coherent, ultra-low frequency torsion pendulums."}

Microscopic imaging of nitrogen gas has been challenging due to extremely weak signals stemming from low order Raman interaction. Wide-field coherent Raman micro-spectroscopy has demonstrated the ability to chemically distinguish nitrogen gas although it has been difficult to quantify spatial-density information due to significant levels of background noise. By subtracting the Gaussian beam shape and removing contributions from uninformative noise simultaneously from the set of images, we can reconstruct the normalized intensity fluctuations. Our analysis demonstrates that nitrogen gas within microvolume can be rapidly monitored under ambient conditions in less than 0.2 seconds. We believe that our work has the potential to improve visualization of microscopic flows due to molecular dynamics of gases and/or liquids otherwise invisible to infrared optical techniques."}

Extending the Copeland-Liddle-Wands (CLW) scalar-fluid dynamical system to a six-dimensional phase space including shear, curvature, and spin-torsion, I recast the equations in a compact deceleration-parameter form, compute the full Jacobian, and evaluate maximal Lyapunov exponents. Numerical solutions show that the ekpyrotic branch ($w_φ\\gg1$) exponentially damps homogeneous shear, while the softened branch ($w_φ<1$) allows $ρ_s$ to overtake the scalar during contraction and trigger a torsion-supported bounce at high but finite densities where the EC spin-torsion term becomes dynamically dominant. Scans in a two-parameter softening plane $(φ_{\\rm b},Δ)$ identify a finite region of nonsingular trajectories and quantify the required tuning; in the parameter ranges explored the maximal Lyapunov exponent on the constrained phase space is negative, giving no indication of chaotic behavior in this homogeneous truncation even when the usual curvature mode that destabilizes contracting General Relativity (GR) backgrounds is included. The construction is purely phenomenological and confined to homogeneous backgrounds: it does not address entropy accumulation, the cosmological arrow of time, or a complete cyclic cosmology."}

The model characterizes non-reciprocal attacks through a unified metric, termed attack intensity. Based on the analysis of attack intensity, we accurately predict both instantaneous and accumulating attacks in a 100-km dual-comb two-way time-transfer system. Beyond security considerations, we find that the BAND model can explain intrinsic fiber noise and delay-unsuppressed noise naturally, offering an effective tool to establish an environment-sensitive link model.

Under these conditions, the abelian charge lattice is completely filled by single-particle states for $G=SO(N)$ with $N\\geq 5$ and $G=SU(N)$ with $N\\geq 3$, which in turn implies completeness for other symmetry groups such as $Spin(N)$, $Sp(N)$, and $E_8$.

In the low-lying regime, we characterize realistic circumstances in which there is a breakdown of the expected scale invariance so that the collective excitations follow hydrodynamic theory instead of the predictions given by SO(2,1) conformal symmetry. In the high energy regime, we focus on important trap effects associated with acoustic oscillations which have been of interest experimentally.

Its high sensitivity is enabled by high-precision localization of gamma-ray interactions within its active detector volume, and the subsequent tracking of gamma-ray scattering sequences. In order to perform gamma-ray tracking, we need to simulate signal generation in the detectors accurately. This requires both accurate calculations of charge movement in the semiconductor volume, as well as a faithful reproduction of real-world experimental effects such as the electronics response. This work addresses the fidelity of the calculated signals for GRETA in two ways. An updated approach has been applied to find an optimized parameterization of the electronics response, while the impact of the detector temperature was also explored to best reproduce experimental signals and improve the position localization performance for GRETA. The results suggest that the electronics response can be simplified without impacting performance, and that the response correction parameters can effectively compensate for the changes in signal which arise due to the crystal temperature, resulting in minimal sensitivity of the position resolution to the assumed temperature."}

The HCIs are produced in a compact electron beam ion trap, then charge selected, decelerated, and finally injected into a cryogenic linear Paul trap. There, they are captured into $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Coulomb crystals, and co-crystallized within them, causing dark voids in their fluorescence images. Fine control over the number of trapped ions and HCIs allows us to realize mixed-species crystals with arbitrary ordering patterns. By investigating Xe$^{q+}$--Ca$^+$ strings, we confirm the HCI charge states, measure their lifetime and characterize the mixed-species motional modes. Our system effectively combines the established quantum control toolbox for Ca$^+$ with the rich set of atomic properties of Xe highly charged ions, providing a resourceful platform for optical frequency metrology, searches for signatures of new physics, and quantum information science."}

In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and their corresponding gravitational wave emissions within the framework of an effective field theory-based extension of general relativity (EFTGR), which incorporates higher-order curvature terms into the Einstein-Hilbert action. We start with a brief analysis of the modified black hole spacetime in EFTGR and examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. Focusing on the impact of the higher-order curvature terms in EFTGR, we examine the properties of periodic orbits, which are characterized by three topological integers $(z, w, v)$ that uniquely classify their trajectories. By analyzing these orbits within EFTGR, we aim to provide new insights into how strong-field deviations from general relativity may manifest in observable phenomena. We then calculate the gravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying potential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection between the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the gravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures. The results contribute to a clearer understanding of the dynamical features of EFTGR and open new avenues for probing black hole properties via gravitational wave detection."}

Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena."}

In this work, we present a computational study of LWFA in a specially designed single-stage capillary gas-cell target aimed at producing high-quality, GeV-class electron beams. The capillary cell includes a short (~2 mm) injection region at the entrance filled with a helium (He) and nitrogen (N2 ) gas mixture. This is followed by a longer (~12 mm) pure He section, which provides the required acceleration length and limits continuous ionization injection, thereby significantly reducing the energy spread of the accelerated beam. Hydrodynamic simulations are performed to optimize the capillary geometry and generate the required two-section gas-pressure profile. The resulting gas-density distributions for various cases are then directly incorporated in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study LWFA. In particular, our hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate how tailored density profiles with longitudinal density tapering in the acceleration section can be realized in a capillary gas cell, while the corresponding PIC simulations reveal how these profiles influence the acceleration process and the resulting beam quality. Using a 100 TW-class laser system with parameters relevant to the L2-DUHA laser at the ELI Beamlines Facility, the PIC results demonstrate electron acceleration to mean energies exceeding 1.0 GeV with high-quality beam properties.

Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T \\to 0) = \\ln[2\\cos(π/(n+2))]$.

These will ensure cohesion between the nanocelluloses. To optimize the orientation of the nanocelluloses within the filaments, and thus potentially improve the mechanical properties of the fibres, we present a study on the development of a millifluidic method of flow-focusing. The developed setup uses external sheath flows to focus and align a nanocellulose suspension central flow. Different configurations in terms of concentrations, circuit designs and flow velocities are tested. 3D printed circuits are explored to produce versatile geometries and optimize the process design. To qualify the orientations during the process, observations with a polarized microscope (POM) are made, as the alignment of the nanocellulose crystalline structures creates birefringence in suspensions. Significant optical phase shifts related to the nanocellulose particles' orientations are visible by color gradients, varying with the suspensions' concentrations and flow velocities. Results demonstrate successful tuning of nanocellulose orientation into anisotropic hydrogels using different millifluidic circuit geometries, with the introduction of xyloglucans to produce new types of biosourced fibres."}

Understanding how redundant and synergistic interaction emerges from elementary connectivity patterns is important in characterizing the behavior of physical, biological, and engineering systems. In this study, the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) is employed to investigate how pairs of signals measured at the nodes of large network systems contribute individually and in cooperation with each other to determine the overall state of the network. The analyzed systems are networks of numerically simulated Roessler oscillators and physical single-transistor electronic chaotic oscillators, reproducing purely pairwise and symmetric links in biological neuronal cultures, and cortical electroencephalographic networks assessed in humans. In the two settings, PID was extensively applied to decompose the information brought by pairs of signals to the overall state of the system, assessed respectively as the dynamic regime (from asynchronous chaos to synchronization) and the subject condition (open vs. closed eyes). Our approach highlights the coexistence of redundant and synergistic interplay in determining the effect of the pairwise dynamics on the system's state. Specifically, we demonstrate how, in a highly synchronized system, where units act following overlapped redundant behaviors, their joint consideration helps determine the system's state though their synergistic interactions. Our findings reveal the emergence of non-trivial behaviors in networked system based on pairwise connections and straightforward neural states, highlighting the need for using appropriate analytical tools to capture complex phenomena."}

However, so far on-chip gas sensing based on traditional laser absorption spectroscopy has demonstrated low detection sensitivity, due to weak light-gas interaction over a limited interaction distance. On-chip photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) appears to be a powerful technique to achieve higher sensitivity, its performance is yet constrained to parts-per-million (ppm)-level due to small fraction of evanescent field in the light-gas interaction zone and fast thermal dissipation through the solid substrate. Herein, we demonstrated suspended chalcogenide glass waveguide (ChGW)-enhanced PTS that overcomes these limitations, enabling highly sensitive parts-per-billion (ppb)-level molecular gas sensing. We fabricated a nanoscale suspended ChGW with low loss of 2.6 dB/cm using CMOS-compatible two-step patterning process. By establishing an equivalent PTS model to guide the optimization of the ChGW geometry, we achieved a 4-fold increase in the absorption-induced heat source power and a 10.6-fold decrease in the equivalent heat conductivity, resulting in a 45-fold enhancement in photothermal phase modulation efficiency over the non-suspended waveguides. Combining with a high-contrast waveguide facet-formed Fabry-Perot interferometer, we achieved an unprecedented acetylene detection limit of 330 ppb, a large dynamic range close to 6 orders of magnitude, and a fast response of less than 1 s. The overall system exhibits a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient of 3.8x10-7 cm-1, setting a new benchmark for photonic waveguide gas sensors to the best of our knowledge.

Such RMPS models allow us to exactly define and compute contributions of higher topologies and replica geometries in the gravitationally prepared state to all orders. We show that the bra-ket wormhole phase transition, a crucial physical property of gravitationally prepared states, is ensured if the transfer matrix of the RMPS satisfies the spectral gapping property, which we define, and define a class of models called $\\mathrm{O}(k)$ models satisfying this property. A novel advantage of RMPS models is that they allow us to compute the effects of off-shell wormholes, i.e., wormhole topologies without semiclassical solutions.

While surface immobilization has been widely used to extend observation times, it could disrupt molecular dynamics and impede biological function. Moreover, the study of weak molecular interactions requires high local concentrations, often leading to problems with signal saturation in fluorescence-based approaches. Recent advancements in single-molecule trapping techniques have addressed some limitations, but achieving precise, controllable, long-term trapping in a molecularly crowded environment without external forces remains difficult. Here, we introduce a nanopore-gated sub-attoliter silicon nanocavity that enables precise, non-perturbative trapping of individual biomolecules for extended observation times, eliminating the need for external forces. Using nucleosomes as model systems, we demonstrate single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor relative distances. Our data also show that an applied electric field can modulate the conformational properties of macromolecules, emphasizing a key advantage of our device: it does not require an electric field to retain trapped molecules. We envision this nanocavity platform as a powerful tool for interrogating molecular dynamics in physiologically relevant environments, offering unperturbed access to weak and transient interactions that are central to biological regulation."}

We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary \"holographic\" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime."}

The mechanism for generating the flow is distinct from the case of the Kondo problem (codimension-three defects) in that the effective particle-hole asymmetry that leads to the log running is due to the spatial anisotropy generated by the defect. The mechanism for the log generation has a simple geometric explanation which shows that hole fluctuations are suppressed as the incoming momentum is taken to be along the direction of the defect. The RG flow time is shown to scale with the length of the defect. We also show that the dislon, the Goldstone mode localized to the defect, couples in a non-derivative fashion to the bulk fermions and becomes relevant above the dislons' Debye frequency which depends upon the defect tension."}

Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field.

Recently, the spintronic Poisson bolometer was proposed as a promising platform for uncooled infrared detection. The Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, establishing a new detection paradigm. In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source, with the mean count rate modulated by incident radiation. In this work, we integrate a broadband plasmonic absorber optimized for LWIR absorption onto a spintronic Poisson bolometer to enhance thermal coupling and temperature rise in the sensing layer. The plasmonic absorber achieves over 60\\% absorptance across the LWIR spectrum, matching the blackbody radiation peak at room temperature. The device exhibits a best noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) of 35 mK at a 50 Hz frame rate and multiple results close to or below 100 mK, demonstrating room-temperature performance among the most sensitive uncooled LWIR detectors reported to date. This work advances uncooled infrared detection toward cryogenic-level sensitivity through the innovation of integrating spintronic materials and plasmonic materials, opening pathways to high-sensitivity LWIR sensing and imaging applications such as remote sensing, high-speed imaging, cryogenic system diagnostics, and industrial monitoring."}

While steady-state resonances are assumed in the search of gravitational wave echos, realistic barriers are expected to possess intrinsically low reflectivity. In this work, we investigate this low-finesse limit via time-domain simulations and demonstrate that early-time echoes behave as transient scattered wave packets rather than cavity eigenstates. A central finding is the identification of spectral drift, where the central frequency progressively redshifts. This evolution occurs because high-frequency components dissipate significantly faster than the fundamental mode due to the filtering effect of the potential barrier. To distinguish transient interference from genuine resonance, we establish a physical criterion based on cavity lifetime, identifying a critical reflectivity threshold of approximately $0.37$. Since theoretical models typically operate deep within the overdamped regime below this limit, the resulting signals are spectrally non-stationary. We propose that detection strategies should shift towards dynamic time-frequency tracking to capture these drifting signatures."}

For a theory with symmetry $G_1\\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $η$-invariant associated with the $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries."}

Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators."}

This work serves two main goals. First, we critically examine the limitations of SRSWT, showing that in the absence of external or interaction tuning, the theory tends to overestimate magnon self-energy corrections, often predicting first-order magnetic transitions with multivalued magnetization and metastable solution branches (i.e., self-consistent but thermodynamically unstable states). Second, we demonstrate that topological transitions -- signaled by magnon gap closings at the Dirac points -- can be tuned to occur below the magnetic transition temperature and within the thermodynamically stable regime. In particular, we identify two practical tuning strategies: applying an external Zeeman field of appropriate sign depending on the anisotropy strength, and introducing a small antiferromagnetic NNN exchange coupling. These findings not only clarify the predictive scope and limitations of SRSWT but also provide experimentally relevant guidance for realizing thermally driven topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnetic insulators."}

Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing."}

These inelastic amplitudes are nevertheless constrained by positivity bounds indirectly, by considering scattering states which are arbitrary superpositions of definite species two-particle states. While these `superposition bounds' have been studied and utilised extensively in the past, earlier analyses typically consider cases insensitive to relative particle masses and IR branch cuts. Here we derive new families of bounds that take account and depend explicitly on mass differences between species making no assumption of weak-coupling. We emphasise unusual non-analyticities induced by the IR mass difference within the superposition amplitude and use fixed (backwards) angle dispersion relations to prove our bounds.

In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime."}

Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena."}

The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes.

Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved CGH in reconstructed quality and computational efficiency. However, deploying neural CGH pipelines directly on compact, eyeglass-style devices is hindered by stringent constraints on computation and energy consumption, while cloud offloading followed by transmission with natural image codecs often distorts phase information and requires high bandwidth to maintain reconstruction quality. Neural compression methods can reduce bandwidth but impose heavy neural decoders at the edge, increasing inference latency and hardware demand. In this work, we introduce JPEG-Inspired Cloud-Edge Holography, an efficient pipeline designed around a learnable transform codec that retains the block-structured and hardware-friendly nature of JPEG. Our system shifts all heavy neural processing to the cloud, while the edge device performs only lightweight decoding without any neural inference. To further improve throughput, we implement custom CUDA kernels for entropy coding on both cloud and edge. This design achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.15 dB at $<$ 2 bits per pixel with decode latency as low as 4.2 ms. Both numerical simulations and optical experiments confirm the high reconstruction quality of the holograms.

In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity."}

Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing."}

Stepanov"], "title": "Diagrammatics in the Dual Space, or There and Back Again", "comment": "Habilitation thesis", "summary": "Accurately describing many-body effects in multi-orbital systems remains a major challenge in theoretical condensed matter physics. At present, there is a significant methodological gap between the numerical tools used in ab initio computational materials science and those developed to study strong electronic correlations. The former can treat realistic, large-scale systems but typically neglect many-body effects, while the latter focus on simplified models with only a few degrees of freedom, as only such models can be solved accurately in the presence of strong interactions. The purpose of this thesis is to bridge these two approaches and establish a systematic theoretical framework for realistic correlated electronic materials. This involves a full-cycle methodology that begins with constructing ab initio interacting models from density-functional theory, solving them using dynamical mean-field theory to capture local correlations, and extending beyond to incorporate non-local collective electronic fluctuations. To this end, we introduce the \"dual\" approach to strong correlations, which includes the dual fermion, dual boson, and dual triply irreducible local expansion methods. The central idea of the dual theories is to shift the reference point of the conventional Feynman diagrammatic expansion from a non-interacting electronic system to an interacting but exactly solvable one. Integrating out this reference system recasts the expansion in an effective dual space, where all diagrammatic building blocks are renormalized by the corresponding impurity quantities. This procedure transforms a non-perturbative expansion in the original variables into a perturbative expansion in terms of dual fermionic and bosonic fields, exact in both the weak- and strong-coupling limits. In this thesis, we collect and systematize the major developments of dual techniques achieved to date."}

The prototypes employ 10 um pitch pixels with a fast operational amplifier-based buffering stage at the output, enabling direct characterization of intrinsic sensor response. Beam tests with minimum ionizing particles assessed the timing and charge collection of DC- and AC-coupled designs, including devices exposed to 10^14 NIEL and 10^15 NIEL non ioninsing energy loss. DC-coupled sensors demonstrated stable performance, maintaining time resolution lower than 70 ps and >99% detection efficiency up to 10^15 NIEL.\n  AC-coupled sensors demonstrated a wide operational margin, with efficiencies above 99% for clusterization thresholds below 150 electrons. Even though the AC coupling allows higher reverse bias than DC-coupled sensors, the reduced signal amplitude lowers the signal-to-noise ratio, increasing the jitter contribution. At high reverse bias, the AC-coupled sensors achieve time resolutions comparable to the DC-coupled version, demonstrating the viability of both approaches. These results also suggest that combining the low capacitance of DC-coupled designs with the high-bias capability of AC coupling could further enhance time resolution.\n  These results confirm the suitability of 65 nm MAPS for future collider detectors requiring high radiation tolerance, efficiency, and timing precision."}

Additionally, single-atom substitution of hydrogen by fluorine or other halogens along the alkane backbone significantly reduces thermal transport. Finally, our simulations of the length dependence of thermal conductance in alkane chains containing 3-12 carbon atoms reveal its saturation beyond eight carbon atoms.

This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge.

In this work, we highlight the direct connection between the low accuracy of AM1-BCC charges on polar species and the poor accuracy of corresponding hydration free energy calculations. We then propose an XGBoost regressor trained on atomic descriptors to rapidly predict charges obtained with high-fidelity density functional theory calculations at PBE0-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level. The more accurate electrostatic description results in more reliable free energy calculations than those obtained with semi-empirical AM1-BCC charges. Finally, we leverage this predictive model in combination with a 1 ns gas-phase molecular dynamics simulation to propose the Boltzmann Percentile method for assigning charges representative of the conformational ensemble of a molecule. Charges obtained with this method are robust to different input conformations, and the resulting free energies, calculated on a subset of the FreeSolv dataset, show a root mean squared error of 1.69 kcal/mol against the 3.05 kcal/mol obtained with semi-empirical charges as well as a significantly better ranking. Our method is easily integrable in the traditional workflow and requires the same computational resources. These two aspects make it a realistic tool for enhancing already expensive free energy calculations, and more in general, molecular dynamics simulations in condensed phase."}

Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics. Our findings also provide important insights for the development of quantum technologies that use entanglement in the time domain, including non-local temporal interferometry, temporal ghost imaging, and temporal state tomography in multi-particle systems."}

Recently, PECD was explored with polarization-tailored light such as bi-chromatic and non-collinear drivers, which still produces significant chiral signals. Yet, all known PECD configurations to date exhibit non-zero time-local chirality. That is, they are driven by an intrinsically helical light source. Nonetheless, 'chiral' light can also be non-helical if its chirality manifests on longer timescales (e.g. an optical centrifuge). It remains unknown whether PECD can arise from non-helical coherent light. Here we predict that PECD indeed emerges from non-helical light by employing a train of linearly-polarized intense laser pulses with a rotating polarization axis, which are phase-coherent and time-delayed. We find strong PECD in the model chiral molecule CBrClFH under a wide parameter regime that can be optimized up to ~8% by tuning delays between pulses, suggesting quantum interference. We directly show that the physical mechanism for this type of PECD differs from the standard case, relying on a chiral hole attosecond wave-packet evolving in the molecule, induced by the first linear pulse. Our work shows that multiple mechanisms can give rise to PECD on longer timescales and provides a novel approach for ultrafast chirality spectroscopy and coherent chiral wave-packet manipulation."}

For example, fully symmetry-adapted universal operator pools typically generate long and deep quantum circuits, gate-efficient universal operator pools generally break symmetries, and gate-efficient fully symmetry-adapted operator pools may not be universal. In this work, we analyze such symmetry dilemmas both theoretically and numerically. On the theory side, we prove that the popular, gate-efficient operator pool consisting of singlet spin-adapted singles and perfect-pairing doubles is not universal when spatial symmetry is enforced. To demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of pools, we perform numerical simulations using an adaptive algorithm paired with operator pools that are (i) fully symmetry-adapted and universal, (ii) fully symmetry-adapted and non-universal, and (iii) breaking a single symmetry and are universal. Our numerical simulations encompass three physically relevant scenarios in which the target state is (i) the global ground state, (ii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in multiple symmetry properties, and (iii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in a single symmetry property. Our results show when symmetry-breaking but universal pools can be used safely, when enforcing at least one distinguishing symmetry suffices, and when a particular symmetry must be rigorously preserved to avoid variational collapse.

In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source, with the mean count rate modulated by incident radiation.

Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious\" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory."}

We investigate bimerons on Möbius surfaces and show that the lack of global orientation alters conservation laws, yielding geometry-dependent topology and dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the helical twist and non-orientable geometry reshape the effective topological charge and stabilize chiral configurations imposed by the surface. Under spin-polarized currents, bimerons display unconventional transport: the transverse response is locally reversed or globally suppressed due to charge inversion along the manifold. Moreover, we establish an Aharonov-Bohm effect associated with the magnonic modes of the texture; in particular, the translational Goldstone mode implies that a bimeron on a Möbius strip should exhibit path-dependent quantum interference. These results identify a geometry-driven regime of magnetization dynamics and provide a route to curvature-engineered spintronic functionalities."}

Recently, PECD was explored with polarization-tailored light such as bi-chromatic and non-collinear drivers, which still produces significant chiral signals. Yet, all known PECD configurations to date exhibit non-zero time-local chirality. That is, they are driven by an intrinsically helical light source. Nonetheless, 'chiral' light can also be non-helical if its chirality manifests on longer timescales (e.g. an optical centrifuge). It remains unknown whether PECD can arise from non-helical coherent light. Here we predict that PECD indeed emerges from non-helical light by employing a train of linearly-polarized intense laser pulses with a rotating polarization axis, which are phase-coherent and time-delayed. We find strong PECD in the model chiral molecule CBrClFH under a wide parameter regime that can be optimized up to ~8% by tuning delays between pulses, suggesting quantum interference. We directly show that the physical mechanism for this type of PECD differs from the standard case, relying on a chiral hole attosecond wave-packet evolving in the molecule, induced by the first linear pulse. Our work shows that multiple mechanisms can give rise to PECD on longer timescales and provides a novel approach for ultrafast chirality spectroscopy and coherent chiral wave-packet manipulation."}

For example, fully symmetry-adapted universal operator pools typically generate long and deep quantum circuits, gate-efficient universal operator pools generally break symmetries, and gate-efficient fully symmetry-adapted operator pools may not be universal. In this work, we analyze such symmetry dilemmas both theoretically and numerically. On the theory side, we prove that the popular, gate-efficient operator pool consisting of singlet spin-adapted singles and perfect-pairing doubles is not universal when spatial symmetry is enforced. To demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of pools, we perform numerical simulations using an adaptive algorithm paired with operator pools that are (i) fully symmetry-adapted and universal, (ii) fully symmetry-adapted and non-universal, and (iii) breaking a single symmetry and are universal. Our numerical simulations encompass three physically relevant scenarios in which the target state is (i) the global ground state, (ii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in multiple symmetry properties, and (iii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in a single symmetry property. Our results show when symmetry-breaking but universal pools can be used safely, when enforcing at least one distinguishing symmetry suffices, and when a particular symmetry must be rigorously preserved to avoid variational collapse. Together, the formal and numerical analysis provides a practical guide for designing and benchmarking symmetry-adapted operator pools that balance universality, resource requirements, and robust state targeting in quantum simulations for chemistry."}

In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \\textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $ν=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \\textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $ν=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles.

I argue that the deeper conflict is logical: quantum theory is inherently contextual, whereas the classical tradition presupposes a single global, Boolean valuation. Building on Bohr's complementarity, the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen argument and Bell's theorem, I recast locality and completeness as the existence of a global section of a presheaf of value assignments over the category of measurement contexts. The absence of global sections expresses the impossibility of context-independent description, and Čech cohomology measures the resulting obstruction. The internal logic of the presheaf topos is intuitionistic, and the seven-valued contextual logic proposed by Ghose and Patra is exhibited as a finite Heyting algebra capturing patterns of truth, falsity and indeterminacy across incompatible contexts. Classical physics corresponds to the sheaf case, where compatible local data glue and Boolean logic is effectively restored. Measurement is therefore reinterpreted as sheafification of presheaf-valued truth rather than as a physical breakdown of unitarity. Finally, a $σ$--$λ$ dynamics motivated by stochastic mechanics provides a continuous interpolation between strongly contextual and approximately classical regimes, dissolving the usual measurement paradoxes and apparent nonlocality as artefacts of an illegitimate demand for global truth."}

Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum.

The underlying process is four-wave mixing between an optical signal and a multi-wavelength pump source via optical Kerr nonlinearity. To enhance the generally weak nonlinearity, high-quality (Q) microcavities are commonly used to achieve practical efficiency. However, the ultra-narrow linewidths of high Q cavities prohibit achieving massive throughput broadcasting due to Fourier reciprocity. Here, we overcome this challenge by harnessing a parity-time symmetric coupled-cavity system that supports equally spaced exceptional points in the frequency domain. This design seamlessly integrates generation of dissipative Kerr soliton comb source and all-optical signal broadcasting into a unified nonlinear process. As a result, we realize soliton-assisted intracavity massive signal broadcasting with a channel count exceeding 100 over 200 nm wavelength range, resulting in Terabit-per-second aggregated rates. This throughput surpasses the intrinsic microcavity linewidth constraint (~200 MHz) by over three orders of magnitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this approach through an optical convolutional accelerator, highlighting its potential to enable transformative capabilities in photonic computing. Our work establishes a new paradigm for chip-scale photonic processing devices based on non-Hermitian optical design."}

These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\\pm π/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral.

This work presents an implementation-level comparison of three representative encodings -- Angle, Amplitude, and a Hybrid phase/angle scheme -- for QCNNs under depolarizing noise. We develop a fully differentiable PyTorch--Qiskit pipeline with a custom autograd bridge, batched parameter-shift gradients, and shot scheduling, and use it to train QCNNs on downsampled binary variants of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST at $4\\times 4$ and $8\\times 8$ resolutions.\n  Our experiments reveal regime-dependent trade-offs. On aggressively downsampled $4\\times 4$ inputs, Angle encoding attains higher accuracy and remains comparatively robust as noise increases, while the Hybrid encoder trails and exhibits non-monotonic trends. At $8\\times 8$, the Hybrid scheme can overtake Angle under moderate noise, suggesting that mixed phase/angle encoders benefit from additional feature bandwidth. Amplitude-encoded QCNNs are sparsely represented in the downsampled grids but achieve strong performance in lightweight and full-resolution configurations, where training dynamics closely resemble classical convergence. Taken together, these results provide practical guidance for choosing QCNN encoders under joint constraints of resolution, noise strength, and simulation budget."}

In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions.

With a constellation of satellites and a set of ground stations in a satellite-based QKD system, how to schedule satellites to achieve efficient QKD is an important problem. This problem has been studied in the dual-downlink architecture, where each satellite distributes pairs of entanglements to two ground stations simultaneously. However, it has not been studied in the single downlink architecture, where satellites create keys with each individual ground station, and then serve as trusted nodes to create keys between pairs of ground stations. While the single downlink architecture provides weaker security in that the satellites need to be trusted, it has many advantages, including the potential of achieving significantly higher key rates, and generating keys between pairs of ground stations that are far away from each other and cannot be served using the dual-downlink architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic approach for satellite scheduling that accounts for fairness among the ground station pairs, while taking advantage of the dynamic satellite channels to maximize the system performance. We evaluate this approach in a wide range of settings and demonstrate that it provides the best tradeoffs in terms of total and minimum key rates across the ground station pairs.

By comparing the Penrose and Thue-Morse quasicrystals, we demonstrate that the nature of the magnetic phase transition is controlled by the electronic density of states (DOS): while the singular DOS of the Penrose tiling induces magnetic order at infinitesimal interaction strengths, the Thue-Morse lattice requires a finite critical interaction to drive the transition. Crucially, through a novel boundary construction strategy and rigorous finite-size scaling, we identify a quantum critical point on the Thue-Morse quasicrystal with critical exponents ($ν\\approx 0.94$, $β\\approx 0.72$ and $z\\approx 1.51$) that deviate significantly from the conventional $(2+1)$D Heisenberg $O(3)$ class.

Specifically, starting with the surface term, we extract a symmetric rank-two tensor together with an anti-symmetric one out of this term with the variation operator replaced with the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. By utilizing an equality stemming from the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density along an arbitrary vector field, it is proved that the resulting symmetric rank-two tensor is identified with the functional derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Such a result further brings forth the expression for the field equations constructed from the symmetric rank-two tensor, which naturally rules out the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric and coincides with the one for the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the construction of the expression for the field equations from the symmetric rank-two tensor must be feasible as long as the variation operator in the variation equation of the Lagrangian is allowed to be substituted by the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. On the other hand, as a byproduct, the anti-symmetric rank-two tensor turns out to be the Noether charge two-form. Our results offer a straightforward support on the proposal in our previous work that the surface term gives a unified description for field equations and Noether charges in the context of theories of gravity admitting diffeomorphism invariance symmetry."}

Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations.

We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary \"holographic\" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime."}

The first generalization consists in considering spaces with differential structures on them (the so-called ringed spaces) rather than the usual manifolds. This entails a generalization of the concept of smoothness, which allows us to think about a smooth passage through the singularity. The second generalization is related to the concept of curve.

In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space."}

Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators."}

Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}\\times{\\bf B})\\cdotσ$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $ΔR_{zz}(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E},{\\bf B})/R_0=-β_{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}\\times{\\bf B})^2$, with $β_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric.

We consider a sample of several wormhole solutions and plasma distributions for which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the light rays is separable. This allows us to derive analytical expressions for the shadow boundary and examine the behavior of the photon regions as the plasma frequency varies. We observe that plasma profiles which depend only on radial coordinate lead to common evolution of the photon region which does not depend on the wormhole metric and is consistent with the Kerr black hole. For plasma profiles with angular dependence the evolution of the photon region is specific for every spacetime thus wormholes are observationally distinguishable. We further investigate the formation of forbidden regions in the plasma medium where light cannot propagate. They lead to the formation of plasma frequency ranges where the shadow is no longer observable and we show that this phenomenon is characteristic for all the configurations in our sample. We obtain the critical frequencies for which the shadow vanishes and demonstrate that for all the wormholes they are lower than the critical frequencies for the Kerr black hole in the same environment. This implies that there exist plasma frequency ranges in which the Kerr black hole casts a shadow but wormholes do not, creating a strong observational signature for discriminating between compact objects. In the frequency ranges where both black hole and wormhole shadows exist the wormhole shadows are consistently smaller than those for the Kerr black hole. As the plasma frequency grows the discrepancy progresses showing that plasma medium facilitates the experimental detection of wormholes. Finally we consider aberrational effects on the wormhole shadows. They further increase the deviation from black holes making wormholes easier to detect."}

Despite its advantages, the underlying fragmentation mechanisms, their connection to the nanoparticle size distribution, and the energy efficiency of the process remain poorly understood. In this study for the first time, microparticle fragmentation is investigated in single-pulse, single-particle experiments on Au microparticles. Determining the absorbed peak fluence enables assessment of the process energetics. Pump-probe microscopy identifies photomechanical fracture of the molten microparticle volume and photothermal phase explosion of its superheated surface as the fragmentation mechanisms. We find that 83% of the absorbed laser energy is converted into cavitation bubble formation, while only 1% contributes to the surface energy of the generated nanoparticles. Despite this small fraction, MP-LFL outperforms laser ablation in liquids. The surface energy generated per absorbed energy is 10 times higher, and the overall energy efficiency is 14 times higher. This gain originates from the confined microparticle geometry, which minimizes energy losses and enhances photomechanical fragmentation via pressure focusing. These results position microparticle fragmentation in liquids as a fundamentally more energy-efficient approach for scalable, laser-based nanoparticle production than laser ablation in liquids."}

In a remarkable paper, motivated by the similarity between graph homology and the gauge theory BRST homology, Kreimer, Sars and van Suijlekom found such an expansion. The implication of this expansion is that the amplitudes in a generic non-abelian gauge theory can be constructed by transmuting the renormalised integrands of trivalent Feynman diagrams in a scalar quantum field theory. In this paper, we show that this surprising connection naturally emerges from Witten's open string field theory in the field theory limit."}

From a single causal requirement, namely causal consistency, together with sharp measurements, reversible symmetries, and no-signaling, we show that any admissible state-to-probability map must be affine under mixing; otherwise, its curvature enables superluminal signaling via steering. Using standard reconstruction results, affinity forces the probability assignment to coincide with the quadratic transition function of complex quantum theory. Our three-stage argument (operational assignment, causal-consistency constraints, and structural reconstruction) recovers complex quantum theory and identifies Born's rule as a causal fixed point among admissible probabilistic laws. We discuss limitations of the derivation and outline steering-based experiments that could bound deviations from affinity."}

For a theory with symmetry $G_1\\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $η$-invariant associated with the $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries."}

Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.\n  A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity."}

Using hexagonal arrays of silver nanoparticles embedded in dye-doped waveguides, we demonstrate lasing at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, including the K and M points. K-point lasing exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in relative intensity between degenerate K and K' modes, with no bias induced by pump geometry, even for geometries that explicitly break symmetry.

We further show that spatially separated K-point lasers synchronize in phase and amplitude, undergoing SSB in lockstep. A theoretical density matrix approach cast into stochastic differential equations reproduces the observed real- and Fourier-space intensity distributions and SSB behavior.

While frame-change maps and frame-invariant resource sums are theoretically understood, their impact on circuit-based quantum information processing has largely remained unexplored. We formulate QRF transformations as circuit compilation rules and, for systems with finite Abelian symmetry described by the regular representation, derive a gate-level dictionary that maps local operations in one frame to their images in another. This yields a group-theoretic classification of gates where symmetry-commuting operators remain local, up to frame-dependent phases, while generic gates are promoted to controlled entangling operations in which the original frame acts as a control register. The resulting frame-dependence entangling-gate count defines a relational circuit complexity where the cost of a computation depends on the internal reference frame of the observer. We instantiate the framework in a three-qubit model and show that the QRF unitary acts as a lossless converter between a purity-based local coherence and concurrence, preserving their invariant sum and giving a concrete realization of the relativity of entanglement. We implement the corresponding circuits on an IBM Quantum superconducting platform, using full state tomography to reconstruct the redistribution of resources between internal frames. The hardware data reproduce the predicted conversion of local coherence into entanglement, and the observed deviations from exact conservation quantify the effect of realistic device noise on relational quantum protocols."}

Motivated by these considerations, we propose a model in which the connection is treated as an independent bitensorial field, leading to a bitensorial generalization of the Einstein equations. The model reduces to General Relativity when the matter source is classical. We apply it in two regimes: the late-time universe and the Newtonian limit. In the cosmological case, the model naturally gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant.

Longitudinal epsilon near zero metamaterials (LENZ), characterized by a vanishing permittivity along the optical axis provide an exceptional platform for field enhancement while mitigating absorption losses and impedance mismatch. We experimentally show that a Si and ITO multilayer engineered for a LENZ resonance in the near-infrared enables broadband, high pump transmission while still harnessing ENZ enhanced nonlinearity to generate a strong third harmonic signal. This demonstrates that efficient nonlinear processes can be driven without the high-loss conditions typical of isotropic ENZ media and regardless of intrinsic absorption at the harmonic frequency. The resulting third harmonic efficiency is comparable to isotropic ENZ films but without the absorption-induced heating constraints of ENZ operation. The high pump transmission enables transparent LENZ (TLENZ) stacks to be integrated into optical cavities, where resonant field buildup could amplify the nonlinear response without compromising thermal management.

Current NN mitigation relies on seismometer arrays and Wiener filtering, while distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) offers a complementary, low-cost means of obtaining dense strain measurements. We investigate fusion sensor arrays composed of both displacement-measuring seismometers and strain-measuring DAS-type sensors. We extend the Wiener filter formalism to mixed sensor types and introduce analytic S-wave strain correlation coefficients. Using a hybrid differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation scheme, we validate our approach against established seismometer-only results and analyze the geometry, robustness, and performance of optimized fusion arrays. Fusion arrays enhance P/S-wave disentanglement and achieve NN cancellation levels comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of seismometer-only arrays, particularly for small sensor numbers. When sensors are constrained to the ET infrastructure, we find that six seismometers complemented by fourteen strainmeters inside the ET arms can match the performance of twenty seismometers in boreholes, achieving a residual at the 10% level, and thereby offering a cost-efficient pathway toward ET-scale NN mitigation."}

Fraunhofer-based analyses further show that angular deflection can arise from intrinsic phase curvature within homogeneous media. Here we introduce a coherence-based constitutive framework that systematizes these observations: refraction can occur inside a bulk medium when coherence itself provides the effective boundary.\n  Two near-frequency structured beams write and probe a shared phase field, revealing reproducible angular rotation and coherence-lensing whose direction and magnitude follow the spectral detuning.

In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored.

Using Israel's junction formalism, we demonstrate that this coordinate singularity corresponds to a thin shell characterized by exotic matter with well-defined surface energy density and isotropic pressure. The shell obeys the barotropic equation of state $p = -ρ/2$, confirming the presence of exotic matter that violates the standard energy condition, which is a requirement for maintaining wormhole geometries. As the universe expands, this thin shell becomes increasingly diluted, scaling as $1/a(t)$ with the cosmic scale factor."}

The system incorporates dispersion-neutral intensity-control for few-cycle pulses, a vacuum HHG module with sub-micrometer and sub-degree sample positioning, and an imaging assembly that stabilizes the focal spot position and enables spatial filtering of the emitted harmonics. A synchronized dual-spectrometer scheme provides simultaneous UV/VUV and EUV radiation detection, while absolute electric field calibration is achieved through gas-phase attosecond streaking. Together, these capabilities establish a versatile and quantitatively reliable platform for solid-state HHG spectroscopy. The methodology is broadly adaptable to various laser sources and material classes, and supports future efforts aimed at reconstructing valence-electron potentials, tracking strong-field dynamics, and mapping electronic structure with sub-cycle temporal resolution."}

In this paper, we present Quantum Neural Radiance Fields (Q-NeRF), the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for neural radiance field rendering. Q-NeRF integrates QIREN modules into the Nerfacto backbone, preserving its efficient sampling, pose refinement, and volumetric rendering strategies while replacing selected density and radiance prediction components with quantum-enhanced counterparts. We systematically evaluate three hybrid configurations on standard multi-view indoor datasets, comparing them to classical baselines using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. Results show that hybrid quantum-classical models achieve competitive reconstruction quality under limited computational resources, with quantum modules particularly effective in representing fine-scale, view-dependent appearance.

In this work, we introduce the Fidelity-based Quantum Autoencoder (FiD-QAE), a quantum architecture that employs fidelity estimation as the decision criterion for anomaly detection.

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schrödinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schrödinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior\", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schrödinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schrödinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schrödinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory.

We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix.

Under these conditions, the abelian charge lattice is completely filled by single-particle states for $G=SO(N)$ with $N\\geq 5$ and $G=SU(N)$ with $N\\geq 3$, which in turn implies completeness for other symmetry groups such as $Spin(N)$, $Sp(N)$, and $E_8$.

The system retains the current $j^μ$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^μ$ in such a general covariant form that $s^μ=au^μ+ bj^μ$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^μ=(s-bj^0)u^μ/u^0+ bj^μ$, where $s$ is the entropy density.

In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity."}

On the other hand, space-time wave packets are structured waves whose spatio-temporal spectra lie on tilted space-time planes, so their group velocity can be programmed, including superluminal values, even in a uniform medium. Here we develop a general theory of space-time refraction for such structured waves at a planar moving interface and show how a single boundary reshapes their velocity content. By identifying the invariants of a translating boundary, we obtain refraction laws for baseband, X-wave, and sideband packets that apply for arbitrary interface velocities and connect smoothly to static and purely temporal limits. These laws reveal regimes of \"space-time anomalous optical push broom,\" where a moving interface compresses a wide range of incident velocities into a narrow transmitted band, and \"velocity spectral optical fission,\" where an incident X-wave splits into two propagation-invariant branches with distinct velocities. The combined freedom to prepare waves with superluminal group velocity and to prescribe equally unconstrained interface speeds points toward reconfigurable time gating, optical buffering, velocity multiplexing, and controlled emission in moving media, and provides a route to photonic settings capable of emulating dynamical effects traditionally associated with gravitational or quantum processes."}

Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T \\to 0) = \\ln[2\\cos(π/(n+2))]$.

It is usually considered for the processing of quantum bits (qubits) and its efficient implementation is obtained with two elementary components: the Hadamard gate and the controlled--phase gate. In this paper, the quantum Fourier transform operating with continuous variables (cvQFT) is considered. Thus, the environment becomes the Hilbert space, where the natural definition of the cvQFT will be related to rotation operators, which in the $N$--mode are completely specified by unitary matrices of order $N$. Then the cvQFT is defined as the rotation operator whose rotation matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. For the implementation of rotation operators with primitive components (single--mode rotations and beam splitters), we follow the well known Murnaghan procedure, with appropriate modifications. Moreover, algorithms related to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are applied to reduce drastically the implementation complexity. The final part is concerned with the application of the cvQFT to general Gaussian states. In particular, we show that cvQFT has the simple effect of transforming the displacement vector by a one-dimensional DFT, the squeeze matrix by a two-dimensional DFT, and the rotation matrix by a Fourier-like similarity transform."}

Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious\" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory."}

The mechanism for generating the flow is distinct from the case of the Kondo problem (codimension-three defects) in that the effective particle-hole asymmetry that leads to the log running is due to the spatial anisotropy generated by the defect. The mechanism for the log generation has a simple geometric explanation which shows that hole fluctuations are suppressed as the incoming momentum is taken to be along the direction of the defect. The RG flow time is shown to scale with the length of the defect. We also show that the dislon, the Goldstone mode localized to the defect, couples in a non-derivative fashion to the bulk fermions and becomes relevant above the dislons' Debye frequency which depends upon the defect tension."}

Our construction of measures derives its inspiration from the applications of MUBs, and based on them, we define certain quantifiable measures, which are can be computed and gives estimates of how close the Approximate MUBs are to the MUBs. We use geometric interpretation, projective design features of MUBs and applications like Optimal State determination and Entropic Uncertainty of MUBs. We show generic relationship between these measures and show that it can be evaluated for APMUBs without known the exact construction details, thereby showing that definition of APMUB is sufficient completely characterise it.

Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing."}

In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space."}

In this work we employ multi-site XPS with a narrowband femtosecond x-ray probe to unravel different ultrafast dissociation processes of a polyatomic molecule, fluoromethane (CH$_{3}$F). We show that XPS can follow the cleavage of both the C-F and C-H bonds in real time, despite these channels lying close in binding energy. Additionally, we apply the partial charges model to describe these dynamics, and verify this extension with both advanced ab-initio calculations and experimental data. These results enable the application of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems of higher complexity, by correlating real-time information from multiple atomic sites and interpreting the measurements through a viable theoretical modelling."}

We introduce a condition of operational robustness as a criterion for when an observable can be attributed an actual value in a given Bohmian state. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition: under appropriate regularity conditions, an actual value can be consistently assigned if and only if the wave function satisfies a local eigencondition of the corresponding operator at the particle's configuration. For general states, we define a weak actual value as a derived theoretical construct to characterize the local average behavior of an observable along a trajectory. We prove that its ensemble average equals the standard quantum expectation value and derive its evolution equation. Furthermore, we establish that the weak actual value equals the real part of the quantum weak value when post-selecting on position. This work extends and formalizes earlier discussions on the definability of observables in Bohmian mechanics, develops a conceptual and mathematical framework for discussing the ontological status of observables, and establishes a theoretical correspondence with weak measurement experiments."}

Furthermore, manipulating multiphoton correlations typically requires complex interactions that challenge few-photon level implementation. Here, we introduce a quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem for light beams, describing how their coherence-polarization properties are influenced by reflection and refraction, as well as how these properties evolve upon subsequent propagation. Our work demonstrates that the quantum statistics of photonic systems can be controllably modified through the inherent polarization coupling arising from reflection and refraction at an interface, without relying on conventional light-matter interactions. Our approach reveals regimes where thermal light can exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics with fluctuations below the shot-noise level through post-selected measurements, and this statistical property can be tuned by the incident angle. Remarkably, this quantum statistical modification is governed by a scaling law linking beam collimation to far-field thermalization.

Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime."}

The feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON) provides an attractive alternative to variational methods with a fully quantum feedback rule, but it fails in the presence of spectral degeneracies, where the feedback signal collapses and the evolution cannot reach the ground state. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice.

The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems."}

Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.\n  A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity."}

They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales."}

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

Although a quantum-assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN) was proposed to learn fuzzy membership for each feature, it cannot model dependencies between features due to its single-qubit encoding. To address this, this paper proposes a dual-qubit hierarchical fuzzy neural network (DQ-HFNN), encoding feature pairs onto a pair of entangled qubits, which extends the single-feature fuzzy model to a joint fuzzy representation. By introducing quantum entanglement, the dual-qubit circuit can encode non-classical correlations, enabling the model to directly learn relationship patterns between feature pairs. Experiments on benchmarks show that DQ-HFNN demonstrates higher classification accuracy than QA-HFNN, as well as classical deep learning baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies after controlling for circuit depth and parameter counts show that the performance gain mainly stems from the relational modeling capability enabled by entanglement rather than enhanced expressivity. The proposed DQ-HFNN model exhibits high parameter efficiency and fast inference speed.

We evaluate the steady-state entropy production rate and quantum correlations by applying the quantum phase space formulation to calculate the entropy change. Our study reveals the essential contribution of coherent feedback in the thermal bath's input-noise operators, resulting in the system being driven far from thermal equilibrium. Our analysis shows that in the small-coupling limit, the entropy production rate is proportional to the quantum mutual information. We use for application the optomechanical system of Fabry-Pérot cavity, and show that the picks of the entropy production corresponding of the heating/cooling of movable mirror are improved. Therefore, we conclude that irreversibility and quantum correlations are not independent and must be analyzed jointly. The results demonstrate the possibility of enhancement of entropy production and pave the way for promising quantum thermal applications through coherent feedback loop."}

Quantum nonlocality sharing provides a crucial strategy for the resource-efficient recycling of quantum correlations, offering a promising pathway toward scaling quantum networks. Despite its potential, the limited availability of resources introduces a fundamental trade-off between the number of sharable network branches and the achievable sequential sharing rounds. The relationship between available entanglement and the sharing capacity remains largely unexplored, which constrains the efficient design and scalability of quantum networks. Here, we establish the entanglement threshold required to support unbounded sharing across an entire network by introducing a protocol based on probabilistic projective measurements. When resources fall below this threshold, we derive an achievable trade-off between the number of sharable branches and sharing rounds. To assess practical feasibility, we compare the detectability of our protocol with weak-measurement schemes and extend the sharing protocol to realistic noise models, providing a robust framework for nonlocality recycling in quantum networks."}

Information enters as a resource when considering feedback-controlled thermal machines. While both a general theory of quantum feedback control as well as specific examples of quantum feedback-controlled engines have been presented, still lacking is a general framework for such machines. Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better."}

However, in the context of controlling ``chaotic'' quantum unitary dynamics, the situation is far more tenuous. The classical concepts of exponential sensitivity to trajectory initial conditions and ergodicity do not directly translate into quantum unitary evolution. Nevertheless properties inherent to quantum chaos can take on those roles: i) the dynamical sensitivity to weak perturbations, measured by the fidelity decay, serves a similar purpose as the classical sensitivity to initial conditions; and ii) paired with the fact that quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to be statistically described by random matrix theory, implies a method to translate the ergodic feature into the control of quantum dynamics. With those two properties, it can be argued that quantum chaotic dynamical systems, in principle, allow for full controllability beyond a characteristic time that scales only logarithmically with system size and $\\hbar^{-1}$. In the spirit of classical targeting, it implies that it is possible to fine tune the immense quantum interference with weak perturbations and steer the system from any initial state into any desired target state, subject to constraints imposed by conserved quantities. In contrast, integrable dynamics possess neither ergodicity nor exponential instability, and thus the weak perturbations apparently must break the integrability for control purposes. The main ideas are illustrated with the quantum kicked rotor. The production of revivals, cat-like entangled states, and the transition from any random state to any other random state is possible as demonstrated."}

In numerical experiments we study examples where we observe for a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions that the RGD steps needed to prepare a ground state scales linearly with the number of spins. For all-to-all couplings a quadratic scaling is obtained. To achieve efficient implementations while keeping convergence guarantees, we develop RGD approximations by randomly projecting the Riemannian gradient into polynomial-sized subspaces. We find that the speed of convergence of the randomly projected RGD critically depends on the size of the subspace the gradient is projected into. Finally, we develop efficient quantum device implementations based on Trotterization and a quantum stochastic drift-inspired protocol.

Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics. Our findings also provide important insights for the development of quantum technologies that use entanglement in the time domain, including non-local temporal interferometry, temporal ghost imaging, and temporal state tomography in multi-particle systems."}

First, we propose a physical mechanism based on decoherence-free subspaces. Second, we show that an exponential enhancement of the decay rate toward equilibrium, scaling with system size, can be obtained, leading to an extreme version of the phenomenon in Markovian open quantum systems. Third, we study the strong Mpemba effect through the unravelings of Davies maps, revealing subtleties in the choice of figures of merit used to identify the QME.

For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically rely on sampling procedures, leading to prohibitively large computational overheads and hindering their practical implementation on classical computers. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based dequantization framework for GSEE that eliminates the sampling process while preserving the asymptotic complexity of prior dequantized algorithms. In our formulation, the overhead arising from sampling is replaced by the growth of the bond dimension required to represent Chebyshev vectors as tensor network states. Consequently, physical structure, such as entanglement and locality, is naturally reflected in the computational cost. By combining this approach with tensor network approximations, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), we construct a practical dequantization algorithm that is executable within realistic computational resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can efficiently construct high-degree polynomials up to $d=10^4$ for Hamiltonians with up to $100$ qubits, explicitly revealing the crossover between classically tractable and quantum advantaged regimes. These results indicate that tensor network-based dequantization provides a crucial tool toward the rigorous, quantitative verification of quantum advantage in realistic many-body systems."}

We consider a bosonic model with two phase-shift parameters and analyze the performance of second- and third-order nonlinear scrambling using two classes of probe states: squeezed vacuum states and coherent states. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear scrambling mitigates sloppiness, increases compatibility, and improves overall estimation precision. We find third-order nonlinearity to be more effective than second-order under both fixed-probe and fixed-energy constraints. Furthermore, by comparing joint estimation to a stepwise estimation strategy, we show that a threshold for nonlinear coupling exists.

We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles."}

The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $ε= (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $ε$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments."}

Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena."}

In particular, we find that both the quantum-dot size and asymmetry allow electrical tuning of the g-tensor and significantly suppress magnitude and angular variability of the spin response for selected magnetic field directions. We confirm this behavior by analyzing single-disorder realizations and statistical ensembles in state-of-the-art strained and unstrained germanium channels, showing that the latter provides an optimal path for $g$-tensor engineering.

Within a model of a CI coupled to leads with a cylindrical geometry, we show that this is not true. In the proximity of the CI, the edge current leaks into the leads, with the Hall conductance quantized only if this novel proximity effect is taken into account.

The sampled basis is then symmetry-filtered by using various symmetries of the Hamiltonian which is then classically diagonalized in the reduced Hilbert space. We benchmark this approach on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain up to 24 qubits using the IBM Heron processor.

In this work we employ multi-site XPS with a narrowband femtosecond x-ray probe to unravel different ultrafast dissociation processes of a polyatomic molecule, fluoromethane (CH$_{3}$F).

This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}\\times{\\bf B})\\cdotσ$.

A direct description of such a phenomenon clearly requires going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $Λ$-doubling energy splitting (or $Λ$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively. The key observation is that, by parameterizing the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of both nuclear position ($\\mathbf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\\mathbf{P}$), a phase space method yields potential energy surfaces that explicitly include the electron-rotation coupling and correctly conserve angular momentum (which we show is essential to capture $Λ-$doubling).

Here we address this uncertainty by executing the iterative qubit coupled-cluster (iQCC) algorithm, designed for fault-tolerant quantum hardware, at unprecedented scale using a quantum solver on classical processors, enabling simulations of transition organo-metallic complexes requiring hundreds of logical qubits and millions of entangling gates. Using this approach, we compute the lowest triplet excited state (T$_1$) energies of Ir(III) and Pt(II) phosphorescent organometallic compounds and show that iQCC achieves the lowest mean absolute error (0.05 eV) and highest R$^2$ (0.94) relative to experiment, outperforming leading classical methods.
