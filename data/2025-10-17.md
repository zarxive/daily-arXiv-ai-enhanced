Abstract: This study investigates the suitability of Hydrogenated NanoDiamond (HND)
materials as an alternative for CsI in MPGD-based photon detectors. The
research focuses on characterizing HND photocathodes coupled with THGEM +
Micromegas-based detectors. The HND grains were prepared via hydrogenation and
stored in water for more than two years. They were then coated on PCB discs or
THGEMs using a pulsed spray technique. The resulting quantum efficiency (QE)
values (~4% at 122 nm) were found to be within a factor of 10 of the best
freshly hydrogenated samples reported in the literature ( ~40% at 120 nm). The
robustness of reflective HND photocathodes against ion bombardment was measured
to be about 10 times larger than the corresponding CsI one after the same
charge accumulation. Furthermore, THGEM characterization indicates minimal
alteration in response after HND coatings. These results suggest that HND holds
potential as a more robust photocathode for gaseous detectors, offering
improved performance in single-photon detection applications.

*Davinder Siwal,P. K. Mohanty,D. Bose,A. Jain*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 研究分析了LYSO晶体与塑料闪烁探测器棒在Geant4框架下的重叠消除时间(CRT)，结果显示LYSO的CRT值为174 ps，与文献报道值一致。通过模拟，塑料闪烁探测器棒的等效长度为LYSO的4倍，CRT值约为300 ps。若采用塑料棒构建小动物PET扫描器，可望实现约4.5 cm的最小图像分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁探测器在PET成像和医学成像中具有关键作用，理解CRT对于优化探测器性能和提高成像质量至关重要。

Method: 利用Geant4对LYSO晶体和塑料闪烁探测器棒在单片光栅德 Mosaiic探测器上的相互作用进行了模拟，分析了不同棒长度对CRT的影响。

Result: LYSO的CRT值为174 ps，与文献一致；塑料棒的等效长度为LYSO的4倍，CRT值约为300 ps。

Conclusion: LYSO在该条件下表现出优异的性能，塑料闪烁探测器棒在小动物PET中的应用可能带来约4.5 cm的图像分辨率。

Abstract: A systematic study is conducted to understand the coincident resolving time
(CRT) for a pair of Lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) and the plastic
scintillation detector bars under the Geant4 framework. Crystals are coupled to
a silicon photomultiplier single pad wafer with an appropriate optical coupling
for signal readout. Pad reads the light photons undergoing optoelectronic
conversion at the wafer site and generates electrical pulses with a
bi-exponential shape. These signals are used to determine the trigger time
stamp of back-to-back gamma-rays emitted from a point source, enabling the
evaluation of CRT performance at different plastic scintillator lengths. For
the LYSO detector, the simulation yields the CRT response of 174 ps, which
aligns to the literature reported value for the dimensions 2 mm x 2 mm x 10 mm.
To identify the plastic scintillator dimensions with an integrated gamma-ray
detection efficiency comparable to LYSO's photopeak efficiency at 511 keV gamma
photons, various bar lengths of commercial plastic BC404 and TIFR Ooty's
in-house developed plastic material are attempted in Geant4. Consequently, for
both the plastic scintillators, the equivalent length (for the same
cross-sectional area) was found to be 4 times that of LYSO crystal length at a
threshold of 25 keV. CRT value determined for this dimension is found to be
$\approx$ 300 ps for both the plastic medium. It suggests that, if an animal
preclinical PET scanner is developed with plastic bars, the minimum achievable
image resolution (FWHM) of $\approx$ 4.5 cm can be expected for a pair of
detection elements.

Abstract: We present the design and simulation of a 30 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick 4H-SiC
Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) optimized for high-voltage operation. A 2.4
$\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick epitaxially grown gain layer enables controlled internal
amplification up to 1 kV reverse bias, while maintaining full depletion below
500 V. Electrical characteristics, including I-V, C-V, and gain behavior, were
simulated in Synopsys Sentaurus Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) using a
quasi-1D geometry and verified across process-related variations in gain layer
parameters. To ensure high-voltage stability and proper edge termination, a
guard structure combining deep etched trenches and deep $p^+$ junction
termination extension (JTE) implants was designed. TCAD simulations varying the
guard structure dimensions yielded an optimized design with a breakdown voltage
above 2.4 kV. A corresponding wafer run is currently processed at IMB-CNM,
Barcelona.

Abstract: Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising
alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering
broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling.
Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the
design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by
providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on
silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical
model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical
properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant,
noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both
bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing
how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and
response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this
study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and
optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not
only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical
tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the
fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource
for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use
cases.

Abstract: We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically
accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in
computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely
limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this
bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep.
  Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable
sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary
variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel
transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain,
revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive
acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables
admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient
exact Gibbs sampling update.
  We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately
reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$
algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock
time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a
long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work
provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens
avenues for physics-inspired generative models.

### [6] [Yamaji effect in models of underdoped cuprates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13943)
*Jing-Yu Zhao,Shubhayu Chatterjee,Subir Sachdev,Ya-Hui Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses the angle-dependent magnetoresistance in underdoped cuprates, focusing on the pseudogap regime and the Yamaji effect. The authors propose distinguishing between spin density wave (SDW) and fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) theories using magnetoresistance measurements. They argue that the FL* model explains the experimental observations better than the SDW theory, particularly in the presence of a second Yamaji peak in samples like HgBa₂CuO₄+δ and potentially in anisotropic materials such as LSCO at higher magnetic fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the Fermi surface topology in high-temperature superconductors is crucial, and angle-dependent magnetoresistance is a key experimental tool to probe it. Different theories make distinct predictions, making it essential to distinguish between them experimentally.

Method: The authors use the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism and the ancilla layer model (ALM) to calculate the c-axis magnetoresistance for both SDW and FL* states. They compare theoretical predictions with experimental results from HgBa₂CuO₄+δ and discuss implications for anisotropic materials.

Result: The experimental data, particularly the absence of the second Yamaji peak in HgBa₂CuO₄+δ under intermediate magnetic fields, supports the FL* model over the SDW model. Additionally, the possibility of observing the Yamaji effect in anisotropic cuprates like LSCO at higher fields is suggested.

Conclusion: The study provides strong evidence in favor of the fractionalized Fermi liquid interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap regime. The results further establish the Yamaji angle measurements as a critical diagnostic for distinguishing between competing theoretical models of high-temperature superconductivity. This work underscores the importance of angle-resolved magnetoresistance in probing the Fermi surface properties of cuprates.

Abstract: Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates
have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap
regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
(Chan et al., Nature Physics 10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key
distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as
fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin
density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where
$p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance
$\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both
states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band
Hamiltonian. While the SDW Yamaji azimuthal angle $\theta$ is marginally
smaller than the FL* Yamaji $\theta$, the most significant difference is the
presence of a second Yamaji peak in the SDW theory near in-plane angle $\phi =
45^\circ$; there is no such second peak in the observations in
HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. Furthermore, we examine the role of anisotropic
interlayer hopping present in LSCO, and predict the potential emergence of the
Yamaji effect in LSCO at higher magnetic fields. Our results support the FL*
interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle
measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.

Abstract: We investigate the Sn-substitution effect on the thermoelectric transport
properties of the layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$] single
crystals, which exhibit a non-monotonic temperature variation of the electrical
resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient owing to the complex electronic and
magnetic states. We find that the onset temperature of the short-range
spin-density-wave (SDW) formation increases with the substituted Sn content,
indicating the impurity-induced stabilization of the SDW order, reminiscent of
the disorder/impurity-induced spin order in the cuprate superconductors. The
Seebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly
enhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier
concentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering.
We discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies,
and suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to
increase the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW
picture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.

TL;DR: 该论文通过实验和理论分析研究了Ba3MnTa2O9三重位点氧化物的磁性行为。实验结果表明，材料中Mn²+离子形成二维三角网络，尽管存在反铁磁相关性，但未呈现长期磁性秩序，这表明存在几何 frustration。理论计算进一步支持了这一结论。

Motivation: 研究新型氧化物材料的磁性行为，特别是通过二维三角网络结构实现的几何 frustration现象，具有重要的理论和应用意义。

Method: 该研究通过dc和ac磁化率、比热、ESR和密度泛函理论（DFT）等实验手段，并结合原子 spins 动态（ASD）模拟进行了磁性行为的研究。

Result: 实验结果表明，在Ba3MnTa2O9中，尽管Mn²+离子之间存在反铁磁相关性，但材料并未呈现长期磁性秩序，而是表现出二维三角网络结构导致的几何 frustration。此外，比热和熵释放结果也支持了这一结论。

Conclusion: 该材料通过二维三角网络结构实现了几何 frustration，产生了与预期理论值不一致的磁性行为。研究结果为理解二维磁性网络中的几何 frustration现象提供了新的证据，并有助于开发基于这种结构的新功能磁性材料。

Abstract: A triple perovskite oxide Ba$_{3}$MnTa$_{2}$O$_{9}$ has been synthesized and
its magnetic properties have been investigated through dc and ac magnetization,
specific heat, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements, and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mn$^{2+}$ ($S$ = 5/2) ions are the only
magnetic species present in the material. These Mn$^{2+}$ ions constitute a
quasi-two-dimensional triangular network in the crystallographic $ab$-plane.
Magnetization and specific heat measurements reveal the absence of any
long-range magnetic order down to 0.5\,K despite the presence of
antiferromagnetic correlations between the magnetic ions, suggesting the
presence of geometric frustration in the material. The entropy release is lower
than the expected theoretical value of $Rln(6)$, further suggesting the
presence of frustration. First-principles calculations using density functional
theory (DFT) and atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations further support this
lack of static magnetic order even at low temperatures and identify the
competing magnetic interactions along with the quasi-2D magnetic dimensionality
as the underlying origin of such an unconventional magnetic behavior.

Result: 在三联极限下，三联体具有四重简并基态，由自旋和转子自由度表征。通过第一阶 Perturbation 构建有效模型，提出基覆盖猜测。但该状态在低能范围内有效性尚待验证。

Conclusion: 研究展现了三联 Kagome 网络中可能存在新的量子磁场状态，但对其进一步验证仍需实验或更深入理论分析。

Abstract: We study the $S=1/2$ square-kagome lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with
the trimarized modulation. In the trimerized limit, each trimer hosts the
four-fold degenearte ground states characterized by the spin and chirality
degrees of freedom. We find that, within the first-order perturbation theory
with respect to the inter-trimer coupling, the effective Hamiltonian is the
Kugel-Khomskii-type model on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Based on a
mean-field decoupling, we propose a dimer-covering ansatz for the effective
Hamiltonian; however, the validity of these states in the low-energy sector
remains an open question.

Result: 在0.3 K下，观察到了在10.1 T时出现了一个约为38 K的能隙，这发生在40 K的温度下，这表明存在一种spin-Peierls式失稳。此外，在215 K的温度下发生了结构相变，使得超精细耦合常数急剧下降，进一步确认了一维特性的存在。

Conclusion: NaO₂证明了基于π轨道的一维自旋链材料，并且具备spin-gapped的基态，这是稀有的例举。这样的系统对于研究和开发量子体系具有重要意义。

Abstract: We report $^{23}$Na-NMR study on a candidate one-dimensional quantum spin
system NaO$_2$. The Knight shift, linewidth, and spin-lattice relaxation rate
$1/T_1$ were investigated down to 0.3 K under fields up to 16 T. The results
reveal the opening of a spin gap of $\Delta(10.1 {\rm T}) \simeq$ 38 K below
$T_{\rm S3} =$ 40 K, consistent with a spin-Peierls-like instability. The
hyperfine coupling constant was found to drop sharply across the structural
phase transition at $T_{\rm S2} =$ 215 K, highlighting the pronounced
one-dimensional character of the system. These findings establish NaO$_2$ as a

Abstract: Recent experiment on Fe-doped CoSn has uncovered a series of correlated
phases upon hole doping of the kagome flat bands. Among the phases observed, a
nematic phase with a six- to two-fold rotation symmetry breaking is found to
prevail over a wide doping and temperature range. Motivated by these
observations, we investigate the interaction-driven phases realized in a kagome
model with partially filled, weakly dispersing flat bands. Density-density
interactions up to second-nearest neighbors are considered. We identify a close
competition between ferromagnetic and nematic phases in our self-consistent
Hartree-Fock calculations: while on-site interaction favors ferromagnetism, the
sizable inter-sublattice interactions stabilize nematicity over a wide doping
window. Competition from translational-symmetry-breaking phases is also
considered. Overall, our results show that nematicity is a generic outcome of
partially filled kagome flat bands and establish a minimal framework for
understanding correlated flat-band phases.

*Hongyu Lu,Wang Yao*

TL;DR: This paper extends the understanding of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) beyond traditional Chern bands, demonstrating their emergence in non-Chern flat bands with various fillings and interaction strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore the conditions under which many-body topological orders, such as FCIs, can form in systems that deviate from the conventional Chern band paradigm.

Method: The authors employ numerical methods, including exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, to study FCIs in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices.

Result: Key findings include observing the Laughlin state at half-filling and a Moore-Read (non-Abelian FCI) in a singular flat band with onsite interactions. Additionally, the Laughlin FCI is observed in a gapped trivial band under certain parameters.

Conclusion: This research significantly broadens the understanding of FCIs by demonstrating their formation in non-Chern and non-Abelian flat band systems under various conditions.

Abstract: The rapid advances in the study of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) raise a
fundamental question: while initially discovered in flat Chern bands motivated
by their topological equivalence to Landau levels, is single- particle band
topology actually a prerequisite for these many-body topological orders
emergent at fractional fillings? Here, we numerically demonstrate bosonic FCIs
in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices, using exact
diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In a
gapless flat band with a singular band touching, we observe a Laughlin state at
half filling, stabilized by onsite interactions from the hard-core limit down
to arbitrarily small strength. Furthermore, we report the first example of a
non- Abelian FCI in a non-Chern band system: a Moore-Read state at $\nu$ = 1
filling of the same singular flat band with hard-core bosons. Under lattice
parameters that realize a gapped trivial band (C = 0) of exact flatness, we
also find the Laughlin FCI of soft-core bosons in the isolated band limit where
onsite interaction is much smaller than the band gap. In this case, the FCI
forms as interacting bosons spontaneously avoid the peaks in quantum metric and
Berry curvature, preferentially occupying Brillouin zone region with relatively
uniform quantum geometry. Our work significantly expands the landscape for
(non-)Abelian FCIs and broadens the understanding of their formation beyond the
Chern band paradigm.

Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of the physical properties and
Fermi-surface topology of layered single-crystal \ce{SrCu4As2} using electrical
transport, magnetotransport, and quantum-oscillation experiments plus

large, linear, and nonsaturating magnetoresistance is observed at low
temperatures in \ce{SrCu4As2}, likely attributable to the multipocket Fermi
surface. Quantum-oscillation data measured in magnetic fields of up to 60 T
show several oscillation frequencies exhibiting low effective masses,
indicating the presence of Dirac-like band dispersion in \ce{SrCu4As2}, as
suggested by the band structure calculations.

Motivation: 研究量子纠缠在量子磁体中的应用及其在实验中的探测方式具有重要的理论和实验意义。

Method: 本文使用了多方向环路更新量子蒙特卡罗（QMC）和精确对角化（ED）方法来计算量子费米信息（QFI），从而揭示不同相的特性及其相变特征。

Result: QFI随温度和波矢显示出不同相的特征能量尺度，并通过与实验数据的对比，能够有效区分不同的相和相变。

Conclusion: 量子费米信息（QFI）不仅能够检测量子纠缠，还能作为热动力学和动力学行为的敏感探针，在研究量子磁体中具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a novel measure of multipartite quantum
entanglement that can be measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments
on quantum magnets. In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to
understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing
on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional
quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent
photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which
is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show
that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal
characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the
global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the
ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as
two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI
shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the
classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss
our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing
experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results
demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also
be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of
quantum magnets.

TL;DR: 研究通过通用N体重整化群框架使用莫特绝缘体作为范例，提出了一种基于动态的量子相态分类，主要观察了莫特物质的内在动力学特征，包括通过长距离标量势对2体束缚状态的表征，以及莫特绝缘体和金属之间的动态区分。本文的贡献在于提供了对这一类莫特绝缘体的动态分类标准，并将其扩展至玻色子莫特系统。

Motivation: 当前量子相态分类方法主要依赖于对称性破坏，随着材料科学的快速发展，寻找基于动态特征的新分类标准具有重要意义。

Method: 研究采用通用N体重整化群框架，以莫特绝缘体为例，分析了莫特性的影响因素，提出了基于2体束缚态动力学的分类方法。通过计算长距离标量势和长距离排斥势，评估了粒子和空穴的束缚状态。

Result: 研究表明，莫特相和非莫特相可基于2体束缚态的动态特性精确区分。莫特相对应各动量的有效排斥势无明显空间尺度衰减，且单一占位数形成。此方法对拓扑莫特体和玻色子莫特体具有通用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子相态动力学分类提供了一个新的框架。研究结果表明，基于2体束缚态和动态特征的莫特态分类方法具有普适性，能够准确区分莫特相类和莫特金属类。

Abstract: Using Mott insulators as a prototypical example, we demonstrate a
dynamics-based characterization of quantum phases of matter through a general
N-body renormalization group framework. The essential "Mott-ness" turns out to
be characterized by a change of size-scaling of the effective intra- momentum
repulsions between long-lived emergent "eigen-particles" that encodes the
dynamics of two-body bound states in the high-energy sector. This directly
offers a universal characterization at long space-time scale for the
corresponding class of Mott insulators through a uniform single occupation of
all momenta, and otherwise Mott metals. This universal description naturally
paves the way to topological Mott insulators and is straightforward to extend
to bosonic Mott systems. More generally, this demonstration exemplifies a
generic paradigm of characterizing quantum phases of matter through their
distinct dynamics beyond broken symmetries.

### [16] [Radial kinks in the boson stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13923)
*Tian-Chi Ma,Xiang-Yu Wang,Hai-Qing Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines the time evolution of radial kinks in boson stars with varying compactness, revealing that higher compactness slows kink motion toward the star's origin and potentially allows new kinks post-collision with the origin. Kinks may serve as probes into dense astrophysical objects, such as black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of kinks in boson stars contributes to exploring the internal structure of dense astrophysical objects, potentially including black holes.

Method: The research involves analyzing the dynamics of boson stars with different compactnesses, simulating or calculating the movement and interaction of radial kinks.

Result: Higher compactness boson stars have slower moving kinks; collisions with the origin may result in new kinks in highly compact stars. The findings suggest that kinks can probe the internal structures of such extreme objects.

Conclusion: This research provides evidence that radial kinks in boson stars could be used as probes to investigate their internal structures, potentially including those of black holes in astrophysical contexts.

Abstract: In this work, we study the time evolution of radial kinks in the background
of boson stars. In particular, we consider two types of boson stars: the
massive boson star and the solitonic boson star. For each boson star, we study
the dynamics of the kinks with four different compactnesses. We observe that
the greater the compactness is, the slower the kinks move towards the origin of
the boson stars, indicating that the compactness will hinder the kinks to
collide with the origin. Additionally, it is found that when the boson star is
highly compact, a new kink may turn out after the kink colliding with the
origin, instead of immediately dissipating into the background. We then propose
that the radial kinks may potentially serve as a means to probe the internal
structures of dense astrophysical objects, even the interior structure of black
holes.

TL;DR: The paper argues that wormholes in Unimodular Gravity require exotic matter, similar to General Relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the feasibility of traversable wormholes in Unimodular Gravity using barotropic equations of state and demonstrates that exotic matter is necessary for their existence.

Method: The authors analyze the properties of barotropic wormholes within Unimodular Gravity and compare the requirements for traversable wormholes to those in General Relativity.

Result: The study concludes that, like in General Relativity, traversable wormholes in Unimodular Gravity require exotic matter to satisfy the energy conditions.

Conclusion: The findings reinforce the necessity of exotic matter in creating traversable wormholes in Unimodular Gravity, aligning with established results in General Relativity.

Abstract: The paper entitled Unimodular Gravity Traversable Wormholes by Agrawal et al.
examined the properties of barotropic wormholes without tidal forces within the
framework of Unimodular Gravity. Our analysis demonstrates that their
conclusion regarding the possibility of sustaining such wormhole configurations
with ordinary matter is not entirely accurate. We establish that exotic matter
remains necessary for these wormhole solutions in Unimodular Gravity, in
accordance with the long-established theoretical constraints already identified
in General Relativity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The geometric foundations of General Relativity are revisited, with
particular attention to its gauge invariance, as a key to understanding the
true nature of spacetime. Beyond the common image of spacetime as a deformable
'fabric' filling the Universe, curvature is interpreted as the dynamic
interplay between matter and interacting fields; a view already emphasized by
Einstein and Weyl, but sometimes overlooked in the literature. Building on
these tools, a Newtonian framework is reconstructed that captures essential
aspects of cosmology, showing how classical intuition can coexist with modern
geometric insights. This perspective shifts the focus from substance to
relationships, offering a fresh magnifying glass through which to reinterpret
gravitational dynamics and the large-scale structure of the Universe. The
similarities of this approach with other recent, more ambitious ones carried
out at the quantum level are quite remarkable.

Abstract: We consider the path-integral quantization of a minisuperspace cut-and-paste
Lorentzian wormhole connecting two Minkowski spacetimes. The dynamics of the
throat radius as a function of proper time is governed by a non-local effective
action derived by an application of the Israel junction condition formalism.
Within a saddle-point approximation of the propagator describing the evolution
from an initial to a final throat radius, we show that topology-changing
transitions are suppressed by the Jacobi determinant. In addition, we analyze
the gravitational thermodynamics of the wormhole spacetime by a Wick rotation
of the Israel-Lanczos equations in the presence of a thin-shell source. The
resulting Euclideanized field equations are assumed to originate from a
Euclidean effective gravity-matter action, which enters the path-integral
representation of the gravitational canonical partition function. Therefrom we
associate a temperature given by the inverse period of solutions, as well as a
gravitational entropy as functions of the surface energy density and equation
of state parameter of the shell. Both quantities are sourced entirely by the
discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature across the junction. We show how this
result can be applied to deduce a thermodynamic first law as the differential
version of the conservation equation relating the effective mass of the shell
to its surface pressure.

### [21] [Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957)
*Jan Heisig*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new interferometric architecture for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves using closed optical loops that accumulate phase shifts coherently. The design is intended to surpass the cosmic microwave background constraints on gravitational wave backgrounds. The proposed detector reaches near this upper limit within 10^4 seconds using existing infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting gravitational waves in the kilohertz and higher frequency ranges helps probe the early universe's conditions at energy scales far higher than current cosmic microwave background techniques. Overcoming the BBN bound requires a sensitive detector system. A promising approach is to use closed optical loops that amplify gravitational wave-induced phase shifts over multiple traversals. Such systems can produce sharp, narrowband resonances that can be detected and used to identify gravitational wave backgrounds. Detecting these high-frequency waves could provide unique insights into early universe physics, including high-energy density scenarios that might have occurred just after the big bang.

Method: The research describes the design and sensitivity analysis of a loop interferometer architecture. The gravitational wave-induced phase shifts accumulate coherently over many traversals of the loop, enhancing the sensitivity of the system. The paper specifies that the design is compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, which is a large-scale, laser-interferometric gravitational wave detector. The finesse of the loops is set to approximately 500, allowing for finesse values that accumulate sufficient phase shifts to detect the desired gravitational waves. The researchers perform a projection of the sensitivity of this setup, estimating that it can approach and surpass the BBN sensitivity six orders of magnitude higher in frequency after approximately one year of operation.

Result: Sensitivity projections indicate that a closed-loop system with loop parameters compatible with Einstein Telescope infrastructure, such as finesse around 500 for square or triangular loops, can detect a stochastic gravitational wave background near or beyond the BBN limit within a kilohertz of integration over a year. This result suggests that this new interferometric architecture is a feasible and high-performing method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves. The predictable comb structure of the resonances provides a distinct experimental signature, simplifying the detection of such weak signals. The coherence in phase shifts enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, exceeding the upper noise floor set by the cosmic microwave background and even surpassing it in some frequency bands.

Conclusion: The proposed method using closed-loop interferometers offers a realistic approach to testing stochastic high-frequency gravitational waves. The sensitivity projections, especially considering Einstein Telescope infrastructure, demonstrate that the system can potentially surpass existing specially designed stochastic gravitational wave detectors. The predictable comb structure provides a clear signature, making this an efficient and reliable experimental design. High-frequency sensitivity is critical for cosmological applications, such as detecting relic gravitational waves from inflationary periods, which can inform our understanding of the early universe and high-energy processes that occurred at temperatures much higher than later epochs.

Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe
of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic
microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV.
Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We
propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in
which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over
many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable
comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or
triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope
infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that
approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one
year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and
distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave
backgrounds.

Abstract: With the upcoming third-generation gravitational-wave detectors comes the
need to build complete, faithful, and fast waveform models for
asymmetric-mass-ratio compact binaries. Most efforts within the self-force
community have focused on modeling these binaries' inspiral regime, but for
ground-based detectors the systems' final merger can represent the dominant
part of the signal. Recent work by three of us has extended the multiscale
self-force framework through the transition-to-plunge and merger-ringdown
regimes for nonspinning binaries. In this paper, we generalize the
next-to-next-to-leading-order transition-to-plunge waveform model to include
the spin of the primary black hole. We also improve the construction of
composite inspiral-transition waveform models by performing a change of
variables on the binary's mechanical phase space during the transition to
plunge. We provide detailed discussions of our numerical implementation and
comparisons with numerical relativity simulations.

Motivation: To provide accurate gravitational waveforms that meet the sensitivity requirements of advanced detectors like LISA.

Method: High-resolution simulations, quasi-circular, non-precessing binary black holes, and gravitational wave extraction methods like Cauchy characteristic extraction and finite-radius extraction.

Result: The waveform accuracy shows the smallest errors at around $O(10^{-3})$ near the merger, with the dominant (2,2) mode having mismatches of up to $O(10^{-5})$ to $O(10^{-7})$.

Conclusion: The released waveforms are of sufficiently high accuracy and are publicly available, representing a valuable resource for gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: We present the second release of the $\texttt{GR-Athena++}$ waveform catalog,
comprising four new quasi-circular, non-precessing, spinning binary black hole
simulations. These simulations are performed at high resolutions and represent
a step toward generating high-fidelity gravitational waveforms that can
eventually meet the accuracy requirements of upcoming next-generation
detectors, including LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope.
Gravitational waves are extracted at future null infinity ( $\mathscr{I}^{+}$)
using both Cauchy characteristic extraction and finite-radius extraction. For
each simulation, we provide strain data across multiple resolutions and analyze
waveform accuracy via convergence studies and self-mismatch analyses. The
absolute phase and relative amplitude differences reach their largest values
near the merger, while the smallest errors are of order $\mathscr{O}(10^{-2})$
and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-3})$, respectively. A self-mismatch analysis of the
dominant $(2,2)$ mode yields mismatches between $\mathscr{O}(10^{-5})$ and
$\mathscr{O}(10^{-7})$ for a total binary mass of $10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the
frequency range $[0.002, 0.1]$ Hz using LISA noise curve. All waveforms are
publicly available via $\texttt{ScholarSphere}$.

Abstract: We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of
Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1
neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh
and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny
platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the
computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX
infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs,
running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We
validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results
obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with
simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state.
Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in
the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling
performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful
tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger
astrophysics.

Abstract: We construct spherically symmetric boson star solutions in $D \in \{4,5,6\}$
spacetime dimensions, considering the effects of both a quartic
self-interaction term and a solitonic potential. We then perform a perturbative
analysis, generalizing the pulsation equations to arbitrary dimension and
potential and hence demonstrating the existence of radially stable
higher-dimensional boson star solutions. We supplement these linear results
with perturbed and unperturbed nonlinear dynamical evolutions in spherical
symmetry, obtained using a dimensional reduction that allows us to evolve
spacetimes with any number of background dimensions using the same numerical
framework, while preserving the full gauge freedom of standard approaches to
numerical relativity. The results of these evolutions indicate that the
solutions we identify as perturbatively stable are indeed generally stable to
nonlinear spherical dynamics.

Motivation: 研究 Bianchi I 宇宙在修正量子余弦学中的动力学行为，意在理解早期宇宙的演化和奇点问题。 Quantum 边界理论 (LQC) 已证明能通过量子跃迁解除大爆炸奇点，而本研究通过 mLQC-I 探讨 如何更有效地抑制异向性，增强对早期宇宙模型的描述能力。

Method: 分析 Bianchi I 宇宙在 mLQC-I 框架下的动力学行为，比较了不同模型的异向性抑制机制。 建立了适当的哈密顿量和量子化程序，求解了量子跃迁的演化方程。利用数值模拟技术，追踪了剪切随时间的演化。

Result: 研究揭示，在 mLQC-I 中，量子跃迁抑制了剪切，使其在量子深层迅速减为零，导致宇宙直接进入均匀各向同性的阶段。这一机制独立于收敛的材料场，并通过膨胀到 macroscale 的空间方向生成有序宇宙。 mLQC-I 模型解决了奇点问题，并比其他模型更有效地失误异向性，证实其在描述早期宇宙中的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，在修正的量子环路余弦学（mLQC-I）中，Bianchi I 宇宙表现出通过量子跃迁恢复各向同性及有效地抑制异向性的特性。这种动态导致宇宙在量子时期后直接进入均匀各向同性的阶段，无需微调。这些发现不仅解除奇点，还提供了比现有模型更有效的减小异向性的途径，因而 mLQC-I 在描述早期宇宙演化中具有重要意义。

Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum
cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for
isotropization. As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are
resolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature:
following the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to
zero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the
collapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization.
Consequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic
scales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the
quantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not
only resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for
suppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability
as a description of the early universe.

Abstract: We characterize the local instability of pressureless Friedmann spacetimes to
radial perturbation at the Big Bang. The analysis is based on a formulation of
the Einstein-Euler equations in self-similar variables $(t,\xi)$, with
$\xi=r/t$, conceived to realize the critical ($k=0$) Friedmann spacetime as a
stationary solution whose character as an unstable saddle rest point $SM$ is
determined via an expansion of smooth solutions in even powers of $\xi$. The
eigenvalues of $SM$ imply the $k\neq0$ Friedmann spacetimes are unstable
solutions within the unstable manifold of $SM$. We prove that all solutions
smooth at the center of symmetry agree with a Friedmann spacetime at leading
order in $\xi$, and with an eye toward Cosmology, we focus on $\mathcal{F}$,
the set of solutions which agree with a $k<0$ Friedmann spacetime at leading
order, providing the maximal family into which generic underdense radial
perturbations of the unstable critical Friedmann spacetime will evolve. We
prove solutions in $\mathcal{F}$ generically accelerate away from Friedmann
spacetimes at intermediate times but decay back to the same leading order
Friedmann spacetime asymptotically as $t\to\infty$. Thus instabilities inherent
in the Einstein-Euler equations provide a natural mechanism for an accelerated
expansion without recourse to a cosmological constant or dark energy.

Abstract: Gravitational wave interferometers are disrupted by various types of
nonstationary noise, referred to as glitch noise, that affect data analysis and
interferometer sensitivity. The accurate identification and classification of
glitch noise are essential for improving the reliability of gravitational wave
observations. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised
machine learning for classifying images with nonstationary noise in the KAGRA
O3GK data. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with spectral
clustering, we identified eight distinct glitch noise categories. The latent
variables obtained from VAE were dimensionally compressed, visualized in
three-dimensional space, and classified using spectral clustering to better
understand the glitch noise characteristics of KAGRA during the O3GK period.
Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised learning for efficient
glitch noise classification, which may in turn potentially facilitate
interferometer upgrades and the development of future third-generation
gravitational wave observatories.

### [29] [A unified model of dark energy and inflation from the Markov-Mukhanov action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14416)

Conclusion: 这一研究提供了一种统一的框架，解释了暗能量与通货膨胀的相互作用机制，为解决暗能量问题提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the
Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter
sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on
the energy density of the matter content. We assume that the coupling function
encodes the UV corrections to the standard model of cosmology and we determine
the form of the coupling that allows for the dark energy component to be
dynamical and act as the inflaton field in the early universe. Interestingly we
show that our model, in order to account for inflation, prefers a dark energy
equation of state with $w$ close but not equal to $-1$ in agreement with the
latest DESI data.

Abstract: Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum
gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that
ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom.
Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of
this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight
the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of
quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the
Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of
classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of
couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We
discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their
thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal
modes and shadows.

Abstract: A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract
model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes
from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity.
In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the
equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime

Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine
the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the
associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our
analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients
suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we
emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be
exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.

### [32] [Quantum confinement of scalar bosons in the Bonnor-Melvin spacetime: uniform magnetic field and rainbow gravity effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14789)
*Omar Mustafa,Abdullah Guvendi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了凯 outlining an exact analytical study of Klein-Gordon (KG) scalar bosons and their antimatter counterparts in Bonnor-Melvin (BM)时空 under a uniform magnetic field，with rainbow gravity (RG) corrections and a positive cosmological constant. The spacetime is partitioned into infinite confinement domains, and within the first domain, the KG equation reduces to a hypergeometric differential equation. Two representative RG models produce Planck-scale bounded and symmetric particle-antiparticle spectra. A notable feature is the collapse of magnetic quantum states m ≠ 0 onto m = 0 for radial excitations. Stronger magnetic fields enhance spatial localization, confining bosons into static or rotating ring-like structures. These results demonstrate how gravitational confinement, spacetime topology, magnetic fields, and Planck-scale corrections jointly shape the spectral and spatial properties of relativistic quantum fields in curved, magnetized environments.

Motivation: 研究粒子物理和量子场论与引力理论的关系，借助数学模型理解引力、磁性和量子尺度的影响于粒子的能级和空间分布，尤其是在膨胀以及曲率较高的时空中，如宇宙大爆炸模型中的现象。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，宇宙常数引起的时空分区、磁场的兼具影响以及雨滴引力效应协同作用，形成了几种不同维度的粒子和反粒子束缚态，具有重要理论和潜在的宇宙学意义。该模型可为解释早期宇宙中的粒子-反粒子对称性生成和能量分布提供理论依据。

Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of Klein-Gordon (KG) scalar bosons and
antibosons confined in the Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime under a uniform
magnetic field, incorporating rainbow gravity (RG) corrections with a positive
cosmological constant. The cosmological constant partitions spacetime into an
infinite sequence of confinement domains bounded by impenetrable barriers.
Within the first allowed domain, the KG equation reduces to a hypergeometric
differential equation, yielding closed-form expressions for both the energy
spectra and the radial wavefunctions in terms of hypergeometric polynomials.
Two representative RG models, inspired by the Magueijo-Smolin framework and
loop quantum gravity (LQG), produce Planck-scale bounded, symmetric
particle-antiparticle spectra. A distinctive feature of the curved magnetized
geometry is the collapse of all magnetic quantum states $m \neq 0$ onto the $m
= 0$ level for each radial excitation, a degeneracy absent in flat spacetime.
Increasing the cosmological constant partially lifts this collapse,
establishing a direct link between the global spacetime curvature and the local
quantum structure. Radial probability density analysis further shows that
stronger magnetic fields enhance spatial localization, confining bosons into
static or rotating ring-like configurations with nodal architectures that
evolve systematically with quantum numbers. These findings reveal how
gravitational confinement, topology, magnetic fields, and Planck-scale
corrections jointly govern the spectral and spatial properties of relativistic
quantum fields in curved and magnetized backgrounds.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate asymptotically flat non-exotic traversable
wormhole geometries within the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos in the
framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity. Two functional forms of the theory are
considered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R,
L_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are
obtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density
profiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution
influences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to
verify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic
matter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total
gravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole's physical
viability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and
its implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational
signatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within
$f(R, L_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter
environments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole
geometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new
insights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and
astrophysical observations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum materials can host original electronic phases that
arise from the interplay of electronic correlations, symmetry and topology. In
particular, the spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry that acts
simultaneously on the pseudospin and the spatial degree of freedom realizes a
nematic ordering. We report evidence of a quantum Hall valley nematic phase
with an underlying SU(3) order parameter space obtained by a spontaneous
polarization between the threefold degenerate valley pseudospins in Pb1-xSnxSe
quantum wells. In the presence of a Zeeman field, we demonstrate a further
control of the nematic ordering with an explicit symmetry breaking. Evidence of
both spontaneous and explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking, reminiscent of the quark
flavor paradigm, is of fundamental interest to shape the many body physics in a
SU(3) system.

Conclusion: 提出了对三维受约束铁电材料进行重整化群分析的新理论框架，解释了有序参数的显著异常维数。

Abstract: We study the critical behavior of a Landau-type theory for ferroelectrics in
which the polarization order parameter $\vec{P}$ is subject to a
divergence-free constraint, such that only loop-like polarization
configurations contribute to the partition function. This constraint forces the
number of components of the field $\vec{P}$ to equal the spatial dimensionality
$D$, allowing a natural extension of the present theory to $O(N)$ models with
$N=D$. Renormalization group analysis reveals critical behavior beyond the
conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In particular, the order
parameter acquires a remarkably large anomalous dimension, with $\eta\approx
0.239$ in three dimensions -- significantly exceeding the value $\eta\approx
0.034$ typical of the $O(3)$ universality class. This is due to an emergent
gauge symmetry originating with the local constraint.

### [36] [Comparative study of phonon-limited carrier transport in the Weyl semimetal TaAs family](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14048)
*Shashi B. Mishra,Zhe Liu,Sabyasachi Tiwari,Feliciano Giustino,Elena R. Margine*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic first-principles study of phonon-limited transport in the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals. The study uses the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. Electrical conductivities of four compounds—NbP, TaAs, NbAs, and TaP—show varying levels of conductivity, influenced by factors like Fermi velocities, scattering rates, carrier pockets, and doping effects. The results provide insights into the transport mechanisms in these systems, emphasizing the role of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics in shaping their electronic response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the phonon-limited transport in Weyl semimetals like TaAs and its derivatives is crucial for advancing the field of condensed matter physics, particularly in exploring the electronic properties and potential applications in low-dimensional systems.

Method: The research employs an ab initio Boltzmann transport equation approach to systematically investigate the phonon-limited transport in the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals. This method combines fundamental principles of quantum mechanics with transport theory to analyze the electrical conductivity of these materials.

Result: The study reveals that among the four compounds examined—NbP, TaAs, NbAs, and TaP—NbP exhibits the highest conductivity, attributed to its large Fermi velocities which counterbalance its stronger scattering rates. Conversely, TaAs shows the lowest conductivity, linked to reduced carrier pockets and limited carrier velocities. NbP's conductivity remains largely unaffected by small hole or electron doping, whereas TaAs exhibits pronounced electron-hole asymmetry. NbAs and TaP display intermediate conductivity levels, which correlate with their specific Fermi surface topologies and scattering phase space characteristics. These findings offer a detailed understanding of the transport mechanisms within the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals and underscore the significant influence of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics on their electronic behavior.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive microscopic analysis of the transport mechanisms in the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals. By employing the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation, the study successfully elucidates how phonon-limited transport is influenced by material-specific factors such as Fermi velocities, scattering rates, carrier pockets, and doping effects. The findings not only deepen our understanding of these materials but also highlight the critical role of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics in determining their electronic response, which is valuable for both fundamental research and potential applications in novel electronic devices.

Abstract: We present a systematic first-principles study of phonon-limited transport in
the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals using the ab initio Boltzmann transport
equation. The calculated electrical conductivities show excellent agreement
with experimental data for high-quality samples, confirming that transport in
these systems is predominantly limited by phonon scattering. Among the four
compounds, NbP achieves the highest conductivity, governed primarily by its
large Fermi velocities that offset its stronger scattering rates. In contrast,
TaAs displays the lowest conductivity, linked to reduced carrier pockets and
limited carrier velocities. Additionally, NbP conductivity remains largely
unaffected by small hole or electron doping, whereas TaAs exhibits pronounced
electron-hole asymmetry. NbAs and TaP show intermediate behavior, reflecting
their Fermi surface topologies and scattering phase space. These findings
provide microscopic insight into the transport mechanisms of the TaAs family
and emphasize the critical role of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics in
shaping their electronic response.

*Ayelet Ben-Kish Sharvit,Yoav Green*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework for optimizing the design of nanofluidic devices by combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The study investigates the relationship between voltage, geometry, and surface charge densities in bipolar nanochannels for water desalination and energy harvesting. The key finding is that the system response is governed by a parameter η, which reflects the interplay between voltage and the geometric and charge density ratios of the charged regions. The framework allows for a simplified phase space representation of the system response under different voltage conditions, facilitating more efficient optimization of nanofluidic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for clean water and renewable energy is driving advancements in nanofluidic devices. However, the underlying physics of these complex systems is not fully understood, making it difficult to optimize their performance through empirical methods alone. This paper aims to address these challenges by providing a theoretical and numerical framework for improving the design of nanofluidic devices.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis with numerical simulations to develop a unified framework for optimizing nanofluidic devices. The research focuses on the relationship between voltage and the geometry and charge densities of charged regions in bipolar nanochannels. Numerical simulations are used to model the system response under different voltage conditions, and theoretical models are developed to explain the observed deviations in current-voltage responses.

Result: The study demonstrates that the system response in bipolar nanochannels is governed by the parameter η, which depends on the ratio of geometry and surface charge densities of the charged regions. The framework provides a simplified phase space representation of the system response under both low and high voltage conditions. The comparison of numerical simulations with theoretical models reveals insights into the deviations in current-voltage responses, enabling a better understanding of the system behavior.

Conclusion: This study offers a promising approach for optimizing the design of nanofluidic devices by integrating theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The framework presented in the paper can help reduce the time and resources required to optimize nanofluidic devices while improving the interpretation of experimental and simulation results.

Abstract: Bipolar nanoporous membranes and bipolar nanochannels are used in water
desalination and energy-harvesting systems that provide clean water and green
energy, respectively. The growing need for both requires continuous improvement
of their performance. However, the underlying physics of these complex systems
is still not fully understood, making empirical optimization slow and
inefficient. In this work, we combine theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations to develop a unified framework for improving the design of
nanofluidic devices. We show that the system response is governed by the
interplay between the applied voltage and a parameter $\eta$, which depends on
the ratio of geometry and surface charge densities of both charged regions. At
low voltages, the response is mostly determined by $\eta$, allowing its
dependence to be represented by a simplified phase space. At high voltages,
this phase space becomes oversimplified. To demonstrate the framework's
robustness, we scan a range of configurations, from unipolar channels (single
charged region) to bipolar channels (positive and negative segments). We
compare the numerically simulated current-voltage responses with three
theoretical models, which are limiting scenarios within the phase space, and
explain the observed deviations. These findings can help reduce the time and
resources required to optimize nanofluidic devices and improve the
interpretation of experiments and simulations.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for simulating
nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with explicit inclusion of geometric phase (GP)
effects. Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model
that can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections,
avoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate
parameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization
scheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to
the adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified
framework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry
curvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate
representation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method
incorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic
intersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy)
independent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter
(e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with
theoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to
geometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying
quantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase
effects play a significant role. The elliptical intersection and geometric
phase effect opens avenue for the design and discovery of degenerate materials.
It produces a fresh look to help develop a new kind of spectroscopy and
potential qubit applications. This simple Hamiltonian reveals a pathological
phase protection effect E = kr, where k is real, that has great utility in a
new spectroscopy design.

Abstract: Electronic devices are engineered at increasingly smaller length scales; new
metrologies to understand nanoscale thermodynamics are needed. Temperature and
pressure are fundamental thermodynamic quantities whose nanoscale measurement
is challenging as physical contact inevitably perturbs the system. Here we
demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning
electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures
and pressures. KDTh detects local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline
samples by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced
using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). We map lattice parameters and
temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe
across the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature
sensitivity is 2.2 K/$\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting
the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission
electron microscopy. KDTh can operate in both transmission (transmission
Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction,
EBSD) modes.

Abstract: Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit
interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal
superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a
model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave
superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a
two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by
utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented
perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we
achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through
stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.

Abstract: A twisted honeycomb bilayer exhibits a moir\'e superstructure that is
composed of a hexagonal arrangement of AB and BA stacked domains separated by
domain boundaries. In the case of twisted bilayer graphene, the application of
an electric field normal to the bilayer leads to the opening of inverted band
gaps in the AB and BA stacked domains. The inverted band gaps result in the
formation of a two-dimensional triangular network of counterpropagating valley
protected helical domain boundary states, also referred to as the quantum
valley Hall effect. Owing to spin-orbit coupling and buckling, the quantum
valley Hall effect in twisted bilayer silicene and germanene is more complex
than in twisted bilayer graphene. We found that there is a range of electric
fields for which the spin degree of freedom is locked to the valley degree of
freedom of the electrons in the quantum valley Hall states, resulting in a
stronger topological protection. For electric fields smaller than the
aforementioned range the twisted bilayer does not exhibit the quantum valley
Hall effect, whereas for larger electric fields the spin-valley locking is
lifted and the emergent quantum valley Hall states are only valley-protected.

TL;DR: 利用高频率光进行Floquet工程可以动态控制量子材料中的拓扑相位。虽然在三维Dirac系统中圆偏振光可以利用能隙开启相变，但这在 quas 2D Dirac材料中不大容易。我们发现，在具有二次动量项的多层Bi₂Se₃薄膜中，经人工合成光强线偏振光可以驱动二次动量项中的相变，导致环路边界通道。实验表明，光强下即可实现相变。这些结果为基于二次动量的Floquet拓扑工程提供了实验基础。

Abstract: Floquet engineering with high-frequency light offers dynamic control over
topological phases in quantum materials. While in 3D Dirac systems circularly
polarized light is known to induce topological phase transitions via gap
opening, linearly polarized light (LPL) has generally been considered
ineffective. Here we show that in quasi-2D Dirac materials the second-order
momentum term arising from the intersurface coupling can induce a topological
phase transition under LPL, leading to chiral edge channels. Considering an
ultrathin Bi$_2$Se$_3$ film as a representative system, we show that this
transition occurs at experimentally accessible light intensities. Our results
thus promote quasi-2D materials as viable platforms for light-controlled
topological phases, expanding the potential of Floquet topological engineering.

Method: 实验结合理论分析，通过高温下不同栅极偏置下的漏电流特性研究，结合电容伏特性分析捕获陷阱高度和迁移率变化。

Result: 在高温下，漏电流主要由Poole-Frenkel发射主导；低温下，捕获陷阱隧道效应显著，导致漏电流下降。反向栅极偏置下漏电流随时间呈现明显反向循环特征。

Conclusion: 温度显著影响GaNHEMT的漏电机制，尤其在低温区捕获陷阱隧道效应更为明显，这为开发低温适用的GaNHEMT材料和工艺提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This work provides a detailed mapping of various mechanisms of
surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN HEMTs across a temperature range from
room to cryogenic levels. Two-dimensional variable-range hopping is observed at
small gate bias. Under higher reverse gate bias, the leakage is dominated by
the Poole--Frenkel emission above 220 K, but gradually transitions to the
trap-assisted tunneling below 220 K owing to the frozen-trap effect. The trap
barrier height extracted from the gate leakage current under the upward gate
sweep is 0.65 V, which is 12\% higher than that from the downward sweep. The
gate leakage current as a function of the gate bias exhibits clockwise
hysteresis loops above 220 K but counterclockwise ones below 220 K. This
remarkable opposite hysteresis phenomenon is thoroughly explained by the trap
mechanisms.

Abstract: In disordered lattices, itinerant electrons typically undergo Anderson
localization due to random phase interference, which suppresses their motion.
By contrast, in flat-band systems where electrons are intrinsically localized
owing to their vanishing group velocity, the role of disorder remains elusive.
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at the magic angle $\sim 1.1^\circ$ provides a
representative flat-band platform to investigate this problem. Here, we perform
an atomistic tight-binding quantum transport calculation on the interplay
between disorder and flat-bands in TBG devices. This non-phenomenological
approach provides direct evidence that moderate disorder enhances conductance,
whereas stronger disorder restores localization, revealing a disorder-driven
delocalization-to-localization transport behavior. The underlying physical
mechanism is understood by an effective inter-moir{\'e} tunneling strength via
spectral flow analysis of a disordered TBG cylinder. Moreover, by comparing
magic-angle and large-angle TBG, we demonstrate qualitatively distinct disorder
responses tied to the presence of flat-bands. Our quantitative results
highlight the unconventional role of disorder in flat-band moir{\'e} materials
and offer insights into the observation of the fractional quantum anomalous
Hall effect in disordered moir{\'e} systems.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper presents a triple-dot quantum system functioning as a refrigerator that cools using a nonthermal energy resource while minimizing fluctuations in cooling power compared to input fluctuations. The device operates in two modes: one leveraging nonthermal properties and another using information. The nonthermal mode shows significantly lower cooling-power fluctuations, suggesting enhanced precision. Cross-correlations between inputs and outputs further confirm the distinct operational principles of the two modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of nanoscale heat engines and refrigerators using quantum dots is a key area in nanotechnology and thermodynamics, aiming to harness thermal fluctuations for practical applications. advancing our understanding of such systems can lead to more efficient devices for energy management.

Method: The researchers utilized full counting statistics and stochastic trajectory analysis to study the device's performance, focusing on cooling-power precision and employing uncertainty relations from thermodynamics and kinetics. Two operational modes were analyzed based on information and nonthermal properties of the resource.

Result: The findings reveal two distinct operational modes for the triple-dot system. In one mode, the system uses information, while the other exploits the nonthermal nature of the resource. The latter mode shows cooling-power fluctuations that are an order of magnitude lower than input fluctuations, indicating improved precision.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the development of more efficient quantum refrigerators by demonstrating that utilizing a nonthermal resource can lead to enhanced precision in cooling processes without significant energy input.

Abstract: Quantum-dot systems serve as nanoscale heat engines exploiting thermal
fluctuations to perform a useful task. Here, we investigate a multi-terminal
triple-dot system, operating as a refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold
electronic contact. In contrast to standard heat engines, this system exploits
a nonthermal resource. This has the intriguing consequence that cooling can
occur without extracting energy from the resource on average -- a seemingly
demonic action -- while, however, requiring the resource to fluctuate. Using
full counting statistics and stochastic trajectories, we analyze the
performance of the device in terms of the cooling-power precision, employing
performance quantifiers motivated by the thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty
relations. We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on
two operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the
nonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes
significantly differ in precision. In particular, the regime exploiting the
nonthermal properties of the resource can have cooling-power fluctuations that
are suppressed with respect to the input fluctuations by an order of magnitude.
We also substantiate the interpretation of the two different working principles
by analyzing cross-correlations between input and output heat currents and
information flow.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions extended to three dimensions form string-like objects
whose fundamental role remains largely unexplored. We show that skyrmion
strings can terminate on a N\'eel-type domain wall (DW), realizing a magnetic
analogue of a Dirichlet(D)-brane soliton. While an isolated N\'eel DW tends to
rotate into a Bloch DW, the N\'eel DW is stabilized when a skyrmion string ends
on it. Unlike field-theory D-branes, the Bloch-type DMI produces linear rather
than logarithmic DW bending, and the strings retain finite width far from the
DW, circumventing singular behavior. Furthermore, the repulsive interaction
between strings allows periodic multi-junction solutions, yielding a square
lattice of alternating strings and local DW deformations. These results
establish magnetic skyrmion strings as fundamental strings that can end on a
D-brane.

Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the energy level spectrum and thus the
optical response in semiconductors. In this respect, lead-halide perovskite
nanocrystals represent a unique system, for which the interaction with optical
phonons is particularly strong, giving rise to a ladder of multiple exciton
states which can be optically excited with femtosecond pulses. We establish a
new regime of coherent exciton-polaron dynamics with exceptionally long
coherence times (T2 ~300 ps) in an ensemble of CsPbI3 nanocrystals embedded in
a glass matrix. Using transient two-pulse photon echo at 2 K temperature, we
observe quantum beats between the exciton-polaron states. Within a four-level
model, we directly quantify the exciton-phonon coupling strength through the
Huang-Rhys factors of 0.05-0.1 and 0.02-0.04 for low-energy optical phonons
with energies of 3.2 and 5.1 meV, respectively. The pronounced size dependence
of both coupling strengths and phonon lifetimes offers a path to tune the
optical transitions between polaron states and to tailor the coherent optical
dynamics in perovskite semiconductors for solid-state quantum technologies.

current--noise spectra and linear--response conductance at low frequencies of
the electromagnetic field. At high frequencies, vacuum catastrophe is shown to
be avoided by the presence of Casimir force. At low frequencies, the quantum
effect associated with one--dimensional structures under the conditions of
ballistic transport typical at the nanometric scale length are briefly reviewed
in terms of a universal quasi-particle approach. The case of a photon gas

Abstract: We introduce a minimal interface-scattering mechanism that produces a sizable
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in metal/ferromagnet bilayers (e.g.,
Pt/YIG) without invoking bulk spin or orbital Hall currents. In a
$\delta$-layer model with interfacial exchange and Rashba spin-orbit coupling,
charge transfer at a high-quality interface creates a spin-selective phase
condition (interfacial spin filtering) that suppresses backscattering for one
spin projection while enhancing momentum relaxation for the other. The
resulting resistance anisotropy peaks at an optimal metal thickness of a few
nanometers, quantitatively reproducing the thickness and angular dependences
typically attributed to spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), as well as its
characteristic magnitude. Remarkably, the maximal AMR scales linearly with the
smaller of the two coupling strengths - exchange or spin-orbit, highlighting a
mechanism fundamentally distinct from SMR. Our scattering formulation maps onto
Boltzmann boundary conditions and predicts other clear discriminants from SMR,
including strong sensitivity to interfacial charge transfer and disorder.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two
AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities
are analyzed as functions of angle between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs
$\theta$. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta
\to \pi$, while in the weak AM phase it remains finite. Introducing a normal
metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge
conductivity. In the strong phase, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons,
whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak phase. These results
highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic
applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic
devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be
utilized in electronic devices.

TL;DR: Hybrid altermagnets can exhibit a second-order anomalous Hall response when driven by electric fields, with the signal influenced by the underlying symmetry of the material.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex magnetic materials and controlling their transport properties is key for spintronic applications.

Method: Studied a 2D Rashba-coupled hybrid altermagnet interpolating between d-wave and xy-wave symmetries using linear response theory.

Result: Electric field-induced second-order Hall currents exist, dependent on symmetry; symmetry differentiation at specific doping levels possible.

Conclusion: Hybrid altermagnets offer promising platform for nonlinear transport and spintronic applications with controllable responses.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of compensated magnets with
momentum-dependent spin splittings and unusual transport properties, even
without a net magnetization. In the presence of combined four-fold rotation and
time-reversal ($C_4\mathcal{T}$) symmetry, linear and also second-order, driven
by a Berry curvature dipole, anomalous Hall responses are forbidden in any pure
$d$-wave altermagnet. Nevertheless, here we find that the nontrivial quantum
metric of the occupied Bloch states allows for an electric field induced Berry
curvature dipole, which generates a strong and tunable second-order Hall
current, enabling it to be switched on or off by simply adjusting the relative
orientation between the symmetry-reducing dc field and the ac probe field.
Specifically, we investigate the electric field induced second-order anomalous
Hall response in a two-dimensional Rashba-coupled hybrid altermagnet that
interpolates between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ ($B_{1g}$) and $d_{xy}$ ($B_{2g}$)
altermagnet symmetry, motivated by recent proposals for mixed-symmetry states.
Crucially, the nonlinear signal is highly sensitive to the underlying symmetry
of the altermagnetic order at specific doping levels, offering a purely
electrical method to distinguish distinct altermagnetic orders. Our results
position hybrid altermagnets as a promising platform for controllable nonlinear
transport and spintronic applications.

Conclusion: 该研究证明，混合位点可以作为调节 skyrmion 轨迹和有效霍尔响应的实用调节器，为基于 skyrmion 的记忆和逻辑装置的设计提供了设计指南。

Abstract: We investigate the driven dynamics of a single skyrmion in a square lattice
of mixed pinning sites, where attractive and repulsive defects coexist using a
particle-based model. The mixed landscape yields directional locking at
$\theta_{\rm sk}=-45^\circ$ and flow at locked angles near the intrinsic
skyrmion Hall angle. By mapping defect strengths, we show that weaker
attraction lowers the depinning threshold, whereas stronger repulsion
stabilizes and broadens the $-45^\circ$ locking plateau. Moreover, combinations
of attractive and repulsive defect strengths allows control of directional
lockings and their force ranges. Defect size further tunes the response,
selecting among $-45^\circ$, $-50^\circ$, $-55^\circ$, and $\approx-59^\circ$.
These results establish mixed pinning as a practical knob to steer skyrmion
trajectories and the effective Hall response, providing design guidelines for
skyrmion-based memory and logic devices.

Abstract: Layered van der Waals materials offer novel opportunities for on-chip
waveguiding and development of integrated photonic circuits. In the strong
light-matter coupling regime, their nonlinear response can be significantly
enhanced, which is crucial for developing active photonic devices. However,
probing the nonlinearity of waveguide modes in subwavelength-thick structures
is challenging as they are not directly accessible from far-field. Here we
apply a novel nonlinear near-field spectroscopic technique based on a GaP solid
immersion lens and femtosecond laser excitation to study nonlinearity of guided
modes in monolayer WS$_2$ encapsulated in hBN under the strong light-matter
coupling regime. We reveal formation of exciton-polaritons with $\sim 50$ meV
Rabi splitting and demonstrate a pump-induced transition from strong to weak
coupling. Our results show that exciton resonance saturation and broadening
lead to an efficient nonlinear response of guided polaritons, which can be
employed for developing compact van der Waals photonic switches and modulators.

Motivation: In the era of AI and surgical robotics, reducing latency is critical for real-time decision-making in telesurgery.

Method: OCiC framework integrates ORCUs into optical communication pathways, achieving 69 tera-ops per second per channel with high inference fidelity.

Result: OCiC maintains 0.1% fidelity compared to CPU/GPU, and scales up to 10,000 km with stable performance.

Conclusion: OCiC enables reliable low-latency telesurgery via distributed photonic AI fabric, marking a significant advancement in medical AI and telemedicine.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing
intraoperative perception and decision-making in telesurgery, where physical
separation impairs sensory feedback and control. Despite advances in medical AI
and surgical robotics, conventional electronic AI architectures remain
fundamentally constrained by the compounded latency from serial processing of
inference and communication. This limitation is especially critical in
latency-sensitive procedures such as endovascular interventions, where delays
over 200 ms can compromise real-time AI reliability and patient safety. Here,
we introduce an Optical Computation-in-Communication (OCiC) framework that
reduces end-to-end latency significantly by performing AI inference
concurrently with optical communication. OCiC integrates Optical Remote
Computing Units (ORCUs) directly into the optical communication pathway, with
each ORCU experimentally achieving up to 69 tera-operations per second per
channel through spectrally efficient two-dimensional photonic convolution. The
system maintains ultrahigh inference fidelity within 0.1% of CPU/GPU baselines
on classification and coronary angiography segmentation, while intrinsically
mitigating cumulative error propagation, a longstanding barrier to deep optical
network scalability. We validated the robustness of OCiC through outdoor dark
fibre deployments, confirming consistent and stable performance across varying
environmental conditions. When scaled globally, OCiC transforms long-haul fibre
infrastructure into a distributed photonic AI fabric with exascale potential,
enabling reliable, low-latency telesurgery across distances up to 10,000 km and
opening a new optical frontier for distributed medical intelligence.

Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to explore and verify a fundamental prediction in quantum electrodynamics, specifically the vacuum magnetic birefringence effect, which has implications for our understanding of the quantum vacuum and its response to external fields.

Method: The experiment involves creating a 245-meter-long optical cavity stabilized by laser fields, which are then placed in a region filled with a string of 24 superconducting magnets arranged for the ALPS II experiment. A prototype setup with a 19-meter-long cavity is used to measure the effect without a magnetic field, and the results are projected to evaluate the sensitivity of the full-scale implementation.

Result: The results from the prototype setup indicate a measurable effect, suggesting that the proposed full-scale experiment could achieve high sensitivity in detecting the vacuum magnetic birefringence effect. This provides a foundation for further research and potential applications in precision metrology and fundamental physics.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates a method to measure the vacuum magnetic birefringence effect and shows that the proposed experiment could potentially achieve the desired sensitivity, opening up new avenues for studying quantum electrodynamics and its phenomena.

Abstract: The vacuum magnetic birefringence effect is a prediction of quantum
electrodynamics, that in the presence of a magnetic field vacuum behaves as a
non-linear medium, exhibiting a birefringence. In this work, an experiment is
proposed to measure this effect for the first time, by sensing the changes in
the frequencies of laser fields stabilized to the resonances of a 245 m long
optical cavity whose eigenmode propagates through a string of 24
superconducting magnets arranged for the ALPS II experiment. Results from a
prototype setup using a 19 m test cavity without a magnetic field are presented
and projected in terms of the sensitivity of the proposed full-scale
experiment.

Abstract: Reciprocity breaking at optical frequencies typically relies on bulky
magnets, dynamic modulation, or nonlinearities, all of which hinder chip-scale
integration and the handling of unpolarised light. We introduce a fully
passive, subwavelength metasurface that achieves polarisation-insensitive
one-way transparency by combining self-magnetised ferrite nanodisks in a vortex
state with symmetry-protected quasi-bound states in the continuum. The
metasurface exhibits a pure synthetic moving-medium response at optical
frequencies, yielding giant nonreciprocal directional dichroism. We report
near-unity values for both the transmittance contrast and the
emissivity-to-absorptivity ratio with experimentally widely available ferrite
materials, all under unpolarised illumination and without external bias. Using
temporal coupled-mode theory, we identify the design conditions necessary to
maximise directional dichroism: critical coupling, Huygens-type resonance
overlap, and strong inter-mode coupling. Furthermore, we propose a
deterministic, stamp-assisted protocol for imprinting arbitrary, uniform, or
patterned vortex configurations across large arrays of nanodisk meta-atoms,
enabling scalable fabrication. This work establishes a practical route toward
compact nonreciprocal photonics with applications in photonic gyrators,
nonreciprocal wavefront engineering, and nonreciprocal solar cell technologies.

Abstract: We develop a theory of two-dimensional Bloch-Landau-Zener (BLZ) oscillations
of wavepackets in incommensurate moir\'e lattices under the influence of a weak
linear gradient. Unlike periodic systems, aperiodic lattices lack translational
symmetry and therefore do not exhibit a conventional band-gap structure.
Instead, they feature a mobility edge, above which (in the optical context) all
modes become localized. When a linear gradient is applied to a moir\'e lattice,
it enables energy transfer between two or several localized modes, leading to
the oscillatory behavior referred to as BLZ oscillations. This phenomenon
represents simultaneous tunneling in real space and propagation constant
(energy) space, and it arises when quasi-resonance condition for propagation
constants and spatial proximity of interacting modes (together constituting a
selection rule) are met. The selection rule is controlled by the linear
gradient, whose amplitude and direction play a crucial role in determining the
coupling pathways and the resulting dynamics. We derive a multimode model
describing BLZ oscillations in the linear regime and analyze how both
attractive and repulsive nonlinearities affect their dynamics. The proposed
framework can be readily extended to other physical systems, including cold
atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates in aperiodic potentials.

Abstract: Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous
control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic
information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into
the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct
holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon
pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial
modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the
holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum
holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the
full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed
density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to
individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among
the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies
metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable
route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information
processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.

Abstract: The ability to control the spatial distribution of light, particularly in
deep sub-wavelength areas, is important for a range of materials science,
microscopy, and communications applications. Separately, materials science and
communications rely on the ability to temporally shape the evolution of
electromagnetic pulses. In this work we investigate theoretically the
propagation of ultrafast pulses inside hyperbolic metamaterials-based photonic
funnels, which have been recently used to achieve deep subwavelength
(wavelength/30) concentration of monochromatic mid-infrared light. By analyzing
the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the pulse-funnel interaction, we show
that photonic funnels, in general, broaden bandwidth-limited ultrafast Gaussian
pulses. We demonstrate that this broadening can be mitigated by pre-chirping
the incoming light, realizing simultaneous intensity enhancement and
spatio-temporal compression of mid-wave IR light in the all-semiconductor
"designer metal" funnel platform. Our analysis suggests that, in combination
with linear chirp, designer-metal-based photonic funnels can be utilized with
100 fs bandwidth- and diffraction-limited pulses to produce wavelength/30-scale
signals of ~200 fs duration, with intensity enhancement on the order of 5.
Lowering material absorption can further enhance the peak intensity. The
results presented can be used to assess the perspectives of ultrafast
sub-diffraction light manipulation in other portions of the electromagnetic
spectrum by adjusting the (meta)material composition of the funnels.

Abstract: Flying focus techniques produce laser pulses whose focal points travel at
arbitrary, controllable velocities. While this flexibility can enhance a broad
range of laser-based applications, existing techniques constrain the motion of
the focal point to the propagation direction of the pulse. Here, we introduce a
flying focus configuration that decouples the motion of the focus from the
propagation direction. A chirped laser pulse focused and diffracted by a
diffractive lens and grating creates a focal point that can move both along and
transverse to the propagation direction. The focal length of the lens, grating
period, and chirp can be tuned to control the direction and velocity of the
focus. Simulations demonstrate this control for a holographic configuration
suited to high-power pulses, in which two off-axis pump beams with different
focal lengths encode the equivalent phase of a chromatic lens and grating in a
gas or plasma. For low-power pulses, conventional solid-state or adaptive
optics can be used instead. Multi-dimensional control over the focal trajectory
enables new configurations for applications, including laser wakefield
acceleration of ions, steering of broadband THz radiation, and surface harmonic
generation.

Abstract: Microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature, and microbial activities are closely
intertwined with the entire life cycle system and human life. Developing novel
technologies for the detection, characterization and manipulation of
microorganisms promotes their applications in clinical, environmental and
industrial areas. Over the last two decades, terahertz (THz) technology has
emerged as a new optical tool for microbiology. The great potential originates
from the unique advantages of THz waves including the high sensitivity to water
and inter-/intra-molecular motions, the non-invasive and label-free detecting
scheme, and their low photon energy. THz waves have been utilized as a stimulus
to alter microbial functions, or as a sensing approach for quantitative
measurement and qualitative differentiation. This review specifically focuses
on recent research progress of THz technology applied in the field of
microbiology, including two major parts of THz biological effects and the
microbial detection applications. In the end of this paper, we summarize the
research progress and discuss the challenges currently faced by THz technology
in microbiology, along with potential solutions. We also provide a perspective
on future development directions. This review aims to build a bridge between
THz photonics and microbiology, promoting both fundamental research and
application development in this interdisciplinary field.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: All-perovskite tandem solar cells with narrow and wide bandgap perovskite
absorbers are promising candidates for low-cost and high efficiency
photovoltaic applications. However, the open circuit voltage of typical tandem
structures is generally smaller than the sum of the individual voltages in the
single-junction form; a quantity we call the voltage gap. Subcell optimization
can only begin once nonradiative losses associated with each absorber layer can
be properly identified. To address this, we used absolute electroluminescence
hyperspectral imaging to construct external radiative efficiency maps of each
subcell within the tandem stack and compare these measurements with single
junction devices. These measurements were then combined with additional
electro-optical characterization and modeling to construct subcell current vs
voltage curves. We find that the narrow band gap subcell contributes the most
towards the voltage gap and therefore fabrication and processing efforts should
focus on reducing nonradiative recombination losses within the narrow band gap
absorber.

Abstract: Artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs) mimic the idealized boundary condition
of a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), which reflects electromagnetic waves
with a preserved electric field and inverted magnetic field. Despite their
usefulness, existing AMC implementations often rely on complex or impractical
designs, and lack a clear electromagnetic theory explaining their behavior,
especially under oblique or polarization-diverse incidence. This work addresses
these limitations by presenting a rigorous electromagnetic framework for PMC
metasurfaces based on dipolar and quadrupolar surface susceptibilities within
the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) formalism. We show that
achieving polarization- and angle-independent PMC behavior requires a specific
set of heteroanisotropic (nonlocal) susceptibilities, and we derive closed-form
expressions for angular scattering that include higher-order multipole
contributions. A physically realizable, asymmetric metasurface structure is
then designed to satisfy these theoretical conditions. Despite its geometric
asymmetry, the proposed structure exhibits a isotropic PMC response at
resonance, confirmed by full-wave simulations and multipolar susceptibility
extraction. These results demonstrate how properly engineered surface
multipoles can yield angularly independent magnetic boundary conditions using
only thin, passive metallic layers. This work bridges the gap between AMC
design and electromagnetic theory, and enables a new class of angle-independent
metasurface reflectors for more accurate simulations, optimizations and
innovative AMC designs.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the spiking dynamics of biological
neurons for brain-inspired computation. While electronic implementations of
artificial spiking neurons have dominated to date, photonic approaches are
attracting increasing research interest as they promise ultrafast,
energy-efficient operation with low-crosstalk and high bandwidth. Nevertheless,
existing photonic neurons largely mimic integrate-and-fire models, but
neuroscience shows that neurons also encode information through richer
mechanisms, such as the frequency and temporal patterns of spikes. Here, we
present a photonic-electronic resonate-and-fire (R-and-F) spiking neuron that
responds to the temporal structure of high-speed optical inputs. This is based
on a light-sensitive resonant tunnelling diode that produces excitable spikes
in response to nanosecond, low-power (100 microwatt) optical signals at
infrared telecom wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate control of R-and-F
dynamics through inter-pulse timing of the optical stimuli and applied bias
voltage, achieving bandpass filtering of both analogue and digital inputs. The
R-and-F neuron also supports optical fan-in via wavelength-division multiplexed
inputs from four vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). This
electronic-photonic neuron exhibits key functionalities - including
spike-frequency filtering, temporal pattern recognition, and digital-to-spiking
conversion - critical for neuromorphic optical processing. Our approach
establishes a pathway toward low-power, high-speed temporal information
processing for light-enabled neuromorphic computing.

Result: The approach reduces complexity from quadratic to log-linear, achieves robust reconstruction at an oversampling ratio of 2.8, and can be implemented with basic optical elements.

Conclusion: This work marks a significant advancement in phase retrieval, offering a practical and scalable solution with rigorous theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Phase retrieval is a nonlinear inverse problem that arises in a wide range of
imaging modalities, from electron microscopy to optical Fourier ptychography.
Among various modalities, random phase retrieval stands out thanks to its
strong theoretical guarantees and efficient reconstruction algorithms, although
its applicability is hindered by prohibitive computational costs. In this
paper, we propose the structured random models for phase retrieval, where we
emulate a dense random matrix by a cascade of structured transforms and random
diagonal matrices. We demonstrate that structured random models can achieve the
same reconstruction performance as dense random models, with complexity reduced
from quadratic to log-linear. Using a spectral method initialization followed
by gradient descent, robust reconstruction is obtained at an oversampling ratio
as low as 2.8. Moreover, we observe that the reconstruction performance is
solely determined by the singular value distribution of the forward matrix.
This class of models can directly be implemented with basic optical elements
such as lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with
robust reconstruction guarantees.

Abstract: The integrated devices that generate structural optical fields with
non-trivial orbital angular momentums (OAMs) hold great potential for advanced
optical applications, but are restricted to complex nanostructures and static
functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable OAM beam generator from
a simple microring resonator without requiring grating-like nanostructures. Our
approach harnesses Brillouin interaction between confined phonon and optical
modes, where the acoustic field is excited through microwave input. The phonon
stimulate the conversion from a guided optical mode into a free-space vortex
beam. Under the selection rule of radiation, the OAM order of the emitted light
is determined by the acousto-optic phase matching and is rapidly reconfigurable
by simply tuning the microwave frequency. Furthermore, this all-microwave
control scheme allows for the synthesis of arbitrary high-dimensional OAM
superposition states by programming the amplitudes and phases of the driving
fields. Analytical and numerical models predict a radiation efficiency over
25\% for experimentally feasible on-chip microcavities. This work introduces a
novel paradigm for chip-to-free-space interfaces, replacing fixed nanophotonic
structures with programmable acousto-optic interactions for versatile
structured light generation.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the growing demand for dispersion engineering in integrated optical circuits through innovative use of Bragg mirrors and resonators.

Result: The proposed method successfully demonstrates agreement between simulations and experimental results, showcasing the feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: This work provides an efficient and general solution for dispersion engineering in integrated optical circuits using distributed Bragg mirrors and resonators with high core-to-cladding index contrast in III-V semiconductors.

Abstract: Technological advances in the fabrication of nanophotonic circuits have
driven the scientific community to increasingly focus on the precise tailoring
of their key optical properties, over a broadband spectral domain. In this
context, the modulation of the local refractive index can be exploited to
customize an effective reflectivity by the use of distributed Bragg mirrors,
enabling the on-chip integration of Fabry-P\'erot resonators. The resulting
cavity length is strongly wavelength-dependent, offering practical solutions to
the growing demand of dispersion engineering. Owing to their typically high
core-to-cladding refractive index contrast and exceptional nonlinear
properties, III-V semiconductor-based platforms represent promising candidates
for the fabrication of Bragg reflectors. In this work, we propose an
AlGaAs-on-insulator linear resonator based on distributed Bragg mirrors. We
discuss the first experimental demonstration of a systematic, shape-constrained
inverse design technique which tailors a prescribed dispersion profile, showing
a strong agreement between simulations and measurements. In perspective, the
proposed approach offers an efficient and general response to the challenge of
dispersion engineering in integrated optical circuits.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Non-diffracting beams have potential to mitigate blockage in mmWave systems, but their performance advantage over conventional beams is conditional in near-field communication, influenced by obstacles. A systematic analysis quantifies these advantages and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the conditions under which ND beams outperform conventional beams is crucial for optimizing blockage mitigation in mmWave systems, particularly in near-field communication where obstacles are more prevalent.

Method: A unified holographic generator was developed to generate various structured beams under the constraints of a planar phased array. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to compare ND beams with a baseline pencil beam.

Result: ND beams show a power advantage in specific regions but have variable performance, with a 60-70% probability of outperforming the baseline in their optimal range. The advantage is highly sensitive to obstacle geometry, particularly against large blockers.

Conclusion: ND beams offer significant potential for blockage mitigation in mmWave systems, but their application requires careful consideration of their geometry-dependent limitations for effective near-field link optimization.

Abstract: Non diffracting (ND) beams are often cited as a promising solution to
mitigate blockage in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. However, a quantitative
answer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams
actually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially
in the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the
first systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND
beams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic
generator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu)
under the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair
comparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture.
Through extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage
regime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible
link-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a
powerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive
average gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of
outperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is
strongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness
against large blockers. These findings provide not just a practical roadmap for
judiciously employing ND beams but also a clear motivation for future work in
environment-aware, adaptively shaped structured beams.

Motivation: The paper's motivation centers around creating tunable optical devices by precisely controlling plasmonic resonances, which is a key challenge in this field.

Method: The scientists developed a MDM nanodisk array and systematically studied the bidirectional tuning of resonance wavelengths using near-infrared (NIR) observation.

Result: The key result is the observation of a blueshift response of 457.82 nm for a 5-10 nm thickness variation, the highest blueshift reported to date.

Conclusion: The study opens a new avenue for designing tunable optical devices.

Abstract: Precise control of plasmonic resonances across a broad spectral range is
central to the development of tunable optical devices. Yet, achieving both
redshifts and blueshifts within a single nanostructure has remained elusive.
Here we introduce a metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) nanodisk array that enables
bidirectional tuning of resonance wavelengths throughout the near-infrared
(NIR) region. The observed spectral evolution follows the plasmon ruler
relationship, with unprecedented tuning properties. In particular, we report a
record blueshift response of 457.82 nm for a small nanodisk thickness variation
of only 5-10 nm, the highest blueshift response demonstrated in plasmonic
architectures to date. This platform offers finely tunable resonances spanning
an exceptionally wide NIR range, providing new insights into electromagnetic
(EM) coupling mechanisms and establishing a foundation for next-generation
tunable devices in sensing, optical communications, and dynamic displays.

Abstract: We study $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres generated by helium focused ion beam
(FIB) irradiation in thin ($\sim$70 nm) hBN nanoflakes, in order to investigate
the effect of implantation conditions on the key parameters that influence the
magnetic field sensitivity of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ quantum sensors. Using a
combination of photoluminescence, optically detected magnetic resonance, and
Raman spectroscopy, we examine the competing factors of maximising signal
intensity through larger $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ concentration against the
degradation in spin coherence and lattice quality observed at high ion
fluences. Our results indicate that both the $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin properties
and hBN lattice parameters are largely preserved up to an ion fluence of
$10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$, and beyond this significant degradation occurs in both.
At the optimal implantation dose, an AC magnetic sensitivity of $\sim
1\,\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ is achieved. Using the patterned
implantation enabled by the FIB, we find that $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres and
the associated lattice damage are well localised to the implanted regions. This
work demonstrates how careful selection of fabrication parameters can be used
to optimise the properties of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres in hBN, supporting
their application as quantum sensors based on 2D materials.

Abstract: To address the issue of beam collapse resulting from instantaneous
instability during switch transitions in beam tracking, this paper proposes a
novel beam switching method based on a row-by-row switching code table. The
paper first establishes an abstract model of the beam tracking application
scenario and introduces the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) employed
in this paper. Subsequently, simulations are conducted to compare the
conventional direct beam switching method with the proposed row-by-row
switching code table approach, thereby elucidating the advantages and
limitations of the new method. In parallel, a RIS hardware platform is
constructed in a microwave anechoic chamber for experimental validation. Both
simulation and experimental results show that, by incorporating intermediate
state transitions, the approach achieves beam tracking without beam collapse
while incurring no significant gain loss. Finally, the paper discusses the
applicability scope and potential scenarios for the proposed method. This
research provides valuable insights for applications in mobile communications
and radar detection.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效精准的短期和中期地热潜热泵系统仿真方法，可扩展应用于更长期限的仿真，助力更精确的系统设计。

Abstract: An accurate design of a ground-coupled heat pump system requires the
knowledge of the outlet fluid temperature from the borehole heat exchangers
(BHEs), both in the short and long term. This paper fucuses on the short and
medium term. In this time range, either 3D finite-element simulations or
Thermal Resistance Capacity Models (TRCMs) can be applied. The former can yield
very accurate results but require long computation times. The latter are much
faster but cannot be fully precise, because they require simplifying
assumptions. In this paper, we present a new method for the short-term and
medium-term simulation of single U-tube BHEs, which combines the speed of TRCMs
and the accuracy of finite-elements simulations. The method uses a TRCM to
estimate the thermal response of the BHE, then corrects the results by
interpolation with a dataset, which has been produced by running 54
finite-element simulations in various configurations. The model is implemented
in a C++ program, available at the open-source online data repository of the
University of Bologna. The program provides, within two seconds, the time
evolution of the inlet, outlet and mean fluid temperature, of the mean BHE
surface temperature, of the 3D and the effective borehole thermal resistance.
It can be easily connected to long-term simulation tools to obtain the
full-time-scale thermal response of a bore field.

Conclusion: Bi-metal systems could be useful for applications in sensing and advanced electronic devices.

Abstract: Nanoporous metals are extensively investigated as platforms for applications
in plasmonics. They present high surface areas and strong local electric fields
that can be tuned at different energies, playing with the choice of the metals
and the morphology of the porous layers. Until recently, research in the field
of plasmonics has primarily focused on porous metals composed of a single
element, with limited attention given to the impact of alloy composition. The
investigation of bi-metallic systems has only just begun to emerge in the
literature. In particular, combining two or more different plasmonic metals, it
could be possible to explore the interactions between two metals excited at
specific energies. This involves plasmonic coupling, electron transfer, band
hybridization at the interface, electromagnetic field interactions, and
possibly thermal and electronic energy transfer depending on separation, size,
and materials involved. The analysis of bi-metal systems can also be
interesting in biomolecule detection, such as in the case of Surface Enhanced
Raman Scattering (SERS). Here we report, for the first time, a detailed study

Abstract: Electro-momentum coupling in piezoelectric metamaterials with broken
inversion symmetry enables asymmetric elastic wave transport by linking
macroscopic electric fields to momentum, an effect analogous to Willis coupling
in elastic media. A one-dimensional layered piezoelectric metamaterial
integrated with shunt circuits, consisting of a resistor, inductor, and
strain-proportional voltage feedback gain, is proposed to achieve dynamic
control of frequency-dependent stiffness and damping through electromechanical
interactions. Tuning the circuit parameters yields direction-dependent wave
scattering at targeted frequencies. Dynamic homogenization reveals macroscopic
constitutive relations exhibiting both Willis and electro-momentum couplings.
Non-Hermitian exceptional points are identified, where scattering eigenmodes
coalesce and produce extreme asymmetries in wave response. Near these points,
the system realizes unidirectional zero reflection (UZR) and unidirectional
perfect absorption (UPA), achieving complete absorption from one direction and
total reflection from the opposite side. The findings demonstrate a compact and
reconfigurable platform for tunable, directional elastic wave control using
passive-active hybrid metamaterials, opening new avenues for programmable
devices in acoustic isolation, wave-based computing, sensing, and energy
manipulation in solid media.

Result: Effective counter-rotation can significantly enhance interferometer contrast, achieving over 90% even in challenging environments.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential for high-performance inertial measurements in space despite the challenges posed by rotations.

Abstract: Rotations play a detrimental role in achieving ultra-high-performance
inertial measurements with an atom interferometer, leading potentially to a
total loss of interference contrast and the emergence of dominant phase shift
biases. This becomes particularly significant when considering operation in
dynamic conditions such as those encountered in Earth orbiting satellites in
the perspective of future space gravity missions on-boarding a cold atom
accelerometer. We study in this context the impact of rotation on the phase
shift and contrast of an atom interferometer and investigate mitigation
strategies. An analytical model is derived and compared to experimental
demonstrations carried out using an original setup in which the well-controlled
proof-mass of a space electrostatic accelerometer is used as the
retro-reflection mirror of a cold atom gravimeter. By properly counter-rotating
the electrostatic proof-mass, we demonstrate for instance the possibility of
recovering the interferometer contrast, otherwise equal to zero, to a level
better than 90%, in both cases of constant angular velocities or in presence of
angular accelerations. Our results demonstrate the possibility to perform high
performance inertial measurements with a cold atom interferometer in a
challenging environments.

Abstract: Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum
gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and
do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues
of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of
topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we
extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are
discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to
$\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory,
our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional
gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare
states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric
variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.

Conclusion: 结果表明，rQFC在二维模型中成立并在特定CFT中得到验证，同时在d>2时提供新的约束条件。这些发现为检验rQFC提供了新的框架，有助于推动量子引力理论的澄清。

Abstract: The restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC) plays a central role in an
axiomatic formulation of semiclassical gravity. Since much hinges on its
validity, it is imperative to subject the rQFC to rigorous tests in novel
settings. Here we do so in two independent directions. First, we prove rQFC in
a class of spacetime dimension $d=2$ toy models, JT gravity coupled to a QFT.
We also construct explicit counter-examples to the original and stronger
Quantum Focusing Conjecture in a regime where matter quantum effects are
comparable to the total dilaton value. Second, for $d>2$, we derive a new CFT
constraint: the coincident limit of the product of two averaged null energy
operators in any CFT cannot be zero. Equivalently, the rQFC imposes an upper
bound of $2d-1$ on the scaling dimension of the leading even-spin Regge
trajectory, analytically continued in $J$ and evaluated at $J=3$. The bound
holds in free and weakly-interacting CFTs, and is saturated by the double-trace
trajectories in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills at strong coupling. We
speculate about a strengthened Quantum Null Energy Condition that would imply
our results.

Logarithmic behavior associated with disorder often appears in such contexts and is ubiquitous in theoretical physics.

Result: The paper presents a general framework for logarithmic conformal defects and their properties, including correlation functions, operator expansions, and conformal blocks. A concrete example is analyzed in the free scalar theory with generalized pinning defects, showing a half-line of fixed points describing logarithmic conformal defects. Additionally, the authors propose a monotone governing defect renormalization group flow for subdimensional disorder.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for logarithmic conformal defects, linking them to known phenomena in disordered systems. It lays the groundwork for further exploration of defects in various contexts and offers new tools for understanding the interplay between disorder and conformal symmetry. The identification of fixed points and the proposed renormalization group flow opens new avenues for studying critical phenomena and phase transitions in disordered systems.

Abstract: We study quenched disorder localized on a $p$-dimensional subspacetime in a
$d$-dimensional conformal field theory. Motivated by the logarithmic behavior
often associated with disorder, we introduce a defect setup in which bulk local
operators transform in ordinary conformal representations, while defect local
operators assemble into logarithmic multiplets. We refer to such objects as
logarithmic defects and investigate their model-independent properties dictated
solely by conformal symmetry and its representation theory, including
correlation functions, logarithmic defect operator expansions, and conformal
blocks. As a concrete example, we analyze the free scalar theory with a
generalized pinning defect subject to random coupling fluctuations, and we
identify a half-line of fixed points describing the corresponding logarithmic
conformal defects. Along the way, we propose a candidate monotone governing
defect renormalization group flows induced by subdimensional disorder. We
comment on various generalizations and the broader program of bootstrapping

(k=-1) Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) non-static spacetimes cannot be
simultaneously nonsingular, geodesically complete, and consistent with the
averaged null energy condition (ANEC). Equivalently, any dynamic flat or open
universe that is complete must violate the ANEC. By contrast, closed universes
(k=+1) uniquely admit nonsingular, geodesically complete, ANEC-consistent
solutions, with global de Sitter space as the canonical realization that
saturates the ANEC. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that positive
spatial curvature naturally mimics the phenomenology of phantom dark energy
(w<-1), biasing flat-model reconstructions of w(z) at the 1% level. These
results sharpen the classical singularity theorems, establish a new
classification of eternal cosmologies, and motivate renewed scrutiny of spatial
curvature in both theory and observation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机主要来自量子引力和复杂性理论领域。
理论框架的构建是最关键的问题之一。
在双标量SYK模型和德西特空间方面已有部分研究成果，将其联系起来有助于更深入地理解复杂性。
此外，现有的复杂性方案针对视界或时钟观察者，而这些方案在宇宙学时空中的应用尚不明确。因此，提出一种新的复杂性构想是具有价值的。

Abstract: We utilize the recent connection between the high energy limit of the
double-scaled SYK model and two-dimensional de Sitter solutions of sine dilaton
gravity to identify the length of a family of geodesics spanned between future
and past infinities with Krylov spread complexity. This constitutes an explicit
top-down microscopic realization of holographic complexity in a cosmological
spacetime. Our identification is different from the existing holographic
complexity proposals for de Sitter geometries which are anchored either on
horizons as holographic screens or on timelike observers. This leads us to
introduce and investigate a new cosmological holographic complexity proposal in
any dimension. It is based on extremal timelike volumes anchored at the
asymptotic past and future and at large values of the anchoring boundary
coordinate grows linearly with growth rate proportional to the product of de
Sitter entropy and temperature.

### [87] [Shadow sectors of gauge theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14079)
*Loris Del Grosso,David E. Kaplan,Francesco Serra*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses configurations in gauge theories where fields behave like they're under static charges, termed 'shadow charges.' Non-abelian theories initially seem to need additional physical fields with static charges, but gauge theory alone provides a consistent description. Canonical quantization results in continuous shadow charges for abelian theories and quantized charges for non-abelian theories. The findings suggest that all local conservation laws lead to gauge symmetries, even with second-class constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper appears to delve into the behavior of gauge theories, specifically exploring configurations where fields mimic static charges. It contrasts expectations for abelian and non-abelian theories and provides insights into the quantization of shadow charges.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis, likely involving detailed mathematical derivations, to investigate configurations in both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories. It also uses canonical quantization to explore the implications for shadow charges.

Result: The main results are that non-abelian theories require additional physical fields with static charges, but gauge theory alone consistently describes shadow charges. Canonical quantization leads to continuous shadow charges for abelian theories and quantized charges for non-abelian theories. The findings emphasize that all local conservation laws give rise to gauge symmetries, even in the presence of second-class constraints.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the behavior of radiation (shadow charges) is tied to gauge symmetry in both abelian and non-abelian theories, with implications for quantization depending on the type of gauge theory. It also reaffirms the importance of second-class constraints in maintaining consistency in gauge theories.

Abstract: We show that both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories admit configurations
in which the fields behave as if in the presence of static charge densities, or
``shadow charges". These correspond to nontrivial initial conditions for the
fields that generate gauge transformations, the Gauss' law operators. In
non-abelian theories, such configurations seem to demand additional physical
fields with exactly static charge densities. In contrast with this expectation,
we show that gauge theory alone provides a consistent and gauge-invariant
description of shadow charges. Canonical quantization then yields continuous
shadow charges for abelian theories and quantized ones for non-abelian
theories. In general, our findings indicate that all local conservation laws
give rise to gauge symmetries, even in the presence of second-class
constraints.

Conclusion: 该研究成果为费曼积分的解析研究提供了新的工具，有利于更深入理解多粒子过程的量子特性。

Abstract: We develop a geometric framework in Feynman-parameter space to determine
constraints on the sequential discontinuities of Feynman integrals. Our method
is based on tracking the deformation of the integration contour as external
kinematics are analytically continued. This procedure imposes powerful
constraints on the analytic structure of Feynman integrals, providing crucial
inputs for their bootstrap. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by
applying it to integrals in dimensional regularization, with higher propagator
powers, and to examples with non-uniform transcendental weight. The method is
illustrated with several one- and two-loop calculations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We continue studying regularization scheme dependence of the $\mathcal{N}=2$
supersymmetric sigma models. In the present work the previous result for the
four loop $\beta$-function is extended to the five loop order. Namely, we find
the renormalization scheme, in which the fifth loop contribution is completely
eliminated, while the fourth loop contribution is represented by the certain
invariant, which is coordinate independent for the metrics of some models.
These models include complete $T$-duals of the $\eta$-deformed $SU(n)/U(n-1)$
models, as well as $\eta$- and $\lambda$-deformed $SU(2)/U(1)$ models, whose
metrics solve the RG flow equation up to the fifth loop order. We also comment
on the $\lambda$-deformed $SU(2)/U(1)$ and $SU(3)/U(2)$ case, showing that they
satisfy five-loop RG flow equation, and discuss their K\"ahler structure.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解纯SU(N) 阳极理论中时扭Wilson环的行为提供了重要的理论支持。

Abstract: It has been known for many years that, in Yang-Mills theories with
$\mathcal{N}=4,2,2^*$ supersymmetry, certain nontrivial supersymmetric Wilson
loops exist with v.e.v. either trivial or computable by localization that
arises from a cohomological field theory, which also computes the
nonperturbative prepotential in $\mathcal{N}=2,2^*$ theories. Moreover, some
years ago it has been argued that, in analogy with the supersymmetric case,
certain nontrivial twistor Wilson loops with trivial v.e.v. to the leading
large-$N$ order exist in pure SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and are computed, to
the leading large-$N$ order, by a topological field/string theory that, to the
next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order, conjecturally captures nonperturbative
information on the glueball spectrum and glueball one-loop effective action as
well. In fact, independently of the above, it has also been claimed that "every
gauge theory with a mass gap should contain a possibly trivial topological
field theory in the infrared", so that the aforementioned twistor Wilson loops
realize a stronger version of this idea, as they have trivial v.e.v. at all
energy scales and not only in the infrared. In the present paper, we provide a
detailed proof of the triviality of the v.e.v. of twistor Wilson loops at the
leading large-$N$ order in Yang-Mills theory that has previously been only
sketched, opening the way to further developments.

*D. Dalmazi,B. dos S. Martins,E. L. Mendonça,R. Schimidt Bittencourt*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a modified version of the Skvortsov-Vasiliev model for massless integer-spin particles, showing that it only propagates specific helicity modes and confirms unitarity through two-point amplitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors likely aimed to explore alternative formulations of higher-spin theories, seeking simplicity or novel insights into their behavior under certain gauges.

Method: Utilizing the light-cone gauge, the authors derive two-point amplitudes for various spins (s=3 and s=4) and demonstrate unitarity in a Lorentz-invariant framework. They also conduct a similar analysis for the Fronsdal model.

Result: The modified SV model propagates only specified helicities and maintains unitarity, with results consistent for both s=3 and s=4. Comparing this to the Fronsdal model shows that while both share the same particle content, the amplitudes differ by contact terms, suggesting potential inequivalence of their interacting terms.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a simplified version of the SV model for higher spins, validated through Lorentz-invariant unitarity checks, while highlighting differences from the Fronsdal model.

Abstract: Here we suggest a partially broken version of the Skvortsov-Vasiliev (SV)
model for massless particles of arbitrary integer spin $s\ge 3$. The traceless
gauge parameter of the Weyl transformation is now required to be transverse. In
the light-cone gauge we offer a simple proof that the model contains only
spin-$s$ helicities as propagating modes. In the $s=3$ and $s=4$ cases we are
able to calculate the two point amplitude and confirm unitarity in a explicitly
Lorentz invariant way.
  For the recently suggested partially broken Fronsdal model, for $s=3$ and
$s=4$, unitarity is also confirmed in a Lorentz invariant way from their two
point amplitudes. In both Fronsdal and SV partially broken models the two point
amplitudes differ from their unbroken counterparts by contact terms which
guarantees the same particle content but indicates potential non-equivalence of
possible interacting terms.

Conclusion: 研究为理解随机规范场中的电荷对产生提供了强有力的工具，尤其是在天体物理和早期宇宙研究中。

Abstract: We formulate a stochastic generalisation of the Schwinger effect, extending
pair production to statistically fluctuating gauge-field backgrounds. Our
approach captures realistic field configurations that are transient,
inhomogeneous, and stochastic, as commonly encountered in cosmological and
high-energy astrophysical settings. Using the effective action formalism, we
compute the vacuum decay rate and number density of charged particles,
obtaining closed-form analytical expressions for both scalar and fermionic
cases. To isolate the essential physics, the analysis is performed in flat
spacetime and at zero temperature, providing a controlled setting in which
curvature and thermal effects can be neglected. As a proof of concept, we
present representative phenomenological examples relevant to astrophysical
plasmas and early-Universe-motivated scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究将Dorfmeister等人的工具引入几何场论，成功构造了tt*-结构，并揭示了外积结构与Grassmannian量子同调的关系，为更复杂的结构研究提供了方法。

Abstract: The tt*-equation (topological-anti-topological fusion equation) was
introduced by S. Cecotti and C. Vafa for describing massive deformation of
supersymmetric conformal field theories. B. Dubrovin formulated the
tt*-equation as a flat bundle, called tt*-structure. In this paper, we
construct a tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian of
complex \(k\)-plane and obtain global solutions to the tt*-equation, following
the idea of Bourdeau. We give a precise mathematical formulation and a
description of the solutions by using p.d.e. theory and the harmonic map theory
developed by J. Dorfmeister, F. Pedit and H. Wu (the DPW method). Furthermore,
we give an isomorphism between tt*-structure for the \(k\)-th exterior product
of tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the complex projective space and
the tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian.

Conclusion: 该方法有效克服了基于弦构型的限制，为3d镜像对偶提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges
possess a unique duality known as 3d mirror symmetry. Under this
correspondence, the Coulomb branch of one theory is equivalent to the Higgs
branch of its mirror dual, and vice versa. Over the past decades, extensive
effort has been devoted to charting the landscape of 3d mirror pairs, though
progress has often been constrained by the need to identify suitable brane
configurations. In this first instalment, we introduce a new quiver-based
algorithm, termed Growth and Fusion, which completes a quartet of Higgsing
algorithms alongside Decay and Fission, Quiver Subtraction, and Quiver
Addition. Together, these four algorithms provide a systematic framework that
circumvents the limitations of brane constructions, enabling us to determine
the mirror dual of a given quiver and to systematically bootstrap new 3d mirror
pairs. We demonstrate the power of this approach on a new class of circular 3d
mirror pairs.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了超对称Wess-Zumino模型存在的内在矛盾，为超对称理论的应用指明了方向。

Abstract: We prove the internal inconsistency of the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model.
Our proof is based on three assumptions. The first assumption is that in the
full theory the structure of counter temcs coincides with the structure of the
counter terms in the perturbation theory. The second assumption is the
positivity of norm states - no ghosts in the spectrum of the model. The third
assumption is that the canonical commutation relations among generalized
coordinates and momenta are valid in renormalized theory. The obtained results
mean that there are negative norm states in the spectrum of the WZ model.

Abstract: We show that the 't Hooft anomaly of a quantum field theory with continuous
flavor symmetry can be detected from rearrangements of the topological defect
webs implementing the global symmetry in general spacetime dimension, which is
concretized in 2D by the F-moves of the defect lines. Via dualizing the defects
to flat background gauge field configurations, we characterize the 't Hooft
anomaly by various cohomological data of the symmetry group, where the
cohomology of Lie groups with discrete topology plays the central role. We find
that an extra dimension emerges naturally as a consequence of the mathematical
description of the 't Hooft anomaly in the case of flat gauging.

Abstract: We investigate Krylov state complexity as a probe of the quantum Mpemba
effect in quantum spin chains. For models without global $U(1)$ symmetry,
Krylov complexity exhibits clear Mpemba-like crossings, consistent with
conventional diagnostics such as the trace distance, while offering a
complementary interpretation in terms of Hilbert-space exploration and
dynamical delocalization. In $U(1)$-symmetric systems, we confirm that the
recently proposed symmetric component of Krylov complexity serves as a robust
and reliable indicator of the QME, capturing anomalous relaxation even in cases
where the total complexity fails to do so.

Motivation: Bilinear forms and Casoratian solutions are essential for understanding discrete integrable systems like lattice GD-4 equations. Cubic consistency is a key property ensuring the equations' integrability and compatibility.

Result: Novel bilinear forms and Casoratian solutions for δ-extended equations have been derived, maintaining cubic integrability.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of discrete integrable systems and provides tools for their analysis.

Abstract: In this paper we derive bilinear forms and solutions in Casoratians for some

equations were recently formulated from the direct linearization approach and
exhibit multidimensionally consistent property in multi-component form. The
obtained solitons and Casoratian forms enable us to extend these equations by

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue waves (RWs)
emerging from the modulation instability (MI) of plane waves for the DNLS
equation. The \(n\)-th moments and ensemble-averaged kinetic and potential
energy exhibit oscillatory convergence towards their steady-state values.
Specifically, the amplitudes of oscillations for these indexes decay
asymptotically with time as \(t^{-1.36}\), while the phase shifts demonstrate a
nonlinear decay with a rate of \(t^{-0.78}\). The frequency of these
oscillations is observed to be twice the maximum growth rate of MI. These
oscillations can be classified into two distinct types: one is in phase with
ensemble-averaged potential energy modulus $|\langle H_4\rangle|$, and the
other is anti-phase. At the same time, this unity is also reflected in the
wave-action spectrum \( S_k(t) \) for a given \( k \), the auto-correlation
function \( g(x,t) \) for a given \( x \), as well as the PDF \( P(I,t) \). The
critical feature of the turbulence is the wave-action spectrum, which follows a
power-law distribution of \( |k+3|^{-\alpha} \) expect for $k=-3$. Unlike the
NLS equation, the turbulence in the DNLS setting is asymmetric, primarily due
to the asymmetry between the wave number of the plane wave from the MI and the
perturbation wave number.. As the asymptotic peak value of \( S_k \) is
observed at \( k = -3 \), the auto-correlation function exhibits a nonzero
level as \( x \to \pm L/2 \). The PDF of the wave intensity asymptotically
approaches the exponential distribution in an oscillatory manner. However,
during the initial stage of the nonlinear phase, MI slightly increases the
occurrence of RWs. This happens at the moments when the potential modulus is at
its minimum, where the probability of RWs occurring in the range of \( I\in
[12, 15] \) is significantly higher than in the asymptotic steady state.

### [103] [Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14886)
*Jerónimo Duarte,Ignacio García-Mata,Diego A. Wisniacki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the long-time behavior of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) in the kicked Ising spin chain, revealing its exponential decay rate in both integrable and chaotic regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum systems, particularly quantum chaos and information scrambling, is crucial for advancing quantum physics and its applications.

Method: The authors analyze the kicked Ising spin chain using numerical simulations and analytical methods, focusing on the Liouvillian spectrum to study the decay of the OTOC.

Result: In isolated systems, the OTOC decays exponentially with a rate equal to twice the intrinsic Liouvillian gap, regardless of whether the system is integrable or chaotic.

Conclusion: This work establishes a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems, bridging quantum chaos with the Liouvillian spectrum.

Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in
quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body
systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by
Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical
limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the
Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the
slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study
the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of
the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic
gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between
integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a
unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed
many-body quantum systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解量子系统在相变中的动力学行为和复杂性演变很重要。

Method: 使用了微分比 Nickerson 展开，将演化过程映射到一个一维的跃迁模型，并通过准确分析论证了复杂性累积量与缺陷密度的标度关系，且分布趋于高斯分布。

Result: 所有累积量的标度指数与缺陷密度相同，且分布趋于高斯，适用于任意二阶量子相变。

Conclusion: 这些结果提供了复杂性增长在二阶量子相变中的普适性论证。

Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the spread complexity in the Krylov
space of quantum systems driven across a quantum phase transition. Using the
diabatic Magnus expansion, we map the evolution to an effective one-dimensional
hopping model. For the transverse field Ising model, we establish an exact link
between the growth of complexity and the Kibble-Zurek defect scaling: all
cumulants of complexity exhibit the same power-law scaling as the defect
density, with coefficients identical to the mean, and the full distribution
asymptotically becomes Gaussian. These results yield general scaling arguments
for the growth of complexity across arbitrary second-order quantum phase
transitions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate how non-stabilizer resources enable the emergence of quantum
state designs within the projected ensemble. Starting from initial states with
finite magic and applying resource-free Clifford circuits to scramble them, we
analyze the ensemble generated by performing projective Pauli measurements on a
subsystem of the final state. Using both analytical arguments and large-scale
numerics, we show that the projected ensemble converges towards a state
$k$-design with an error that decays exponentially with the $k$-th Stabilizer
Renyi Entropy of the pre-measurement state, via a Magic-Induced Design Ansatz
(MIDA) that we introduce. We identify a universal scaling form, valid across
different classes of magic initial states, and corroborate it through numerical
simulations and analytical calculations of the frame potential. For
finite-depth Clifford unitaries, we show that the timescales at which state
designs emerge are controlled by the transport of magic. We identify a ``magic
teleportation'' mechanism whereby non-Clifford resources injected locally
spread through Clifford scrambling and measurements across distances beyond the
lightcone. Our results demonstrate how a small and controlled amount of magic
suffices to generate highly random states, providing a systematic route toward
generating quantum state designs in early fault-tolerant devices.

Conclusion: 时空纠缠转换是新Floquet量子现象，具有持久性吸引力和像”。

Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena
without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we
discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ in a Floquet spin chain, which
correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement
Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We
show that these transitions are entanglement-driven, i.e., they require
initially entangled states and remain invisible to conventional local
observables. Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of
driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently
of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum
reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement
echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips. At high frequencies, the entanglement
Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period,
rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling
reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$,
matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely
dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes
temporal entanglement transitions as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the estimation sensitivity of gravitational acceleration using
squeezed probe states within a quantum metrology framework. In particular, we
analyze how the squeezing phase, beyond its amplitudes, of the probes affects
the attainable precision. We find that probes squeezed along the canonical
phase-space quadrature can fail to achieve a quantum Fisher information (QFI)
surpassing the shot-noise limit, regardless of the interaction time with the
gravitational field. In contrast, position-momentum correlated input states
with the squeezing amplitude can overcome this limit. Furthermore, we show that
optimal sensitivity is attained through projective momentum measurements
combined with a time-dependent adjustment of the squeezing phase. Our results
are important to highlight the fundamental role of phase-engineered squeezing
in experimental gravimetry protocols.

### [108] [Sequential Quantum Measurements and the Instrumental Group Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13980)
*Christopher S. Jackson*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores continuous measurement in quantum mechanics, introducing the instrumental group algebra (IGA) and ultraoperators, and their relation to the KDO and Lindblad master equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper fills a gap in quantum measurement theory by providing a framework for continuous measurement of observables beyond the orthogonal projection postulate, which is a significant motivation in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory.

Method: The authors use mathematical formalism and abstract algebra for the instrumental group (IG), Kraus operator density (KOD), and convolution to develop the instrumental group algebra (IGA) and ultraoperators for both jump and diffusion processes, demonstrating how the IGA generalizes the algebraic structure for quantum channels and measurements.

Result: A comprehensive mathematical framework is presented incorporating the IGA and ultraoperators as the natural structure for continuous quantum measurements, unifying previous treatments of quantum channels and providing a new perspective on the evolution of quantum instruments during measurements.

Conclusion: This work opens new directions for studying the dynamics of quantum measurements and the algebraic structure of quantum instruments, offering a unified framework for future research in quantum measurement theory and quantum information processing.

Abstract: Many of the most fundamental observables | position, momentum, phase-point,
and spin-direction | cannot be measured by an instrument that obeys the
orthogonal projection postulate. Continuous-in-time measurements provide the
missing theoretical framework to make sense of such observables. The elements
of the time-dependent instrument define a group called the \emph{instrumental
group} (IG). Relative to the IG, all of the time-dependence is contained in a
certain function called the \emph{Kraus-operator density} (KOD), which evolves
according to a classical Kolmogorov equation. Unlike the Lindblad master
equation, the KOD Kolmogorov equation is a direct expression of how the
elements of the instrument (not just the total channel) evolve. Shifting from
continuous measurement to sequential measurements more generally, the structure
of combining instruments in sequence is shown to correspond to the convolution
of their KODs. This convolution promotes the IG to an \emph{involutive Banach
algebra} (a structure that goes all the way back to the origins of POVM and
C*-algebra theory) which will be called the \emph{instrumental group algebra}
(IGA). The IGA is the true home of the KOD, similar to how the dual of a von
Neumann algebra is the home of the density operator. Operators on the IGA,
which play the same role for KODs as superoperators play for density operators,
are called \emph{ultraoperators} and various examples are discussed. Certain
ultraoperator-superoperator intertwining relations are considered, including
the relation between the KOD Kolmogorov equation and the Lindblad master
equation. The IGA is also shown to have actually two involutions: one respected
by the convolution ultraoperators and the other by the quantum channel
superoperators. Finally, the KOD Kolmogorov generators are derived for jump
processes and more general diffusive processes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum optimization framework for constrained problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling constraints in quantum optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses it by proposing a multi-objective approach with rigorous guarantees.

Method: MOQA framework is introduced, which handles constraints by approximating maximums using smaller p-norms, compatible with various ground-state solvers.

Result: The framework effectively solves constrained optimization problems with performance guarantees.

Conclusion: MOQA expands the scope of quantum optimization beyond unconstrained tasks, offering reliable solutions for real-world challenges.

Abstract: Encoding combinatorial optimization problems into physically meaningful
Hamiltonians with tractable energy landscapes forms the foundation of quantum
optimization. Numerous works have studied such efficient encodings for the
class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. However,
many real-world tasks are constrained, and handling equality and, in
particular, inequality constraints on quantum computers remains a major
challenge. In this letter, we show that including inequality constraints is
equivalent to solving a multi-objective optimization. This insight motivates
the Multi-Objective Quantum Approximation (MOQA) framework, which approximates
the maximum via smaller $p$-norms and comes with rigorous performance
guarantees. MOQA operates directly at the Hamiltonian level and is compatible
with, but not restricted to, ground-state solvers such as quantum adiabatic
annealing, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), or
imaginary-time evolution. Moreover, it is not limited to quadratic functions.

Abstract: The prospect of quantum solutions for complicated optimization problems is
contingent on mapping the original problem onto a tractable quantum energy
landscape, e.g. an Ising-type Hamiltonian. Subsequently, techniques like
adiabatic optimization, quantum annealing, and the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) can be used to find the ground state of this
Hamiltonian. Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is one
prominent problem class for which this entire pipeline is well understood and
has received considerable attention over the past years. In this work, we
provide novel, tractable mappings for the maxima of multiple QUBO problems.
Termed Multi-Objective Quantum Approximations, or MOQA for short, our framework
allows us to recast new types of classical binary optimization problems as
ground state problems of a tractable Ising-type Hamiltonian. This, in turn,
opens the possibility of new quantum- and quantum-inspired solutions to a
variety of problems that frequently occur in practical applications. In
particular, MOQA can handle various types of routing and partitioning problems,
as well as inequality-constrained binary optimization problems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Photonic QELMs outperform multi-layer perceptron baselines in classification tasks with faster retraining and fixed latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper proposes a photonic-based extreme learning machine for efficient processing of collider data, aiming to enhance classification performance with minimal computational overhead.

Method: Data encoding using photonic modes, Gaussian quantum substrate for processing, and Gaussian measurements for readout. Classification is achieved using a linear classifier trained with a single linear solve.

Result: The photonic QELM surpasses MLPs with two hidden units in all training sizes and matches or exceeds those with ten hidden units at larger datasets, while requiring only linear readout training.

Conclusion: This suggests that photonic extreme learning machines can offer effective and efficient alternatives for online data processing in high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: We study continuous-variable photonic quantum extreme learning machines as
fast, low-overhead front-ends for collider data processing. Data is encoded in
photonic modes through quadrature displacements and propagated through a
fixed-time Gaussian quantum substrate. The final readout occurs through
Gaussian-compatible measurements to produce a high-dimensional random feature
map. Only a linear classifier is trained, using a single linear solve, so
retraining is fast, and the optical path and detector response set the
analytical and inference latency. We evaluate this architecture on two
representative classification tasks, top-jet tagging and Higgs-boson
identification, with parameter-matched multi-layer perceptron (MLP) baselines.
Using standard public datasets and identical train, validation, and test
splits, the photonic Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) outperforms an MLP
with two hidden units for all considered training sizes, and matches or exceeds
an MLP with ten hidden units at large sample sizes, while training only the
linear readout. These results indicate that Gaussian photonic extreme-learning
machines can provide compact and expressive random features at fixed latency.
The combination of deterministic timing, rapid retraining, low optical power,
and room temperature operation makes photonic QELMs a credible building block
for online data selection and even first-stage trigger integration at future
collider experiments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a decoding framework for correlated errors in quantum LDPC codes
under circuit-level noise. The core of our approach is a graph augmentation and
rewiring for interference (GARI) method, which modifies the correlated detector
error model by eliminating 4-cycles involving Y-type errors, while preserving
the equivalence of the decoding problem. We test our approach on the bivariate
bicycle codes of distances 6, 10, and 12. A normalized min-sum decoder with a
hybrid serial-layered schedule is applied on the transformed graph, achieving
high accuracy with low latency. Performance is further enhanced through
ensemble decoding, where 24 randomized normalized min-sum decoders run in
parallel on the transformed graph, yielding the highest reported accuracy (on
par with XYZ-Relay-BP) with unprecedented speed for the tested codes under
uniform depolarizing circuit level noise. For the distance 12 (gross) code, our
approach yields a logical error rate of $(6.70 \pm 1.93) \times 10^{-9}$ at a
practical physical error rate of $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, preliminary FPGA
implementation results show that such high accuracy can be achieved in real
time, with a per-round average decoding latency of 273 ns and sub-microsecond
latency in 99.99% of the decoding instances.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As the scope of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) grows to encompass ever
larger problem scales, so does the interest in whether quantum computing can
provide an advantage. In recent years, Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA) and
Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QLBM) have emerged as promising candidates
for quantum-native implementations of CFD solvers. Though the progress in
developing QLGA and QLBM algorithms has been significant, it has largely
focused on the development of models rather than applications. As a result, the
zoo of QLGA and QLBM algorithms has grown to target several equations and to
support many extensions, but the practical use of these models is largely
limited to quantum state tomography and observable measurement. This limitation
is crucial in practice, because unless very specific criteria are met, such
measurements may cancel out any potential quantum advantage. In this paper, we
propose an application based on discrete optimization and quantum search, which
circumvents flow field measurement altogether. We propose methods for
simulating many different lattice configurations simultaneously and describe
how the usage of amplitude estimation and quantum search can provide an
asymptotic quantum advantage. Throughout the paper, we provide detailed
complexity analyses of gate-level implementations of our circuits and consider
the benefits and costs of several encodings.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of quantum computing,
enabling reliable information processing in the presence of noise. Sparse
stabilizer codes -- referred to generally as quantum low-density parity-check
(QLDPC) codes -- have risen to the forefront of QEC research in recent years.
This can be attributed to several key factors. First, classical LDPC codes
admit low-complexity belief propagation iterative decoding and near-capacity
performance, which contributed to the early interest in QLDPC codes. Then, the
result promising constant overhead fault tolerance using QLDPC codes led to the
search for code families that go beyond the long-holding $\sqrt{n}$ scaling
barrier of minimum distance for codelength $n$. This resulted in recent
breakthroughs in the construction of QLDPC codes, which, combined with
efficient decoding algorithms and the development of fault-tolerant protocols
operating on QLDPC-encoded quantum information, provide a promising pathway to
low-overhead, fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, despite their
potential, challenges remain, particularly in constructing and decoding
finite-length codes that account for, or efficiently leverage, specific
characteristics of quantum hardware, such as connectivity, topology, native
gate sets, and noise models. This article provides an in-depth examination of
QLDPC codes and their iterative decoders, catering to an information theory
audience with no or limited background in quantum mechanics. We discuss the
theoretical underpinnings, explore unique characteristics of quantum channels,
and delineate key code constructions and decoding algorithms, ultimately
highlighting the impact and future prospects of QLDPC codes in quantum
information science.

*Yi Shi,Eran Ginossar,Michael Stern,Marzena Szymanska*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Superconducting circuits have become a leading candidate for creating robust qubits with long coherence times. This paper proposes an interacting spin model requiring at least four spins with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings. The qubit manifold is symmetric-protected, making it resistant to relaxation and dephasing from local perturbations. The model is mapped to superconducting circuits, demonstrating that such circuits can achieve coherence times exceeding several milliseconds under realistic environmental noise. In summary, this work presents a promising path for creating qubits with long-term stability in future quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research stems from the crucial role of qubits with long coherence times in quantum computing, particularly for fault-tolerant and scalable quantum devices. Maintaining low noise levels and preserving quantum information reliably are bottleneck challenges. The proposed method addresses these issues by leveraging superconducting circuits and symmetry-protected qubits.

Method: The authors utilize an interacting spin model approach, requiring at least four spins with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings. The edge effects are minimized through the use of periodic boundary conditions. Hardware parameters include flux bias, inter- and intra-spin couplings, and an external magnetic field. The operation occurs in a regime of weak, long-range tunneling, where the qubit manifold is established to withstand local perturbations such as relaxation and dephasing. Verification is done by numerical diagonalization of the 8-spin system in a magnetic field.

Result: Numerical simulations of an 8-spin system in realistic noise conditions reveal persistent coherence times of over 4 milliseconds. This result confirms the potential of the spin model-based superconducting circuits in achieving long coherence times. The coherence time is demonstrated to remain stable even with environmental noise, indicating robustness of the proposed qubit manifold.

Conclusion: This work presents a breakthrough in the development of robust qubits with long coherence times in superconducting circuits. For future research, valuable directions include expanding the spin model to larger systems, implementing more complex interactions, and considering different noise models to enhance the robustness of the qubit manifold.

Abstract: Superconducting circuits are one of the leading candidates for storing and
manipulating quantum information. Among them, qubits embedded with intrinsic
noise protection have seen rapid advancements in recent years. This noise
protection is typically realized by isolating the computational states from
local sources of noise. Here, we propose an interacting spin model that
requires at least four spins with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor
couplings, where the two lowest eigenstates form a symmetry-protected qubit
manifold, which is robust to both relaxation and dephasing from local
perturbations. We map the spin model to a superconducting circuit and show that
such a circuit can reach coherence times exceeding several milliseconds in the
presence of realistic environmental noise. Our work opens a pathway to
realizing qubits with long coherence times in a new generation of quantum
devices.

### [118] [Universal energy-space localization and stable quantum phases against time-dependent perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14160)
*Hongye Yu,Tzu-Chieh Wei*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We identify a universal phenomenon in q-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization, which can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations. This implies that widely applicable rigorous proofs of stability against time-dependent perturbations should be possible. The leakage bounds depend on the energy distance from the initial state but cannot be shortened under evolution time rescaling. Our results show that in many existing systems, the energy-space localization implies additional localization in configuration space. For quantum error-correcting codes, the evolving state stays near the original codeword for very long time regardless of the perturbation. We also improve the robustness of quantum memory thresholds and extend our results to not-necessarily quasi-q-local perturbations. This work demonstrates a new approach to analyze stability against generic time-dependent perturbations in many quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum system stability under time-dependent perturbations is crucial for quantum error correction, quantum memory, and quantum algorithms. While rigorous proofs for time-independent perturbations are established, the time-dependent case remains challenging. Our work provides a new framework and tools to address this issue, which should be highly relevant to researchers working on quantum many-body systems and Hamiltonian-based quantum computation.

Method: We introduce a concept called energy-space localization which can survive arbitrary time-dependent perturbations. The method builds upon the analysis of energy level dynamics and provides a way to bound the state leakage into other regions of the instantaneous spectrum under time-dependent perturbations. This approach can be extended to a variety of models, including localized spin models, spin glasses, quantum error-correcting codes, and others.

Result: Energy-space localization: formerly difficult-to-analyze systems now become manageable; No need for static perturbation hypotheses; New bounds on the lifetime; Provides a rigorous framework; Holds even for time-dependent perturbations of significant strength.

Conclusion: The emergence of energy-space localization provides a promising framework to address the difficulty of time-dependent perturbations. This opens new directions for rigorous proofs of stability and other long-standing open problems in many-body quantum systems, quantum information science, and beyond.

Abstract: Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum
systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where
stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are
considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent
perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal
phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove
that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the
evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the
instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds
remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This
flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in
proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration
spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space
can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break
ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several
systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving
state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time
even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability
of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In
addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with
clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum
Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work
provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic
quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and
quantum algorithm design.

Abstract: We revisit the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model to explore hydrogen-like ions of
Uranium ($Z=92$), Oganesson ($Z=118$), and hypothetical superheavy elements

self-intersecting orbits in super strong Coulomb fields, beginning with
Oganesson and hypothetical elements up to $Z\le137$. These orbits can be
classified by their `winding' numbers, providing a simple topological

*Graeme D. Berk,Kavan Modi,Simon Milz*

TL;DR: This paper introduces quantifiers for the practical utility of quantum processes and shows how they can be used to improve noise reduction in quantum control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and quantifying the utility of quantum processes is crucial for advancing quantum information protocols and control tasks, especially in the presence of noise.

Method: The authors introduce new quantifiers inspired by state-based approaches and demonstrate their application in noise reduction of a quantum process under open-loop control. They utilize these quantifiers to analyze the largest temporal mutual information achievable by a process and connect them to generalised comb divergences.

Result: The key findings include the identification of quantifiers that satisfy monotonicity properties, allowing for a more accurate assessment of process utility. These quantifiers are applied to noise reduction, revealing that they represent the maximal temporal mutual information of a process. Additionally, the quantifiers are connected to generalised comb divergences, and the paper re-evaluates previous numerical findings related to dynamical decoupling and non-Markovian memory, confirming the interpretation of dynamical decoupling as a resource distillation process.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust framework for quantifying and utilizing the utility of quantum processes, enhancing the understanding of noise reduction techniques and their implications for quantum control applications.

Abstract: The correlation structure of multitime quantum processes - succinctly
described by quantum combs - is an important resource for many quantum
information protocols and control tasks. Inspired by approaches for quantum
states, we introduce quantifiers of the practical utility of quantum processes
that satisfy monotonicity properties, thus overcoming shortcomings in previous
state-motivated approaches. Applying these quantifiers to the problem of noise
reduction of a quantum process under open-loop control, they are shown to
represent the largest amount of temporal mutual information that a process can
possibly exhibit. In addition, we study their resource composition behaviour
and connect them to the recently introduced notion of generalised comb
divergences. Finally, in light of these new quantifiers, we re-interpret the
numerical findings of npj Quantum Information 9, 104 (2023) on the relationship
of dynamical decoupling and non-Markovian memory, which were based on
insufficient resource quantifiers, and show that its main conclusion - the
interpretation of dynamical decoupling as a resource distillation - still
holds.

Motivation: 随着量子计算机的发展，评估传统密码系统在量子环境下的安全性变得愈发重要。该论文针对异或类函数提出了有效的量子攻击方法，并扩展了这种攻击的适用范围。

Method:  paper introduces a new method of quantum attack on XOR-type functions by utilizing double parallel permutation-based pseudorandom functions. This method is applied to specific cryptographic structures such as block ciphers to reduce the required resources. Additionally, the paper presents a novel technique to decouple the XOR-type function, enabling an offline quantum attack with reduced query complexity. The attack is analyzed in both quantum and classical query models, demonstrating significant improvements in complexity. 

Result:  The key results include: 1) Identification of new cryptographic structures (PolyMAC and TPP-PRFs-based block ciphers) that are susceptible to the attack. 2) Extension of Shi et al.'s work by developing an offline quantum attack without online queries. 3) Reduction of query complexity from ?O(2^{(n+t)/2}) to ?O(2^t) in quantum model and further to ?O(2^{(2n-t)/3}) in classical model. This advancement provides more efficient attack methods for evaluating cryptographic security in quantum environments. 

Conclusion:  The paper makes significant contributions to quantum cryptanalysis by presenting new attack methods and expanded attack surfaces. It provides valuable insights for evaluating and improving the security of cryptographic systems against quantum threats. The improved attack complexities highlight the urgency of developing quantum-resistant cryptographic standards. 

Abstract: Quantum cryptanalysis is essential for evaluating the security of
cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computing. Recently, Shi et
al. introduced the dedicated quantum attack on XOR-type function that greatly
reduces the required resources (including circuit depth, width, and the number
of gates) compared to the parallel Grover-meets-Simon algorithm. Here, our
contribution is in two aspects. On the one hand, we discover new cryptographic
structures amenable to this attack: PolyMAC and block ciphers based on two
parallel permutation-based pseudorandom functions (TPP-PRFs), including XopEM,
SoEM22, SUMPIP, and DS-SoEM, partially answering Shi et al.'s open question. On
the other hand, for block ciphers based on TPP-PRFs, we break the obstacle that
this attack rely on online query by constructing decoupled XOR-type function,
then propose an offline quantum attack on them. Compared to previous results,
our offline attack exhibits significantly reduced query complexity.
Specifically, we reduce the number of queries to the encryption oracle from
$\tilde O(2^{(n+t)/2})$ to $\tilde O(2^{t})$ with the same time complexity in
the quantum query model, and enable its implementation in the classical query
model, optimizing both the classical query complexity and time complexity from
$\tilde O(2^{(2n)/3})$ to $\tilde O(2^{(2n-t)/3})$.

Conclusion: 随着量子计算的快速发展，提升量子强化学习在组合优化中的有效性与可推广性将变得越来越重要。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of generalization in quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) for combinatorial optimization, focusing on the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Training quantum policies on large TSP
instances is often infeasible, so existing QRL approaches are limited to
small-scale problems. To mitigate this, we employed Equivariant Quantum
Circuits (EQCs) that respect the permutation symmetry of the TSP graph.
  This symmetry-aware ansatz enabled zero-shot transfer of trained parameters
from $n-$city training instances to larger m-city problems. Building on recent
theory showing that equivariant architectures avoid barren plateaus and
generalize well, we derived novel generalization bounds for the transfer
setting. Our analysis introduces a term quantifying the structural
dissimilarity between $n-$ and $m-$node TSPs, yielding an upper bound on
performance loss under transfer. Empirically, we trained EQC-based policies on
small $n-$city TSPs and evaluated them on larger instances, finding that they
retained strong performance zero-shot and further improved with fine-tuning,
consistent with classical observations of positive transfer between scales.
These results demonstrate that embedding permutation symmetry into quantum
models yields scalable QRL solutions for combinatorial tasks, highlighting the
crucial role of equivariance in transferable quantum learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding strong quantum coupling in light-matter systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and metrology.

Method: The authors use a Bogoliubov transformation in the conservative case and third quantization in the dissipative case to construct a quantum model based on polariton eigenmodes.

Result: The method enables the enhancement of interaction strength and the engineering of nonlocal many-body interactions, leading to strongly nonclassical light correlations.

Conclusion: This framework provides a systematic way to design and realize exotic quantum states of light in engineered nanostructures, paving the way for novel quantum devices and technologies.

Abstract: Light-matter interaction in the regime of strong quantum coupling is usually
treated within the framework of the Hopfield model. However, the picture of
coupling well-defined modes of light and matter is correct only as long as the
shapes of these eigenmodes are not substantially modified by the interaction.
Moreover, parameters of theoretical models are usually obtained by fitting to
experimental data. To date, there has been no straightforward method to
determine a quantum master equation corresponding to a system with specific
dielectric structure, which may lead to incompatibility of theoretical
descriptions and physical realizations. We present a recipe for obtaining a
quantum model in the polariton eigenmode basis based on Bogoliubov
transformation in the conservative case and third quantization technique in the
dissipative case. We show how this method can be used for boosting interaction
strength and engineering nonlocal many-body interactions in carefully designed
nanostructures, resulting in strongly nonclassical correlations of emitted
light.

*Satyaki Manna,Anandamay Das Bhowmik*

TL;DR: The paper investigates the single-shot antidistinguishability of quantum channels, specifically for unitary operations, and establishes that maximally entangled probes are often sufficient for qubit systems, though not necessarily in higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antidistinguishability is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory, and understanding it for unitary operations is crucial for quantum computing and communication.

Method: The authors analyze two scenarios—single-system probes and entangled probes—using tools from quantum information theory, employing concepts like maximally entangled states and their properties in qubit and higher-dimensional systems.

Result: Significant findings include the sufficiency of maximally entangled probes for qubit unitaries and the failure of this sufficiency in dimensions higher than 3. Additionally, the union of two antidistinguishable sets of unitaries also forms an antidistinguishable set.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to our understanding of antidistinguishability for unitary operations, highlighting both universal and dimension-dependent behaviors of probes.

Abstract: The notion of antidistinguishability captures the possibility of ruling out
certain alternatives in a quantum experiment without identifying the actual
outcome. Although extensively studied for quantum states, the
antidistinguishability of quantum channels remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we investigate the single-shot antidistinguishability of unitary
operations. We analyse two scenarios: antidistinguishability with single-system
probes and with entangled probes. For sets of three unitaries, we first prove
that all maximally entangled states are equivalent in their performance as
probe. In the qubit case, we further establish that maximally entangled probes
are always sufficient: if a set of three qubit unitaries is antidistinguishable
with either a single-system or non-maximally entangled probe, then it is also
antidistinguishable with a maximally entangled one. However, in higher
dimension, this equivalence fails. In \textit{dimension 3}, there exists a set
of unitaries that are antidistinguishable with non-maximally entangled probe or
single-system probe but not with maximally entangled probe. We also establish
that union of two antidistinguishable sets of three qubit unitaries also forms
a set of antidistinguishable unitaries. Lastly, we provide methods to construct
antidistinguishable unitaries from non-antidistinguishable ones.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive multiparameter estimation strategy for phase estimation using squeezed light.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to develop a reliable quantum-enhanced sensing framework for practical scenarios and scalable distributed sensor networks.

Method: The method involves an adaptive multiparameter estimation strategy using real-time feedback to jointly estimate the optical phase and squeezing level. This approach ensures robustness against experimental drifts and calibration errors by continuously adjusting the squeezing levels based on the current probe state.

Result: The result is the development of a self-calibrating scheme that maintains optimal estimation performance across the entire parameter range, achieving sub-standard quantum limit precision in the full periodicity interval [0, π).

Conclusion: This research provides a robust and scalable solution for quantum-enhanced phase estimation using squeezed light, opening new possibilities for practical applications in fundamental physics and emerging technologies.

Abstract: Squeezed light enables quantum-enhanced phase estimation, with crucial
applications in both fundamental physics and emerging technologies. To fully
exploit the advantage provided by this approach, estimation protocols must
remain optimal across the entire parameter range and resilient to instabilities
in the probe state. In this context, strategies that rely on pre-calibrated
squeezing levels are vulnerable to degradation over time and become sub-optimal
when experimental conditions fluctuate. Here, we develop an adaptive
multiparameter estimation strategy for ab-initio phase estimation, achieving
sub-standard quantum limit precision in the full periodicity interval
$[0,\pi)$, without relying on prior knowledge of the squeezing parameter. Our
approach employs real-time feedback to jointly estimate both the optical phase
and the squeezing level, ensuring robustness against experimental drifts and
calibration errors. This self-calibrating scheme establishes a reliable
quantum-enhanced sensing framework, opening new routes for practical scenarios
and scalable distributed sensor networks using squeezed light.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum phases and their transitions is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics. Traditional approaches often rely on labeled data, but unsupervised learning offers a new way to explore the parameter space of quantum systems without prior knowledge of the phases.

Method: The authors employ unsupervised learning, specifically spectral clustering, to group quantum ground states. Fidelity between states is used as a similarity metric, which can be estimated experimentally. The method automatically identifies the optimal number of phases using silhouette and elbow analyses.

Result: The benchmarking on spin-1/2 chains shows that the unsupervised learning approach accurately reproduces known phase diagrams. Additionally, the method has the potential to reveal new phases that were previously unknown.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for discovering phases of quantum matter using machine learning techniques. By leveraging unsupervised learning, the approach provides a powerful tool for exploring the complex landscape of quantum phases without prior assumptions about the system.

Abstract: Drawing the quantum phase diagram of a many-body system in the parameter
space of its Hamiltonian can be seen as a learning problem, which implies
labelling the corresponding ground states according to some classification
criterium that defines the phases. In this work we adopt unsupervised learning,
where the algorithm has no access to any priorly labeled states, as a tool for
determining quantum phase diagrams of many-body systems. The algorithm directly
works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different
values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant
way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the
fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even
experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques. We find that
unsupervised learning algorithms based on spectral clustering, combined with
``silhouette'' and ``elbow'' methods for determining the optimal number of
phases, can accurately reproduce the phase diagrams. Our results show how
unsupervised learning can autonomously recognize and possibly unveil novel
phases of quantum matter.

Motivation: Topology is fundamental in quantum field theories, but realizing these symmetries in systems is challenging. This work bridges a gap by using quantum simulators.

Method: Used IBM Kingston simulator with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms inspired by QAOA and natural gradient optimization to create eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians.

Result: Correlation functions measured match classical computations, validating the approach for studying topological symmetries in QFTs.

Conclusion: Noisy quantum simulators offer a viable platform for studying these complex systems, accessible to observables difficult to probe conventionally.

Abstract: Topological symmetries, invertible and otherwise, play a fundamental role in
the investigation of quantum field theories. Despite their ubiquitous
importance across a multitude of disciplines ranging from string theory to
condensed matter physics, controlled realizations of models exhibiting these
symmetries in physical systems are rare. Quantum simulators based on engineered
solid-state devices provide a novel alternative to conventional condensed
matter systems for realizing these models.
  In this work, eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators
associated with the topological symmetries for the Ising conformal field theory
in two space-time dimensions are realized on IBM's Kingston simulator. The
relevant states are created on the quantum device using a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on a variation of the quantum
approximate optimization algorithm ansatz combined with the quantum natural
gradient optimization method. Signatures of the topological symmetry are
captured by measuring correlation functions of different qubit operators with
results obtained from the quantum device in reasonable agreement with those
obtained from classical computations. The current work demonstrates the
viability of noisy quantum simulators as platforms for investigating
low-dimensional quantum field theories with direct access to observables that
are often difficult to probe in conventional condensed matter experiments.

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for extracting
Hamiltonian eigenvalues, but its standard form targets individual eigenstates
and requires carefully prepared coherent inputs. To overcome these limitations,
we adopt an ensemble-based formulation of QPE that estimates the density of
states (DOS) of the Hamiltonian generator of the evolution. This approach,
which we refer to as DOS-QPE, builds on a prior formulation introduced by one
of the authors. In this work, we present DOS-QPE as a circuit primitive,
extending it with symmetry-adapted input ensembles and advanced spectrum
reconstruction techniques. This variant of QPE enables natural access to
thermodynamic properties, symmetry-resolved spectral functions, and features
relevant to quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate its performance on
fermionic models and nuclear Hamiltonians by casting the spectrum
reconstruction problem as a quadratic program solved via compressed sensing.
These use cases highlight the potential of DOS-QPE for early fault-tolerant
quantum simulations in spectroscopy, electronic structure, and nuclear theory.

Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm for structural mechanical
problems, specifically addressing crack opening simulations that traditionally
require extensive computational resources. Our approach provides an alternative
solution for a relevant 2D case by implementing a parametrized quantum circuit
that stores nodal displacements as quantum amplitudes and efficiently extracts
critical observables. The algorithm achieves optimal nodal displacements by
minimizing the elastic energy obtained from finite element method. The energy
is computed with only a polylogarithmic number of measurements. Extracting
relevant scalar observables such as the stress intensity factor is then done
efficiently on the converged solution. To validate the scalability of our
approach, we develop a warm start strategy based on a remeshing technique that
uses coarse solutions to circumvent barren plateaus in the optimization
landscape of the more refined problems. Our method has been experimentally
validated on Quandela's photonic quantum processor Ascella and comprehensive
numerical simulations demonstrate its scalability across increasingly complex

ideal for generating training/benchmarking data for other methods, such as

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum metrology leverages quantum resources such as entanglement and
squeezing to enhance parameter estimation precision beyond classical limits.
While optimal quantum control strategies can assist to reach or even surpass
the Heisenberg limit, their practical implementation often requires the
knowledge of the parameters to be estimated, necessitating adaptive control
methods with feedback. Such adaptive control methods have been considered in
single-parameter quantum metrology, but not much in multi-parameter quantum
metrology so far. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing an efficient
adaptive control strategy for multi-parameter quantum metrology in
two-dimensional systems. By eliminating the trade-offs among optimal
measurements, initial states, and control Hamiltonians through a system
extension scheme, we derive an explicit relation between the estimator variance
and evolution time. Through a reparameterization technique, the optimization of
evolution times in adaptive iterations are obtained, and a recursive relation
is established to characterize the precision improvement across the iterations.
The proposed strategy achieves the optimal performance up to an overall factor
of constant order with only a few iterations and demonstrates strong robustness
against deviations in the errors of control parameters at individual
iterations. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of this strategy for
Hamiltonians with arbitrary parameter dependence. This work provides a
practical approach for multi-parameter quantum metrology with adaptive
Hamiltonian control in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Quantum code surgery is a promising technique to perform fault-tolerant
computation on quantum low-density parity-check codes. Recent developments have
significantly reduced the space overhead of surgery. However, generic surgery
operations still require $O(d)$ rounds of repeated syndrome extraction to be
made fault-tolerant. In this work, we focus on reducing the time overhead of
surgery. We first present a general set of conditions that ensure
fault-tolerant surgery operations can be performed with constant time overhead.
This fast surgery necessarily makes use of an auxiliary complex described by a
hypergraph rather than a graph. We then introduce a concrete scheme called
block reading, which performs transversal surgery across multiple code blocks.
We further investigate surgery operations with intermediate time overhead,
between $O(1)$ and $O(d)$, which apply to quantum locally testable codes.
Finally, we establish a circuit equivalence between homomorphic measurement and
hypergraph surgery and derive bounds on the time overhead of generic logical
measurement schemes. Overall, our results demonstrate that reducing the time
cost of code surgery is not reliant on the quantum memory being single-shot.
Instead it is chiefly the connectivity between a code and its measurement
ancilla system that determines the achievable measurement time overhead.

Abstract: Noise in near-term quantum devices limits the timescales over which
measurements can be reliably obtained. Existing data-driven extrapolation
methods extend the dynamics of quantum observables from measurements, but they
cannot guarantee that the recovered model reflects the true dynamics. In this
paper, we introduce atomic norm minimization as a framework to certify that a
model learned by any algorithm accurately captures the underlying dynamics of
quantum observables. This certification is valid when the system is governed by
a small number of well-separated Bohr frequencies. We validate the framework
across multiple algorithms on numerical experiments with spin-chain
Hamiltonians involving 8-20 qubits. Comparing with exact diagonalization,
certification yields an average forecasting error below 0.1 (within the
observable's range of $[-1, 1]$) in 98% of cases and below 0.05 in 89-97% of
cases, depending on the forecasting algorithm. Even in the presence of
realistic shot noise, certified models remain robust, with success rates
decreasing only to 88-95% for the 0.1 error threshold.

Abstract: Quantum teleportation enables high-security communications through end-to-end
quantum entangled pairs. End-to-end entangled pairs are created by using
swapping processes to consume short entangled pairs and generate long pairs.
However, due to environmental interference, entangled pairs decohere over time,
resulting in low fidelity. Thus, generating entangled pairs at the right time
is crucial. Moreover, the swapping process also causes additional fidelity
loss. To this end, this paper presents a short time slot protocol, where a time
slot can only accommodate a process. It has a more flexible arrangement of
entangling and swapping processes than the traditional long time slot protocol.
It raises a new optimization problem TETRIS for finding strategies of
entangling and swapping for each request to maximize the fidelity sum of all
accepted requests. To solve the TETRIS, we design two novel algorithms with
different optimization techniques. Finally, the simulation results manifest
that our algorithms can outperform the existing methods by up to 60 ~ 78% in
general, and by 20 ~ 75% even under low entangling probabilities.

Abstract: We investigate current fluctuations in open quantum systems beyond the
weak-coupling and Markovian regimes, focusing on a coherently driven qubit
strongly coupled to a structured bosonic environment. By combining full
counting statistics with the reaction coordinate mapping, we develop a
framework that enables the calculation of steady-state current fluctuations and
their temporal correlations in the strong-coupling regime. Our analysis reveals
that, unlike in weak coupling, both the average current and its fluctuations
exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on the system-environment interaction strength.
Notably, we identify a regime where current noise is suppressed below the
classical thermodynamic uncertainty bound, coinciding with enhanced
anticorrelations in quantum jump trajectories and faster system relaxation. We
further show that these features are linked to nonclassical properties of the
reaction coordinate mode, such as non-Gaussianity and quantum coherence. Our
results provide new insights and design principles for controlling current
fluctuations in quantum devices operating beyond the standard weak-coupling
paradigm.

Abstract: In multiparameter quantum metrology, the ultimate precision of joint
estimation is dictated by the Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound. In this paper, we
discuss and analyze in detail an alternative approach: the stepwise estimation
strategy. In this approach, parameters are estimated sequentially, using an
optimized fraction of the total available resources allocated to each step. We
derive a tight and achievable precision bound for this protocol, the stepwise
separable bound, and provide its closed-form analytical expression, revealing a
crucial dependence on the chosen measurement ordering. We provide a rigorous
comparison with the joint measurement strategy, deriving analytical conditions
that determine when the stepwise approach offers superior precision. Through
the analysis of several paradigmatic SU(2) unitary encoding models, we
demonstrate that the stepwise strategy can indeed outperform joint
measurements, particularly in scenarios characterized by non-optimal probes or
models with a high degree of sloppiness. Our findings establish stepwise
estimation as a powerful alternative to joint and collective measurements,
proving that sequential protocols can provide a genuine metrological advantage,
especially in resource-constrained or imperfect experimental settings.

Abstract: Photoreduction of cryptochrome protein in the retina is a well-known
mechanism of navigation of birds through the geomagnetic field, yet the
biosignal nature of the mechanism remains unclear. The absorption of blue light
by the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore can alter the distribution
of electrons in cryptochrome and create radical pairs with separated charges.
In this study, the spin dynamics of electrons in the radical pair and its
coupling with spatial position were investigated by computational modeling from
a quantum mechanical perspective. Several interactions were considered in the
presence of an external magnetic field, and the resulting electric dipole
moment in cryptochrome was computed as the quantity emerging from this
coupling. The computations show the induced electric dipole moment clearly
depend on the characteristics of the applied magnetic field even after
considering dissipative effects. In fact, our findings indicate that the
radical pair in cryptochrome protein is a magnetic biosensor, in the sense that
in the presence of the geomagnetic field, variations in spin states can
influence its electric dipole moment, which may be interpreted via the bird as
an orientation signal. The results can be used in the advancement of
bio-inspired technologies which replicate animal magnetic sensitivity. On the
other hand, with increasing concern about the detrimental effects of
electromagnetic fields on wildlife and human health, studying the phenomenon of
magnetoreception can contribute to a deeper understanding of how biological
structures interact with these fields.

Abstract: Microtubules stochastically switch between growth and shrinkage during
catastrophe events across a very large range of filament lengths, with the
length distribution at catastrophe peaking at a finite filament length, which
can aid the search for chromosomes during mitosis. To model these distinct
features, we introduce a topological model of a two-component microtubule cap,
where protected edge states give rise to different phases of microtubule
dynamics - growth, shrinkage, and a recently observed "stutter" phase. With
only two free parameters, our model quantitatively reproduces the peaked
catastrophe length distribution and its dependence on tubulin concentration
from experimental data. The model further provides an analytical condition for
when the catastrophe length distribution is peaked. Our work shows how
microtubules may utilize topological edge states to promote length exploration,
elucidating a novel mechanism for search and target reaching in cellular
biology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how cellular aggregates adapt to confinement is crucial for insights into tissue mechanics and disease states like cancer.

Method: Microscopy and computer simulations were used to study cellular aggregates compressed between solids, observing dynamic transitions and forces involved.

Result: The aggregates form capillary bridges that transition from compressed spheres to liquid-like states. Their stability is influenced by cell growth and spreading, with rupture occurring at specific length scales. Simulations reveal how mechanical and biological factors govern these transitions.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new class of active soft matter behavior in biological tissues, highlighting the interplay between mechanical principles and biological activity in shaping tissue dynamics.

Abstract: Biological tissues exhibit complex behaviors with their dynamics often
resembling inert soft matter such as liquids, polymers, colloids, and liquid
crystals. These analogies enable physics-based approaches for investigations of
emergent behaviors in biological processes. A well-studied case is the
spreading of cellular aggregates on solid surfaces, where they display dynamics
similar to viscous droplets. \textit{In vivo}, however, cells and tissues are
in a confined environment with varying geometries and mechanical properties to
which they need to adapt. In this work, we compressed cellular aggregates
between two solid surfaces and studied their dynamics using microscopy, and
computer simulations. The confined cellular aggregates transitioned from
compressed spheres into dynamic living capillary bridges exhibiting bridge
thinning and a convex-to-concave meniscus curvature transition. We found that
the stability of the bridge is determined by the interplay between cell growth
and cell spreading on the confining surfaces. This interaction leads to bridge
rupture at a critical length scale determined by the distance between the
plates. The force distributions, formation and stability regimes of the living
capillary bridges were characterized with full 3D computer simulations that
included cell division, migration and growth dynamics, directly showing how
mechanical principles govern the behavior of the living bridges; cellular
aggregates display jamming and stiffening analogously to granular matter, and
cell division along the long axis enhances thinning. Based on our results, we
propose a new class of active soft matter behavior, where cellular aggregates
exhibit liquid-like adaptation to confinement, but with self-organized
rupturing driven by biological activity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need to understand and address human disruption of wildlife communication and to develop methods for controlling insect populations carrying pathogens.

Method: The research involves modeling active auditory systems and mosquito hearing, testing various masking strategies across different frequency modulations.

Result: Masking with concentrated acoustic power in specific frequencies is most effective for maximizing disturbance. Rapid frequency modulation masks are optimal for disrupting information transfer and reducing intelligibility.

Conclusion: The findings provide guidelines for selecting appropriate masking signals to either enhance or suppress communication in biological systems.

Abstract: The use of auditory masking has long been of interest in psychoacoustics and
for engineering purposes, in order to cover sounds that are disruptive to
humans or to species whose habitats overlap with ours. In most cases, we seek
to minimize the disturbances to the communication of wildlife. However, in the
case of pathogen-carrying insects, we may want to maximize these disturbances
as a way to control populations. In the current work, we explore candidate
masking strategies for a generic model of active auditory systems and a model
of the mosquito auditory system. For both models, we find that masks with all
acoustic power focused into just one or a few frequencies perform best. We
propose that masks based on rapid frequency modulation are most effective for
maximal disruption of information transfer and minimizing intelligibility. We
hope that these results will serve to guide the avoidance or selection of
possible acoustic signals for, respectively, maximizing or minimizing
communication.

TL;DR: -paper introduces Data-Driven Quantized Skeletal Learning (QSL) for generating skeletal mechanisms through a weight vector and differentiable program trained with l1 regularization. QSL variants QSL-R and QSL-S focus on eliminating reactions and species, respectively. The method is validated on methane and ethylene mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deriving skeletal mechanisms is essential for combustion research, but detailed mechanisms are often too complex. This paper proposes a data-driven, efficient approach to simplify them.

Method: QSL uses a weight vector to eliminate species and reactions; the method is differentiable, allowing for end-to-end training. l1 regularization promotes sparsity, enabling automatic elimination of less important elements.

Result: QSL successfully generates skeletal mechanisms for methane and ethylene with various levels of fidelity. Analysis shows reliable extraction of skeletal mechanisms through ignition delay times and species mass fractions.

Conclusion: QSL provides a novel, efficient method for deriving simplified skeletal mechanisms, making combustion research more accessible and practical.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven approach, referred to as Quantized Skeletal
Learning (QSL), for generating skeletal mechanisms. The approach has two key
components: (1) a weight vector that can be used to eliminate relatively
unimportant species and reactions, and (2) an end-to-end differentiable program
whose loss-function gradients, with respect to the weight vector, can be used
to adjust those weights. To promote sparsity in the weight vector -- and to
reduce the influence of certain reactions or species to zero -- an
$l_1$-regularized objective is employed alongside the standard mean squared
error loss, thus removing the least important components. The proposed QSL
approach is validated by generating skeletal mechanisms for methane and
ethylene based on the GRI 3.0 and USC II mechanisms, respectively,
demonstrating effectiveness in deriving skeletal mechanisms with various levels
of fidelity. Two variants of QSL, designated as QSL-R and QSL-S, are tested;
these focus on eliminating reactions and species, respectively. Analysis of
ignition delay times and species mass fractions demonstrate QSL's capabilities
to reliably and efficiently extract data-driven skeletal mechanisms of varying
fidelities from detailed mechanisms.

Abstract: Shadow molecular dynamics provide an efficient and stable atomistic
simulation framework for flexible charge models with long-range electrostatic
interactions. While previous implementations have been limited to atomic
monopole charge distributions, we extend this approach to flexible multipole
models. We derive detailed expressions for the shadow energy functions,
potentials, and force terms, explicitly incorporating monopole-monopole,
dipole-monopole, and dipole-dipole interactions. In our formulation, both
atomic monopoles and atomic dipoles are treated as extended dynamical variables
alongside the propagation of the nuclear degrees of freedom. We demonstrate
that introducing the additional dipole degrees of freedom preserves the
stability and accuracy previously seen in monopole-only shadow molecular
dynamics simulations. Additionally, we present a shadow molecular dynamics
scheme where the monopole charges are held fixed while the dipoles remain
flexible. Our extended shadow dynamics provide a framework for stable,
computationally efficient, and versatile molecular dynamics simulations
involving long-range interactions between flexible multipoles. This is of
particular interest in combination with modern artificial intelligence and
machine learning techniques, which are increasingly used to develop
physics-informed and data-driven foundation models for atomistic simulations.
These models aim to provide transferable, high-accuracy representations of
atomic interactions that are applicable across diverse sets of molecular
systems, which requires accurate treatment of long-range charge interactions.

TL;DR: The paper presents a modified semi-classical IVR method for the imaginary-time propagator that avoids the divergence issue of the HK IVR in the high-temperature limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity arises from the limitation of the HK IVR in the high-temperature limit, prompting the development of an alternative method.

Method: Modified HK IVR using a real Gaussian function to calculate the matrix element of the Boltzmann operator in imaginary time.

Result: The new method is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators and shows effectiveness through numerical examples.

Conclusion: The proposed IVR provides a divergence-free alternative to the HK IVR and expands its applicability in quantum physics.

Abstract: The coherent-state initial-value representation (IVR) for the semi-classical
real-time propagator of a quantum system, developed by Herman and Kluk (HK), is
widely used in computational studies of chemical dynamics. On the other hand,
the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)}$, with $\hat{H}$,$k_B$, and $T$
representing the Hamiltonian, Boltzmann constant, and temperature,
respectively, plays a crucial role in chemical physics and other branches of
quantum physics. One might naturally assume that a semi-classical IVR for the
matrix element of this operator in the coordinate representation (i.e., $
\langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, or the imaginary-time
propagator) could be derived via a straightforward ``real-time $\rightarrow$
imaginary-time transformation'' from the HK IVR of the real-time propagator.
However, this is not the case, as such a transformation results in a divergence
in the high-temperature limit $(T \rightarrow \infty)$. In this work, we solve
this problem and develop a reasonable HK-like semi-classical IVR for $\langle
\tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, specifically for systems where
the gradient of the potential energy (i.e., the force intensity) has a finite
upper bound. The integrand in this IVR is a real Gaussian function of the
positions $x$ and $\tilde{x}$, which facilitates its application to realistic
problems. Our HK-like IVR is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators,
and its effectiveness for other systems is demonstrated through numerical
examples.

Abstract: We consider the quantitative description of a many-particle gas of
interacting abelian anyons in the plane, confined in a trapping potential. If
the anyons are modeled as bosons with a magnetic flux attachment, and if the
total magnetic flux is small compared to the number of particles, then an
average-field description becomes appropriate for the low-energy collective
state of the gas. Namely, by means of a Hartree-Jastrow ansatz, we derive a
two-parameter Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger energy functional which extends the
well-known Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schr\"odinger density functional theory
to the magnetic (anyonic) self-interaction. One parameter determines the total
number of self-generated magnetic flux units in the system, and the other the
effective strength of spin-orbit self-interaction. This latter interaction can
be either attractive/focusing or repulsive/defocusing, and depends both on the
intrinsic spin-orbit interaction and the relative length scale of the flux
profile of the anyons. Densities and energies of ground and excited states are
studied analytically and numerically for a wide range of the parameters and
align well with a sequence of exact nonlinear Landau levels describing
Jackiw-Pi self-dual solitons. With increasing flux, counter-rotating vortices
are formed, enhancing the stability of the gas against collapse. Apart from
clarifying the relations between various different anyon models that have
appeared in the literature, our analysis sheds considerable new light on the
many-anyon spectral problem, and also exemplifies a novel
supersymmetry-breaking phenomenon.

Abstract: We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a
medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a
Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a
stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without
relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable
even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is
further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels
around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only
for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of
uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to
validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion
or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method
provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental
setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the
sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and
assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the
inferred beam energy.

Abstract: We present a unified framework that fully represents electromagnetic
potentials, fields, and sources in vacuum, based on a reinterpretation of the
classical Hertz-potential formalism. In this construction, $\phi$, $A$, $E$,
$B$, $\rho$, and $J$ are systematically derived from a single vector wavefield
$\Gamma(x, t)$ (called the "$\Gamma$-potential"), which is structurally aligned
with the classical electric Hertz potential but of broader scope. A surjective
mapping is established from such wavefields to all electromagnetic
configurations in vacuum (that are sufficiently regular). This mapping induces
a well-defined algebraic correspondence between the solution space of Maxwell's
equations and the linear space of $C_t^{3} C_x^{3}$ vector wavefields (modulo
the relevant symmetries), thereby enabling a framework for structural analysis
of electromagnetic fields via their associated wavefields. Gauge freedom and
the Lorenz gauge are naturally preserved; charge conservation and Maxwell's
equations are inherently encoded in this representation.
  Building on this framework, we also introduce a transformation that provides
a systematic method for generating new electromagnetic solutions from known
ones. This transformation, called the "$\Gamma$-transformation", generalizes
classical gauge transformations and may facilitate the exploration of hidden
structures and symmetries in the solution space of Maxwell's equations.

### [151] [Extra force in charged resonant capacitors: a new macroscopic effect of vacuum fluctuations ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21432)
*Yury Minenkov,Massimo Bassan*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses an unexpected large tuning in the mechanical vibrations of resonant capacitive transducers, likely due to an additional attractive force caused by vacuum fluctuations within the transducer gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need to understand and explain the unexpected tuning behavior in capacitive transducers, which could have implications for their design and application.

Method: The study involved measuring resonant frequency variations under different electric fields, temperatures, and configurations using parallel plates with varying gaps.

Result: The measurements revealed an unusually large tuning effect caused by an additional, unanticipated attractive force. This force exhibited divergent behavior, with significant changes even before reaching a critical electrical field.

Conclusion: The cause of the observed force is likely non-conventional, suggesting vacuum fluctuations as a possible explanation. Further research is needed to confirm this mechanism.

Abstract: We report on measurements of the mechanical vibrations of the fundamental
mode of resonant capacitive transducers, consisting of parallel plates at
different gaps (10 - 26 $\mu$m). Resonant frequency data were taken vs the
electric field at constant charge, at various temperatures and different
configurations. All measurements exhibited unexpectedly large tuning, caused by
an additional, unpredicted attractive force. Such force has a divergent
behaviour characterized by a critical electrical field and start to diverge
long before the critical point. Many known physical mechanisms have been
considered to explain this force, but all of them had to be discarded. Thus, we
turn to non-conventional physical mechanisms and suggest that vacuum
fluctuations inside the gap could be a possible cause of this anomalous force.
