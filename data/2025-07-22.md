### [1] [Time-resolved solvation of alkali ions in superfluid helium nanodroplets: Theoretical simulation of a pump-probe study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14674)
*Ernesto García-Alfonso,Manuel Barranco,Martí Pi,Nadine Halberstadt*

Main category: physics.atm-clus

TL;DR: This paper investigates the solvation process of alkali ions in superfluid helium using theoretical models, revealing dynamics and stabilization mechanisms of the solvation structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The solvation in superfluid helium is a complex process involving quantum and many-body effects, making it challenging to model. This paper uses liquid He density functional theory to simulate the dynamics during solvation, providing insights into the binding mechanisms and stabilization of solvation structures.

Method: The study employs liquid He time-dependent density functional theory under zero temperature conditions to simulate the pump-probe experiment. It focuses on tracking the solvation dynamics and the energy relaxation processes of the alkali ions within the helium droplet.

Result: The simulations support the Poissonian model for the initial binding of helium atoms around Na⁺ and K⁺. However, the solvation structure is not stable initially and undergoes significant energy relaxation, with a longer time delay and decay time compared to experiments.

Conclusion: The solvation process begins with a turbulent phase where the structure is unstable, and stabilization occurs over a prolonged period due to interactions with the surrounding helium solvent.

Abstract: The solvation process of an alkali ion (Na$^+$, K$^+$, Rb$^+$, Cs$^+$) inside
a superfluid $^4$He$_{2000}$ nanodroplet is investigated theoretically using
liquid $^4$He time-dependent density functional theory at zero temperature. We
simulate both steps of the pump-probe experiment conducted on Na$^+$
[Albrechtsen et al., Nature 623, 319 (2023)], where the alkali atom residing at
the droplet surface is ionized by the pump pulse and its solvation is probed by
ionizing a central xenon atom and detecting the expulsed Na$^+$He$_n$ ions. Our
results confirm the Poissonian model for the binding of the first five He atoms
for the lighter Na$^+$ and K$^+$ alkalis, with a rate in good agreement with
the more recent experimental results on Na$^+$ [Albrechtsen et al., J. Chem.
Phys. 162, 174309 (2025)]. For the probe step we show that the ion takes
several picoseconds to get out of the droplet. During this rather long time,
the solvation structure around it is very hot and far from equilibrium, and it
can gain or lose more He atoms. Surprisingly, analysing the Na$^+$ solvation
structure energy reveals that it is not stable by itself during the first few
picoseconds of the solvation process. After that, energy relaxation follows a
Newton behavior, as found experimentally, but with a longer time delay,
$5.0\leq t_0\leq 6.5$ ps vs. $0.23\pm0.06$ ps, and characteristic decay time,
$7.3\le\tau\le 16.5$ ps vs. $2.6\pm 0.4$ ps. We conclude that the first
instants of the solvation process are highly turbulent and that the solvation
structure is stabilized only by the surrounding helium ``solvent''.

### [2] [Nonlinear phase synchronization and the role of spacing in shell models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14142)

Motivation: 壳模型作为描述复杂系统动力学行为的重要工具，研究其中的非线性振子相位动态及其与间歇性之间的关系具有重要意义。

Method: 文中通过分析三元组非线性振子的相位动态与壳模型中的能量传递机制，应用Kuramoto order parameter评估整体相位协调，利用局域Kuramoto parameter探测burst事件。

Result: 研究结果表明相位协调与能量传递密切相关， helical相互作用影响了间歇性，不同壳模型中维持逆 cascade需要特定相位组织，三角相位的PDF与能量流方向相关。

Conclusion: -shell 模型中的相位动态与能量传递密切相关，相位协调增强能量传递，相位锁定状态与极端能量事件相关，不同壳模型的特性决定了不同能量流动方向的维持需要特定的相位组织。

Abstract: A shell model can be considered as a chain of triads, where each triad can be
interpreted as a nonlinear oscillator that can be mapped to a spinning top.
Investigating the relation between phase dynamics and intermittency in a such a
chain of nonlinear oscillators, it is found that synchronization is linked to
increased energy transfer. In particular, the results provide evidence that the
observed systematic increase of intermittency, as the shell spacing is
decreased, is associated with strong phase alignment among consecutive triadic
phases, facilitating the energy cascade. It is shown that while the overall
level of synchronization can be quantified using a Kuramoto order parameter for
the global phase coherence in the inertial range, a local, weighted Kuramoto
parameter can be used for the detection of burst-like events propagating across
shells in the inertial range. This novel analysis reveals how partially
phase-locked states are associated with the passage of extreme events of energy
flux. Applying this method to helical shell models, reveals that for a
particular class of helical interactions, a reduction in phase coherence
correlates with suppression of intermittency. When inverse cascade scenarios
are considered using two different shell models including a non local helical
shell model, and a local standard shell model with a modified conservation law,
it was shown that a particular phase organization is needed in order to sustain
the inverse energy cascade. It was also observed that the PDFs of the triadic
phases were peaked in accordance with the basic considerations of the form of
the flux, which suggests that a triadic phase of \pi/2 and -\pi/2 maximizes the
forward and the inverse energy cascades respectively.

### [3] [Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14373)
*Nadav Shaibe,Jared M. Erb,Steven M. Anlage*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper discusses the statistical properties and significance of singularities in wave functions, particularly in scattering systems, emphasizing their ubiquity and impact on system behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to explore the role of singularities in various wave phenomena and their statistical implications in scattering systems.

Method: The authors use mathematical analysis, topological considerations, and empirical experiments (microwave experiments) combined with Random Matrix Theory simulations.

Result: The study finds that singularities, especially CPA, RSMs, TSMs, and EPs, share universal statistical properties with a -3 power-law tail in their distributions. System loss is a key factor affecting singularity density.

Conclusion: All results indicate universal applicability to generic scattering systems, highlighting the importance of singularity density and the role of loss.

Abstract: Vortex singularities and their speckle patterns in random superpositions of
waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are
consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable,
they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise
annihilation. They have found application in optical, acoustic, elastic, and
fluid wave fields, among others. We generalize the concept of singularity
speckle patterns to arbitrary two dimensional parameter spaces and any complex
scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering.
In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities
associated with complex zeros of the scattering matrix S. Some examples are
Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA), Reflectionless Scattering Modes (RSMs),
Transmissionless Scattering Modes (TSMs), and S-matrix Exceptional Points
(EPs). All scattering singularities empirically share a universal statistical
property: the tail of the probability distribution function of a quantity that
diverges only at a singularity has the form of a -3 power law. The heavy tail
of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given
singularity in a generic scattering system. We use these universal statistical
results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important
parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space. Finally,
we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space,
which result in higher order singularities that have new applications. These
higher order singularities are not topologically protected, and we do not find
universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results
from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude
that all results presented are found in all generic scattering systems.

### [4] [Hamiltonian Triplet Interactions: Areal and Perimetric Forces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14762)
*J. D. Meiss*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper discusses a Hamiltonian system with triplet interactions, proposing a new model where forces depend on a triangle's perimeter or area. The system has intriguing dynamics, including both regular and chaotic behaviors, and potential applications in various physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a new approach to multi-body interactions in Hamiltonian systems, which is relevant in various fields of physics and could offer new insights into complex systems like polarizable molecules or colloids.

Method: The authors model the system using potential energy based on triangle geometry, analyze the forces pointing to specific centers, and explore the system's degrees of freedom and possible solutions through numerical simulations.

Result: The system exhibits both regular and chaotic dynamics, with some special solutions, and the findings could be useful in understanding similar systems in different areas of physics.

Conclusion: The proposed triplet interaction model provides a new perspective on multi-body interactions, with potential applications in understanding complex systems by analyzing their geometric and dynamic properties.

Abstract: Gravitational and electromagnetic interactions are Hamiltonian systems with
forces between pairs of particles. We propose an alternative: Hamiltonian
dynamics with triplet interactions between point particles. Our system has a
potential energy that depends on the shape of the triangle for each triplet.
Similar multi-body forces occur in many physical systems, e.g., polarizable
molecules, nucleon interactions, and colloids, but typically are combined with
more conventional two-body forces. We focus on potentials that depend only on
the triangle perimeter or on its area. The resulting forces point towards a
center of the triangle, either the incenter or the orthocenter, respectively.
For the planar case, the resulting system has six degrees of freedom but can be
reduced to three since it conserves the total momentum and angular momentum.
The dynamics often exhibits chaotic motion, but there are a number of special
solutions, for example equilateral and isosceles triangles, and perturbations
of these can lie on invariant tori. Numerical investigations of several
examples show families of such regular trajectories as well as examples of
chaotic dynamics.

### [5] [Nuclear-spin-related properties of~the dual-frequency Doppler-free resonance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14659)
*E. A. Tsygankov,K. M. Sabakar,D. S. Chuchelov,M. I. Vaskovskaya,V. V. Vassiliev,S. A. Zibrov,V. L. Velichansky*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: 该研究探索了碱金属原子D1线的双频Doppler自由共振现象，针对任意可获得的核自旋I值，利用电荷操作符的对称性和基态性质，讨论了不同偏振情况下的现象。结果显示，平行偏振状态下中心处的共振线宽最窄，而垂直偏振状态下中心处的吸收增强且线宽减小。实验结果与理论分析一致。

Method: 通过基于电荷操作符的对称性和基态性质的理论分析，结合实验结果，探讨不同偏振条件下的现象。

Result: 实验结果与理论分析一致，显示了不同I值下的共振特性。

Conclusion: 研究为精确时间keeping和原子钟的应用提供了理论支持和实验验证。

Abstract: We investigate the dual-frequency Doppler-free resonance in the D1 line of
alkali-metal atoms for any accessible value of the nuclear spin I. The
consideration is performed using the symmetries of the dipole operator and the
basis, where the quantization axis is directed along the polarization of the
one of optical waves. We show that there is the absence of the optical pumping
in the scheme with parallel polarizations for the center of the crossover,
resulting in its smallest width. Secondly, the growth in the absorption for the
center of the peak with Fe=I-1/2 and the decrease of its width with the
two-photon detuning in the case of~orthogonal polarizations is explained.
Particular attention is paid to the special case of I=3/2, where this effect is
the most pronounced. The experiment with 87Rb, 85Rb, and 133Cs atoms is in
agreement with the analysis.

Conclusion: 研究结果验证了有限温度下的量子电动力学与量子力学的一致性，为原子物理和高精度光谱实验提供了重要理论依据。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the one-loop
self-energy correction at finite temperature for the bound electron. In this
approach, we study the influence of thermal radiation on atomic systems. Along
the way, we found well-known effects, including thermal Stark and Zeeman
shifts, as well as thermal quadrupole interactions and relativistic corrections
to the multipole expansion of photon field operators. We show that the
corresponding contributions arise from the decomposition of the fully
relativistic expression in terms of the $\alpha Z$ parameter. The presented
analysis unambiguously determines the consistency of the quantum
electrodynamics theory at finite temperature (TQED) with the perturbation
theory of quantum mechanics (QM). Although our analysis mainly focuses on the
hydrogen atom model, their potential implications for precision spectroscopic
experiments are discussed.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用商用水Carol镜头的高数值光密和长前工作距离成像方法，设计了一个通过单组设计实现光束聚焦并减少通过镜片损坏的效率，实验结果在375-866纳米波长范围内实现了单色分辨率极限，FOV在540微米内。

Motivation: 在科学实验中，高数值光密和长前工作距离成像对研究高精度和量子现象探索至关重要，因此寻找一种无需复杂调整即可高效实现的解决方案具有重要意义。

Method: 论文采用了一种基于商用水Carol镜头的光学设计方法，通过精确调整使得光束直接聚焦，避免了传统分步聚焦的复杂性，同时-white了其他常规参数如焦距和光密，并通过实验验证了设计的可行性。

Result: 使用商用水Carol镜头，该 objective 达到0.87微米分辨率，并在46微米的视野范围内保持了分析波长范围内的稳定性能。

Conclusion: 该设计为科学研究提供了一种高效、 Affordable、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a robust objective lens optimized for applications requiring both
high numerical aperture (NA) and long front working distance imaging comprised
of all commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) singlet lenses. Unlike traditional
designs that require separate collimation and refocusing stages, our approach
directly converges imaged light to the back focal plane using a single lens
group. Our configuration corrects spherical aberrations and efficiently
collects light to achieve diffraction-limited performance across a wide range
of wavelengths while simplifying alignment and assembly. Using this approach,
we design and construct an example objective lens that features a long front
working distance of 61 mm and a clipped NA of 0.30 (limited by an aperture in
our experimental setup). We experimentally verify that it achieves
monochromatic diffraction-limited resolution at wavelengths from 375 nm to 866
nm without requiring replacement of the lenses or changing the inter-lens
spacings, and its performance remains robust across a 46 mm range variation in
total length (by adjusting mainly the back working distances). Additionally, we
develop a quantitative method to measure the field of view (FOV) using an
experimentally-calibrated pinhole target. Under 397 nm illumination (i.e. from
$^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion fluorescence), the objective achieves a resolution of 0.87
$\mu$m with a 540 $\mu$m FOV. This robust, all-COTS, and versatile design is
well-suited for a broad range of experiments, supporting high-precision
measurements and exploring quantum phenomena.

*Adrian Ehrenhofer,Thomas Wallmersperger,Gianaurelio Cuniberti*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 摘要探讨了大型语言模型在机械工程和材料科学中的应用，指出现有LLM难以处理科学数据，建议通过构建专门的材料知识库来提升应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在材料科学中的应用日益广泛，构建可靠的材料知识库对于工程应用至关重要。

Method: 利用大型语言模型处理材料科学数据，比较不同模型的生成效果。

Result: 发现现有LLM在科学准确性上有不足，构建材料知识库有助于提高应用效果。

Conclusion: 建议开发专门针对材料科学的LLM，以确保生成的材料数据的正确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in the fields of
mechanical engineering and materials science. As models that establish
connections through the interface of language, LLMs can be applied for
step-wise reasoning through the Processing-Structure-Property-Performance chain
of material science and engineering. Current LLMs are built for adequately
representing a dataset, which is the most part of the accessible internet.
However, the internet mostly contains non-scientific content. If LLMs should be
applied for engineering purposes, it is valuable to investigate models for
their intrinsic knowledge -- here: the capacity to generate correct information
about materials. In the current work, for the example of the Periodic Table of
Elements, we highlight the role of vocabulary and tokenization for the
uniqueness of material fingerprints, and the LLMs' capabilities of generating
factually correct output of different state-of-the-art open models. This leads
to a material knowledge benchmark for an informed choice, for which steps in
the PSPP chain LLMs are applicable, and where specialized models are required.

*Graeme W. Milton*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper points out that Brambilla et al.'s claim of discovering a new pentamode design is incorrect, noting that a similar design was previously developed. This clarifies that the innovation was not novel as initially thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the novelty of the design and provide a proper context by critiquing Brambilla et al.'s work based on prior research.

Method: The analysis references prior research from 2016 where a similar pentamode design was published, showing that Brambilla et al.'s work was an extension or application of earlier findings.

Result: The critique concludes that the design was not novel, thus supporting the original assertion that Brambilla et al. misattribution or incorrect attribution of the design's origin.

Conclusion: The paper's conclusion likely addresses the importance of acknowledging prior work and corrects the attribution of the pentamode design to avoid misinformation in the field.

Abstract: We bring attention to the fact that the claim of Brambilla et.al. [Extreme
Mechanics Letters 74 (2025) 102267; arXiv:2406.14502] of discovering a novel
design for pentamode materials is incorrect. Back in 2016 Briane, Harutyunyan

Abstract: Acoustic black hole (ABH) structure has been extensively employed in
applications such as vibration mitigation, noise reduction, and energy
harvesting, owing to its unique sound wave trapping and energy concentration
effects. Furthermore, ABH structure shows significant promise in improving the
performance of ultrasonic device and constructing multifunc-tional acoustic
field. Therefore, this paper proposes an ultrasonic mode-conversion transducer
consisting of a Langevin transducer and an ABH wedge radiant plate to
investigate the potential applications of ABH in ultrasonic levitation and
multifunctional particle manipulation. The theoretical model of flexural
vibration of the radiant plate is established by utilizing Timoshenko beam
theory and transfer matrix method, and the calculated vibration frequencies
demonstrated good agreement with those obtained from finite element simulations
(FES). The electrical impedance frequency response characteristics, vibration
modes and the near-field sound pressure distribution of the transducer in air
were also simulated. The results revealed that the amplitude of the ABH wedge
radiant plate increases stepwise, and the sound pressure exhibits a gradient
distribution. A prototype of the transducer was fabricated and experimentally
tested, confirming the accuracy of FES and the feasibility of the design
approach. Finally, the ultrasonic levitation experiment demonstrated that the
ABH design enables the formation of gradient distribution of sound pressure in
the standing wave sound field, thereby facilitating precise particle sorting.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of compact and low-noise terahertz detectors based on TeraFETs. They achieved a significant improvement in sensitivity and demonstrated low noise-equivalent power even without helium cooling. The system was tested with a high dynamic range and wide detection bandwidth, making it suitable for space applications where cryogenic cooling isn't feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve terahertz radiation detection, especially in space-constrained environments where traditional cooling methods are impractical, using TeraFETs as the detector material.

Method: The paper presents a detailed methodology including the development of an 8x8 detector array, measurement of temperature effects on detector noise, and projection of NEP values. They used liquid nitrogen cooling for the system and tested it with a quantum-cascade laser source.

Result: The system achieved a dynamic range exceeding 67 dB and wide detection bandwidth, offering superior sensitivity without requiring helium cooling. NEP projections showed it comparable to advanced thermal detectors when operated at lower temperatures.

Conclusion: The developed system represents a significant advancement in terahertz detection, enabling applications in space missions without the need for helium cooling, and potentially outperforming traditional detectors in compact and low-noise designs.

Abstract: The sensitivity of antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) to
terahertz (THz) radiation has been shown to improve continuously with
decreasing temperature. In this work, we first present a quantitative
evaluation of the temperature-dependent noise-equivalent power (NEP) of
recently developed patch-antenna-coupled TeraFET detectors resonant at 540 GHz,
with measurements down to 20 K. Based on these results, we project NEP values
approaching 1 to 2 pW/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ under efficient power
coupling-comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting niobium transition-edge
sensors (TESs) operated at 4 K. Building on these findings in the sub-1 THz
range, a compact, low-noise, liquid-nitrogen-cooled (77 K) TeraFET power
detection system for spectroscopy applications was realized. The system
incorporates an 8$\times$8 pixel-binned detector array fabricated in a
commercial 65 nm Si-CMOS process, optimized for operation in the 2.85- to 3.4
THz band, where fast, sensitive and spectrally specific detectors that do not
require helium cooling remain scarce. Final system characterization was
performed in the focal plane of a 2.85-THz quantum-cascade laser delivering
approximately 2 mW of optical power. An experimental linear dynamic range
exceeding 67 dB was achieved without saturation (for 1 Hz-detection bandwidth).
The system provides a -3 dB detection bandwidth of 5 MHz vastly exceeding that
of conventional thermal detectors (typically 1-kHz), thus potentially enabling
advanced applications such as time-resolved THz spectroscopy down to the
sub-$\mu$s scale. Combined with its broad temperature operability and compact
design, the system is particularly well suited for space- and
payload-constrained platforms such as balloon- and satellite-based missions,
where deep cryogenic cooling is impractical.

### [13] [Hyperelastic nature of the Hoek-Brown criterion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15813)
*Ilaria Fontana,Goustan Bacquaert,Daniele A. Di Pietro,Kyrylo Kazymyrenko*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: A nonlinear elasto-plastic model is introduced that links hyperbolic elasticity to yield criteria, with simulations showing its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper proposes a novel elasto-plastic model aiming to better capture material behavior under various loading conditions, using hyperbolic elasticity and specific yield criteria.

Method: The authors developed a model that combines nonlinear elasticity with plasticity, using the associated flow rule. They derived hyperbolic elasticity from yield criterion invariance and found a quadratic relationship between yield criteria in stress space. Computations were done using finite element methods with cyclic loading simulations.

Result: The model shows dilatancy saturation in cyclic tests, and simulations confirm its applicability for structural analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a new approach for accurate elasto-plastic modeling, particularly useful in structural engineering applications where cyclic loading is a consideration.

Abstract: We propose a nonlinear elasto-plastic model, for which a specific class of
hyperbolic elasticity arises as a straight consequence of the yield criterion
invariance on the plasticity level. We superimpose this nonlinear elastic (or
hyperelastic) behavior with plasticity obeying the associated flow rule.
Interestingly, we find that a linear yield criterion on the thermodynamical
force associated with plasticity results in a quadratic yield criterion in the
stress space. This suggests a specific hyperelastic connection between
Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown (or alternatively between Drucker-Prager and
Pan-Hudson) yield criteria. We compare the elasto-plastic responses of standard
tests for the Drucker-Prager yield criterion using either linear or the
suggested hyperbolic elasticity. Notably, the nonlinear case stands out due to

Abstract: The statistics of local measurements of joint quantum systems can sometimes
be used to distinguish the temporal order in which they were measured. We first
prove that every bipartite separable density matrix is temporally compatible
with direct causal influence for arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum systems
and measurements of a tomographically-complete class of observables, which
includes all Pauli observables in the case of multi-qubit systems.
Equivalently, if a bipartite density matrix is not temporally compatible with
direct causal influence, then it must be entangled. We also provide an
operational meaning for the temporal evolution consistent with such
correlations in terms of a generalized dephasing channel and a pretty good
measurement. The two temporal evolutions turn out to not be Petz recovery maps
of each other, but are Bayesian inverses of each other. Finally, we prove
necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary bipartite quantum state to
be temporally compatible, thereby providing a temporal analogue of the positive
partial transpose criterion valid for quantum systems of any dimension.

### [15] [Polar Codes for Erasure and Unital Classical-Quantum Markovian Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14323)
*Jaswanthi Mandalapu,Vikesh Siddhu,Krishna Jagannathan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Arıkan-constructed polar codes achieve the classical capacity for two noise models in classical-quantum channels with memory. The result relies on existing classical polar coding guarantees for Markov processes and recent findings about no entanglement requirement for classical capacity. More broadly, it shows that classical coding strategies can approach capacity for certain channel types with memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study likely aims to validate the effectiveness of polar codes in handling memory in quantum channels, particularly in noisy environments like qubit erasures and unital noise, which are common in quantum communication settings.

Method: The method involves leveraging existing polar coding results for Markov processes and recent advancements about no entanglement requirement for classical capacity. The analysis incorporates these to conclude the achieved capacity.

Result: Polar codes achieve classical capacity for two noise models with memory in cq-channels.

Conclusion: Polar codes are effective for classical capacity in channels with qubit erasures and unital noise, even with memory.

Abstract: We consider classical-quantum (cq-)channels with memory, and establish that
Ar{\i}kan-constructed polar codes achieve the classical capacity for two key
noise models, namely for (i) qubit erasures and (ii) unital qubit noise with
channel state information at the receiver. The memory in the channel is assumed
to be governed by a discrete-time, countable-state, aperiodic, irreducible, and
positive recurrent Markov process. We establish this result by leveraging
existing classical polar coding guarantees established for finite-state,
aperiodic, and irreducible Markov processes [FAIM], alongside the recent
finding that no entanglement is required to achieve the capacity of Markovian
unital and erasure quantum channels when transmitting classical information.
More broadly, our work illustrates that for cq-channels with memory, where an
optimal coding strategy is essentially classical, polar codes can be shown to
approach the capacity.

Abstract: Accurately solving the Schr\"odinger equation remains a central challenge in
computational physics, chemistry, and materials science. Here, we propose an
alternative eigenvalue problem based on a system's autocorrelation function,
avoiding direct reference to a wave function. In particular, we develop a
rigorous approximation framework that enables precise frequency estimation from
a finite number of signal samples. Our analysis builds on new results involving
prolate spheroidal wave functions and yields error bounds that reveal a sharp
accuracy transition governed by the observation time and spectral density of
the signal. These results are very general and thus carry far. As one important
example application we consider the quantum computation for molecular systems.
By combining our spectral method with a quantum subroutine for signal
generation, we define quantum prolate diagonalization (QPD) - a hybrid
classical-quantum algorithm. QPD simultaneously estimates ground and excited
state energies within chemical accuracy at the Heisenberg limit. An analysis of
different input states demonstrates the robustness of the method, showing that
high precision can be retained even under imperfect state preparation.

Abstract: Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known
ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic
structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial
optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded,
retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic
structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from
reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed
exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this
structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as
killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase
this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial
relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable,
ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to
explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how
Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.

TL;DR: This paper explores permutations within the Clifford Hierarchy, specifically focusing on 4-qubit gates. By linking to cryptography results and diagonal gates, they demonstrate all 4-qubit gates in the third level are semi-Clifford. They also introduce cycle structures and classify them up to affine equivalence, which is a key contribution. The classification applies broadly beyond qubits.uthority

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets quantum computing, focusing on structures within the Clifford Hierarchy, which are important for error correction and stabilizer codes. By connecting permutations to cryptography and diagonal gates, they likely aim to understand gate synthesis and circuit design better.

Method: The authors used affine equivalence from cryptography literature, classified 4-qubit permutations, leveraged previous diagonal gate results, and introduced cycle structures to characterize gates within the hierarchy.

Result: They successfully proved that all 4-qubit gates in the third level are semi-Clifford and established a classification for small cycle structures up to affine equivalence.

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding of Clifford Hierarchy structures, with practical implications for quantum circuit synthesis and error correction, especially for 4-qubit systems.

Abstract: In this paper we prove a collection of results on the structure of
permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy. First, we leverage results from the
cryptography literature on affine equivalence classes of 4-bit permutations
which we use to find all 4-qubit permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy. We
then use the classification of 4-qubit permutations and previous results on the
structure of diagonal gates in the Clifford Hierarchy to prove that all 4-qubit
gates in the third level of the Clifford Hierarchy are semi-Clifford. Finally,
we introduce the formalism of cycle structures to permutations in the Clifford
Hierarchy and prove a general structure theorem about them. We also classify
many small cycle structures up to affine equivalence. Interestingly, this
classification is independent of the number of qubits.

Result: 论文发现了双态系统，当光导线长度满足特定比例时，能量层次可以接近相重叠。

Conclusion: 该研究成果可用于设计高效量子信息处理装置。

Abstract: The physics of systems of quantum emitters is significantly influenced by the
relation between their spatial separation and the wavelength of the emitted
photons. If the distance that separates a pair of emitters meets specific
resonance conditions, the photons produced from decay may destructively
interfere. In an infinite-wavelength setting, this effect gives rise to bound
states in the continuum, where a photon remains confined in between the
emitter. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with two periodic boundary
conditions, the relevant distances become two, leading to states in which a
photon is confined in either the shorter or the longer path that connects the
emitters. If the ratio of the shorter and the longer path is a rational number,
these two kinds of resonant states are allowed to co-exist in the same
Hamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the existence of quasi-degenerate
resonant doublets of a pair of identical emitters coupled to a linear waveguide
mode. The states that form the doublet are searched among the ones in which a
single excitation tends to remain bound to the emitters. We investigate the
spectrum in a finite range around degeneracy points to check whether the
doublet remains well separated from the closest eigenvalues in the spectrum.
The identification of quasi-degenerate doublets opens the possibility to
manipulate the emitters-waveguide system as an effectively two-level system in
specific energy ranges, providing an innovative tool for quantum technology
tasks.

Result: Injecting noise and using QEC improve noise suppression and allow detection of suspicious noise profiles.

Conclusion: QI-Nutshell provides a practical framework for testing quantum communication security using ion-trap computers, utilizing QEC for privacy authentication without altering quantum information.

Abstract: Quantum Internet in a Nutshell (QI-Nutshell) connects the fields of quantum
communication and quantum computing by emulating quantum communication
protocols on currently available ion-trap quantum computers. We demonstrate
emulations of QKD protocols where the individual steps are mapped to physical
operations within our hardware platform. This allows us to not only practically
execute established protocols such as BB84 or BBM92, but also include cloning
attacks by an eavesdropping party, noise sources and side-channel attacks that
are generally hard to include in theoretical QKD security proofs. We
deliberately inject noise and investigate its effect on quantum communication
protocols. We employ numerical simulations in order to study the incorporation
of small quantum error correction (QEC) codes into QKD protocols. We find that
these codes can help to suppress the noise level and to monitor the noise
profile of the channel. This may enable the communicating parties to detect
suspicious deviations from expected noise characteristics as a result of
potential eavesdropping. This suggests that QEC may serve as a means of privacy
authentication for quantum communication without altering the transmitted
quantum information.

Abstract: In this work, we examine the physical process of stimulated emission as a
model for state-dependent quantum copying. We explore how a quantum state, for
instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter
interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, effectively
encodes prior information about the quantum state. This process, while
resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its
state-dependent and non-universal nature. We clarify the distinction between
universal cloning and conditional copying, and demonstrate that stimulated
emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum
copying.

*Dhiman Bhowmick,Wen Wei Ho*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study reveals the origin of the Granovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar state in XYZ spin chains using modern quantum many-body scar concepts. It identifies applicability limits of standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA) frameworks and introduces alternative methods like approximated SGA and generalized SGA. The research also explores the possibility of constructing lattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional systems, finding restrictions based on lattice structure and symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from the surprising discovery of a scar state with zero entanglement and long periodicity in spin chains, dating back to nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became prominent. It provides a valuable contribution to the field of quantum scars, which studies how quantum systems can retain memory of classical chaos through rare, robust states.

Method: The study uses a combination of theoretical analysis and group-theoretical methods to uncover the origin of the GZ scar. It examines the role of quasi-U(1) symmetry within the scar subspace under the XXZ limit and develops alternative techniques, such as approximated and generalized SGA, for higher generality. Additionally, the researchers employ graphical rules for GZ scar construction, exploring different lattice structures.

Result: The main findings include the applicability of standard SGA in the XXZ limit with quasi-U(1) symmetry, the need for alternative methods in XYZ systems without such symmetry, and the boundaries for constructing lattice-independent GZ scars, particularly regarding evenness in coordination numbers and edge counts. The results also suggest that breaking spatial uniformity through certain bond symmetries can bypass some of these boundaries.

Conclusion: The work broadens the understanding of GBM scars by linking it to group theory and graph methods. It provides new methods to construct and verify many-body scars, contributing to the theoretical framework while broadening the known platforms for studying such states. The study advocates for future work in higher-dimensional systems and with non-uniform lattices to understand the emergence of lattice-independent scars.

Abstract: In a work by Granovskii and Zhedanov, a surprising scar state exhibiting zero
entanglement and long periodicity was discovered in the XYZ spin chains;
remarkably, nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became a
subject of active research. In this study, we uncover the origin of the
Granovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding
of quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be
effectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA)
framework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This
description, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$
symmetry exists within the scar subspace. In contrast, the absence of such
quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry for the GZ scar subspace restricts the applicability of
these standard formulations. We propose two alternative techniques:
approximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar
subspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar
subspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing
lattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange
systems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar
construction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be
supported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with
an odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination
numbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in
specific scenarios. Remarkably, if certain bonds retain the full $SU(2)$
symmetry of the spin-exchange interaction, thereby breaking the spatial
uniformity of the lattice, lattice-independent GZ scars can still emerge in
systems with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of
edges.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Superconducting microwave resonators' Fano asymmetry can be eliminated using a symmetry analysis based on common mode excitation eigenvalues. This approach reduces uncertainty and enhances measurement throughput by a factor of 25.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses Fano asymmetry in superconducting microwave resonators, which complicates the measurement of low-power devices. The proposed method using common mode excitation simplifies analysis and improves measurement precision.

Method: The method involves analyzing common mode excitation eigenvalues and utilizing a 3D aluminum cavity model to calibrate measurements, achieving quantitative agreement between hanger mode and ERM measurements.

Result: A five-fold reduction in measurement uncertainty is achieved by incorporating ERM data, demonstrating a significant enhancement in measurement accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach enables more efficient and accurate measurements of low-power superconducting resonators, with potential applications in quantum device characterization.

Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators are used to study two-level system (TLS)
loss in superconducting quantum devices. Fano asymmetry, characterized by a
nonzero asymmetry angle $\phi$ in the diameter correction method (DCM), results
from the coupling schemes used to measure these devices, including the commonly
used hanger method. $\phi$ is an additional fitting parameter which contains no
physically interesting information and can obscure device parameters of
interest. The tee-junction symmetry nominally present in these resonator
devices provides an avenue for the elimination of Fano asymmetry using
calibrated measurement. We show that the eigenvalue associated with the common
mode excitation of the resonator is an effective reflection mode (ERM) which
has no Fano asymmetry. Our analysis reveals the cause of Fano asymmetry as
interference between common and differential modes. Practically, we obtain the
ERM from a linear combination of calibrated reflection and transmission
measurements. We utilize a 3D aluminum cavity to experimentally demonstrate the
validity and flexibility of this model. To extend the usefulness of this
symmetry analysis, we apply perturbation theory to recover the ERM in a
multiplexed coplanar waveguide resonator device and experimentally demonstrate
quantitative agreement in the extracted $Q_i^{-1}$ between hanger mode and ERM
measurements. We observe a five-fold reduction in uncertainty from the ERM
compared to the standard hanger mode at the lowest measured power, -160 dBm
delivered to the device. This method could facilitate an increase in throughput
of low-power superconducting resonator measurements by up to a factor of 25, as
well as allow the extraction of critical parameters from otherwise unfittable
device data.

Result: 实现了99%的读出成功率，显著改善了读出器的性能。

Conclusion: 通过调节偏移和锁相环，可以有效避免状态转移影响，提升超导电路的测量精度和速度。

Abstract: State transitions during qubit measurements are extremely detrimental to
quantum tasks that rely on repeated measurements, such as quantum error
correction. These state transitions can occur when excessive measurement power
leads to qubit excitations outside its computational space. Alternatively, the
qubit state can decay rapidly when the measurement protocol inadvertently
couples the qubit to lossy modes such as two-level systems (TLSs). We
experimentally verify the impact of these TLSs in qubit readout by measuring
the transition errors at different qubit flux bias. Because such state
transitions during measurements are often localized in frequency space, we
demonstrate the ability to avoid them during a fluxonium readout by exploiting
the qubit's flux-tunability. By synchronizing the flux bias with the readout
photon dynamics, we obtain an optimal readout fidelity of 99 % (98.4 %) in 1 us
(0.5 us) integration time. Our work advances the understanding of state
transitions in superconducting circuit measurements and demonstrates the
potential of fluxonium qubits to achieve fast high-fidelity readout.

Conclusion: 多部分量子纠缠是一种有效且强大的工具，能够改进现有方法用于识别1+1维系统的临界点。未来工作可能扩展到更高维或更复杂系统。

Abstract: We show that multipartite entanglement can be used as an efficient way of
identifying the critical points of 1+1D systems. We demonstrate this with the
quantum Ising model, lattice $\lambda \phi^4$ approximated with qutrits, and
arrays of Rydberg atoms. To do so we make use of multipartite compositions of
entanglement quantities for different parts combined to form the strong
subadditivity, weak monotonicity, and a convex combination of these with
conformal properties. These quantities display some remarkable properties. We
will demonstrate how the entanglement of individual parts together displays
behavior at phase boundaries, but the combination of these in the
aforementioned quantities sharpens and localizes this behavior to the
boundaries even better. We will show that we can extend a scheme for
approximating the entanglement with the mutual information, and that this acts
as a lower bound which will also follow the changes in the entanglement for the
above quantities, despite the additional contributions of different signs. This
mutual information approximation to the identifying quantities can have its
lower probabilities removed in a process we call filtering, and despite the
combination of terms will respond well to the filtering and offer improvements
to the lower bound.

### [27] [High-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation using phase-matched spectral islands in a zero-added-loss multiplexing architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14427)
*Jeffrey H. Shapiro,Clark Embleton,Michael G. Raymer,Brian J. Smith*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper describes an improved scheme for spectral multiplexing enabling high-fidelity, high-rate entanglement generation, which can support a quantum internet. Chen et al.'s ZALM required many spectral channels, while the modified ZALM uses fewer channels by using same-island and cross-island heralding, allowing scaling to a high number of channels. This advancement could lead to practical implementations in satellite or fiber networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of scaling up entanglement distribution rates beyond what is currently achievable in quantum internet applications.

Method: The paper modifies a scheme called ZALM, originally by Chen et al., by applying concepts from Morrison et al. to use phase-matched spectral islands with fewer channels. The method introduces same-island and cross-island heralding to increase the delivery rate and reduce loss sensitivity.

Result: The modified ZALM achieves higher entanglement distribution rates and better fidelity under realistic losses compared to the original ZALM scheme, making it a viable approach for practical quantum internet applications.

Conclusion: The proposed ZALM modification with enhanced heralding techniques offers a scalable solution for high-rate entanglement distribution, which is crucial for the development of a quantum internet.

Abstract: While photonic entanglement generation and distribution are well developed,
their demonstrated rates are far below what is needed for a quantum internet.
The present paper proposes and analyzes a scheme for spectral multiplexing that
provides entanglement-distribution rates well in excess of the state of the
art. It builds on the idea presented by Chen~\emph{et al}.~[Phys. Rev. Appl.
{\bf 19}, 054209 (2023)], who proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) as a
means for high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation.
Unfortunately, Chen \emph{et al}.'s ZALM requires a large number (800) of
spectral channels to achieve its claimed high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic,
high-rate entanglement generation. Our modified version of ZALM affords major
performance improvements over the original. It draws on Morrison~\emph{et
al}.~[APL Photon. {\bf 7}, 066102 (2022)], who domain engineered a $\chi^{(2)}$
crystal to realize a biphoton wave function with 8 discrete and
spectrally-factorable frequency bins. Our ZALM SPDCs each have a modest number
($N_I\ll$ 800) of these phase-matched spectral islands each generating two-mode
squeezed-vacuum states, permitting our analysis, unlike Chen~\emph{et al.}'s,
to account for multipairs of all orders, losses in the partial BSM, and
propagation losses en route to the receivers. A major innovation in our
proposal is to employ both same-island heralding and cross-island heralding,
which allows the entanglement-delivery rate to scale as $N_I^2$ rather than
$N_I$ in the weak squeezing regime required for the reception of photon pairs
with a high Bell-state fidelity under realistic losses. This heralding scheme
uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels, which may enable near-term
implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures.

Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, two-qubit gates in
quantum circuits are more susceptible to noise than single-qubit gates.
Therefore, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is crucial for improving
circuit efficiency and reliability. As quantum circuits scale up, the
optimization search space becomes increasingly complex, leading to challenges
such as low efficiency and suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a quantum circuit optimization approach based on dynamic
grouping and ZX-calculus. First, a random strategy-based dynamic grouping
method partitions the circuit into multiple subcircuits. Second, a ZX-calculus
guided k-step lookahead search performs equivalent subcircuit filtering to
minimize two-qubit gate counts. Third, a delay-aware placement method optimizes
the recombined circuit to reduce the overall gate count. Finally, simulated
annealing iteratively updates the grouping strategy to achieve an optimized
two-qubit gate count. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in reducing two-qubit
gates. Compared to the original circuits, the approach achieves an average
reduction of 18% in two-qubit gates. It outperforms classical methods with up
to 25% reduction, especially on gf circuits, and shows a 4% average improvement
over heuristic ZX-calculus-based methods, validating its efficiency.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Abstract discusses quantum circuits with spatial noise modulation and their impact on purification phase transitions using many-body negativity. Key findings show how modulation affects criticality and phase transitions, relevant to quantum error correction and noise management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses quantum noise management, which is crucial for quantum computing's noise resilience. Spatial noise modulation is a novel approach, and purification phase transitions are important for quantum state improvement.

Method: Investigates hybrid random Clifford circuits with spatially non-uniform noise using many-body negativity as an entanglement measure. Analyzes phase transitions to understand the impact of noise on quantum states.

Result: Demonstrates effect of spatial noise modulation on phase transitions, showing change in critical exponents. Indicates potential for better noise management strategies in quantum systems.

Conclusion: Proposal could enhance quantum error correction by managing noise through spatial modulation, offering new insights into quantum state purification.

Abstract: Noise is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. It arises randomly in
space. Inspired by spatial non-uniformity of the noise, we investigate the
effects of spatial modulation on purification phase transitions in a hybrid
random Clifford circuit. As an efficient observable for extracting quantum
entanglement in mixed states, we employ many-body negativity. The behavior of
the many-body negativity well characterizes the presence of the purification
phase transitions and its criticality. We find the effect of spatial
non-uniformity in measurement probability on purification phase transition. The
criticality of the purification phase transition changes from that of uniform
probability, which is elucidated from the argument of the Harris criterion. The
critical correlation length exponent $\nu$ changes from $\nu < 2$ for uniform
probability to $\nu > 2$ for spatially modulated probability. We further
investigate a setting where two-site random Clifford gate becomes spatially
(quasi-)modulated. We find that the modulation induces a phase transition,
leading to a different pure phase where a short-range quantum entanglement
remains.

Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a fundamental task in quantum computing and
quantum information processing. With the rapid advancement of quantum
technologies, efficient quantum state preparation has become increasingly
important. This paper proposes a novel approach for quantum state preparation
based on the Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagram (LimTDD). LimTDD
combines the advantages of tensor networks and decision diagrams, enabling

state-of-the-art quantum state preparation method, LimTDD demonstrates
substantial improvements in efficiency when dealing with complex quantum

indicate that, in the best-case scenario, our method can achieve exponential
efficiency gains over existing methods. This study not only highlights the
potential of LimTDD in quantum state preparation but also provides a robust

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to mitigate spectator-induced leakage in quantum computing. By reshaping the Hamiltonian with a tunable coupler, they confine gate dynamics to a two-dimensional subspace, reducing leakage to 1e-4. This approach scales well with more spectators, making it useful for fault-tolerant quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing faces challenges with leakage, particularly in multi-qubit processors where frequency collisions are common. This paper addresses this by introducing a technique that reshapes the Hamiltonian to mitigate leakage, which is essential for scalability and scalability in fault-tolerant computing.

Method: The method involves using a tunable coupler to enforce a block-diagonal Hamiltonian structure. This confines the gate dynamics to a two-dimensional subspace, preventing leakage. Experiments show this works effectively even with multiple spectators and scales well.

Result: Experiments on a superconducting processor demonstrate leakage suppression to 1e-4 across various detunings. With up to three spectators, leakage remains below relevant error correction thresholds.

Conclusion: This dynamic Hamiltonian engineering approach provides a solution to the challenge of leakage in quantum computing, supporting feasible quantum operation and scalability for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Spectator-induced leakage poses a fundamental challenge to scalable quantum
computing, particularly as frequency collisions become unavoidable in
multi-qubit processors. We introduce a leakage mitigation strategy based on
dynamically reshaping the system Hamiltonian. Our technique utilizes a tunable
coupler to enforce a block-diagonal structure on the effective Hamiltonian
governing near-resonant spectator interactions, confining the gate dynamics to
a two-dimensional invariant subspace and thus preventing leakage by
construction. On a multi-qubit superconducting processor, we experimentally
demonstrate that this dynamic control scheme suppresses leakage rates to the
order of $10^{-4}$ across a wide near-resonant detuning range. The method also
scales effectively with the number of spectators. With three simultaneous
spectators, the total leakage remains below the threshold relevant for surface
code error correction. This approach eases the tension between dense frequency
packing and high-fidelity gate operation, establishing dynamic Hamiltonian
engineering as an essential tool for advancing fault-tolerant quantum
computing.

Abstract: Quantum sensing has seen rapid progress from laboratory research to
real-world applications. Solid-state spin systems, particularly
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, are attractive for their ability to
operate at room temperature with high sensitivity. However, electron spin
coherence due to noise from the surrounding spin bath and this environment
effect limits the sensitivity of NV centers. Thus, a critical task in NV
center-based quantum sensing is sensitivity enhancement through coherence
protection. Nuclear spin assisted protocols have demonstrated greater
enhancement of electron spin coherence due to the naturally occurring electron
and nuclear spin pair. The longer nuclear coherence times allow for long-lived
memory bit for quantum information protocols. This review discusses the physics
of NV centers, the mechanisms and variations of nuclear spin-assisted
protocols, and their applications in nuclear spin spectroscopy, atomic imaging,
and magnetic sensing. Challenges in sensitivity enhancement, commercialization
prospects, and future research directions are also explored.

### [33] [Subradiance generation in a chain of two-level atoms with a single excitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14663)
*Nicola Piovella*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates subradiance in a chain of N two-level atoms in the single excitation regime. It studies how subradiance emerges under various initial conditions, including being excited by a weak laser being turned on and off. The authors analyze the dynamics using coupled-dipole equations and evaluate probabilities under generalized Dicke states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of subradiance is important for understanding cooperative effects in quantum systems, which has implications for quantum information processing, Metrology, and Quantum Sensing. This paper bridges the understanding of static properties (eigenvalues) with dynamic behavior (probabilities) to comprehensively grasp subradiance mechanisms.

Method: The authors employ coupled-dipole equations to model the system's dynamics, likely using numerical simulations to solve the equations for N atoms. They also calculate the expectation values of the Hamiltonian on generalized Dicke states and analyze the transition probabilities to these states over time.

Result: The study reveals the conditions under which subradiance occurs, highlighting how initial excitations and external driving (e.g., weak lasers) contribute to the emergence of subradiant eigenmodes. The results show that the probability of the system being in a generalized Dicke state peaks in subradiant regions, confirming the connection between static eigenvalues and dynamic subradiance.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the conditions and mechanisms behind subradiance. By combining static and dynamic analyses, it offers a framework for predicting and observing subradiant behavior in systems with ordered atoms, which is valuable for future experimental studies in quantum physics and applications.

Abstract: Studies of subradiance in a chain N two-level atoms in the single excitation
regime focused mainly on the complex spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian,
identifying subradiant eigenvalues. This can be achieved by finding the
eigenvalues $N$ of the Hamiltonian or by evaluating the expectation value of
the Hamiltonian on a generalized Dicke state, depending on a continuous
variable k. This has the advantage that the sum above N can be calculated
exactly, such that N becomes a simple parameter of the system and no more the
size of the Hilbert space. However, the question remains how subradiance
emerges from atoms initially excited or driven by a laser. Here we study the
dynamics of the system, solving the coupled-dipole equations for N atoms and
evaluating the probability to be in a generalized Dicke state at a given time.
Once the subradiant regions has been identified, it is simple to see if
subradiance is being generated. We discuss different initial excitation
conditions that lead to subradiance and the case of atoms excited by switching
on and off a weak laser. This may be relevant for future experiments aimed at
detecting subradiance in ordered systems.

then progress to an examination of the recent theoretical advancements and the
ingenious extended versions of the experiment. The recent versions seem to
imply that it is no more possible to consider events as absolute.

*Guanyu Zhu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantum LDPC code that surpasses the √N distance barrier by using a homological product and Freedman-Hastings mapping, enabling fault-tolerant CCZ magic state computation and inspiring new manifold discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses long-standing distance barriers in quantum LDPC codes and their applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: The method employs a combination of homological product of qLDPC codes, Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping, cup product, and Freedman’s.times., 

Result: They achieve an Ω(N^{2/3}) distance and use Θ(N^{2/3}) logical qubits, supporting fault-tolerant CCZ magic states.

Conclusion: The work breaks the √N barrier and introduces new 3q-manifolds with unique properties.

Abstract: Historically, a $\sqrt{N}log^{1/2}(N)$ distance barrier for quantum
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with $N$ qubits persisted for nearly two
decades, until the recent discovery of the fibre-bundle code. An open question
is whether such a distance barrier can be broken while preserving the ability
to perform transversal non-Clifford gates. In this direction, another
long-standing distance barrier of $N^{1/3}$ for LDPC stabilizer codes --
present since the discovery of the 3D color code -- was only recently overcome
by a construction achieving an $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ distance (arXiv:2501.19375).
The present work further breaks the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier by taking a
homological product of three good qLDPC codes, combined with the
Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping and the triple cup product to
implement transversal CCZ gates. The resulting code achieves an
$\Omega(N^{2/3})$ distance (a linear $X$-distance of $\Theta(N)$) and a
dimension of $\Theta(N^{2/3})$, which enables fault-tolerant preparation of
$\Theta(N^{1/3})$ independent logical CCZ magic states in a single shot,
without distillation (`magic state fountain'). This new quantum code also
inspires the discovery of a family of exotic $3q$-dimensional manifolds
$\mathcal{M}$, which exhibit both a power-law $\mathbb{Z}_2$-($q$,
$2q$)-systolic freedom and $\Theta(vol(\mathcal{M}))$ triple intersection
points of $2q$-dimensional submanifolds.

Result: 实验结果证明通过这种方式构建QPUs可以显著降低资源消耗。

Conclusion: 这种方法为从较小构造更大规模的QPUs提供了模板，有助于提高资源效率。

Abstract: Universal quantum computing requires the ability to perform every unitary
operation, i.e., evolution operator controllability. In view of developing
resource-efficient quantum processing units (QPUs), it is important to
determine how many local controls and qubit-qubit couplings are required for
controllability. Unfortunately, assessing the controllability of large qubit
arrays is a difficult task, due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space
dimension. Here we show that it is sufficient to connect two qubit arrays that
are evolution operator controllable by a single entangling two-qubit gate in
order to obtain a composite qubit array that is evolution operator
controllable. Our proof provides a template to build up modular QPUs from
smaller building blocks with reduced numbers of local controls and couplings.
We illustrate the approach with two examples, consisting of 10, respectively
127 qubits, inspired by IBM quantum processors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds on the idea of phase transitions in quantum systems, particularly focusing on dynamic transitions driven by quantum quenches. It extends this understanding into non-Hermitian systems, which are important for modeling open quantum systems and have applications in quantum sensing and topological physics.

Method: The authors develop a framework that unifies the study of DQPTs using two different formulations: biorthogonal and self-norm non-biorthogonal, for both pure and mixed states. They derive expressions for key quantities such as the Loschmidt amplitude, echo, and rate function. The paper also provides a geometric interpretation of these transitions and explores the topological aspects arising from non-Hermitian quenches under chiral symmetry.

Result: The key results include a universal geometric signature of DQPTs, specifically the orthogonality of two related vectors in a two-dimensional real space, and the emergence of topological characteristics in non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry. These findings establish geometric and topological principles for quantum criticality in open systems, offering new insights into quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative settings.

Conclusion: The paper's findings open new avenues for studying quantum criticality and topology in non-Hermitian open systems, with significant implications for quantum sensing technologies and the broader field of many-body physics.

Abstract: We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions

framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt
echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs:
orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly,
we demonstrate that non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian
Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological
characteristics, unveiling the intrinsic topological nature of DQPTs beyond
conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and
topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with

Abstract: Polarization entanglement is widely used in optical quantum information
processing due to its compatibility with standard optical components. On the
other hand, it is known that polarization entanglement is susceptible to the
loss, more precisely, its transmission rate in a lossy channel is limited by
the scaling of O({\eta}), where {\eta} is a transmittance of the channel. Here,
we experimentally demonstrate that this rate-loss scaling limit can be overcome
by a relatively simple protocol. This is possible by integrating the idea of
the polarizaion-photon-number hybrid entanglement and the single-click
entanglement swapping. We demonstrate square root improvement of the rate-loss
scaling from the conventional approaches and achieve the fidelity of 0.843 for
the distributed polarization entangled photon pairs. This improvement in the
rate-loss scaling is equivalent to that achieved by 1-hop quantum repeater
node. Our result paves a way to build a near-future quantum network and its
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the urgency of ensuring security in the face of quantum computing advancements, specifically targeting blockchains which rely heavily on classical cryptography.

Method: The proposed method involves creating a quantum blockchain protocol that merges elements from two time-entangled quantum blockchain schemes—the GHZ state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph blockchain. The goal is to achieve absolute time-temporal security similar to the GHZ scheme while ensuring scalability and efficiency akin to the quantum hypergraph approach.

Result: The paper concludes that the new protocol successfully achieves the intended security and efficiency features by leveraging quantum states and protocols, thereby addressing the vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper presents a novel quantum blockchain protocol that successfully balances security and practicality by combining aspects of two existing quantum blockchain models.

Abstract: With rapid advancements in quantum computing, it is widely believed that
there will be quantum hardware capable of compromising classical cryptography
and hence, the internet and the current information security infrastructure in
the coming decade. This is mainly due to the operational realizations of
quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical
encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data
structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach
to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security
by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two
conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph
blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum
blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute
security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency
of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain
protocol.

Abstract: For a symmetric $N$-quDit system described by a density matrix $\rho$, we
construct a one-parameter $s$ family $\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_\rho$ of
quasi-probability distributions through generalized Fano multipole operators
and Stratonovich-Weyl kernels. The corresponding phase space is the complex
projective ${C}P^{D-1}=U(D)/U(D-1)\times U(1)$, related to fully symmetric
irreducible representations of the unitary group $U(D)$. For the particular
cases $D=2$ (qubits) and $D=3$ (qutrits), we analyze the phase-space structure
of Schr\"odinger $U(D)$-spin cat (parity adapted coherent) states and we
provide plots of the corresponding Wigner $\mathcal{F}^{(0)}_\rho$ function. We
examine the connection between non-classical behavior and the negativity of the
Wigner function. We also compute the generalized heat kernel relating two
quasi-probability distributions $\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_\rho$ and
$\mathcal{F}^{(s')}_\rho$, with $t=(s'-s)/2$ playing the role of ``time'',
together with their twisted Moyal product in terms of a trikernel. In the
thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$, we recover the usual Gaussian smoothing for
$s'>s$. A diagramatic interpretation of the phase-space construction in terms

Abstract: Traditionally, the characterization of quantum resources has focused on
individual quantum states. Recent literature, however, has increasingly
explored the characterization of resources in multi-states (ordered collections
of states indexed by a varying parameter). In this work, we provide a
unitary-invariant framework to pinpoint imaginarity and coherence in sets of
qubit states: we prove that Bloch vectors must be coplanar to be
imaginarity-free and colinear to be incoherent, yielding exact rank-based tests
of coherence and imaginarity, and closed-form bounds for existing robustness
quantifiers, all based on two-state overlaps only. We also show that the set of
imaginarity-free multi-states is not convex, and that third-order invariants
completely characterize multi-state imaginarity of single-qubits but not of
higher-dimensional systems. As our main technical result, we show that every
Bargmann invariant of single-qubit states is determined (up to conjugation) by
two-state overlaps. Beyond qubits, we give purity and system-agnostic coherence
witnesses from equality constraints on higher-order invariants and connect our
results to practical protocols: characterization of partial distinguishability,
spin-chirality detection, and subchannel discrimination.

Abstract: The determination of the ground and low-lying excited states is critical in
many studies of quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics. Recent
theoretical work proposes a variational quantum eigensolver using ancillary
qubits to generate entanglement in the variational circuits, which avoids
complex ansatz circuits and successive measurements in the previous algorithms.
In this work, we employ the ancilla-entangled variational quantum eigensolver
to simultaneously compute multiple low-lying eigenenergies and eigenstates of
the H2 molecule and three- and five-spin transverse field Ising models (TFIMs)
on a superconducting quantum processor. We obtain the potential energy curves
of H2 and show an indication of antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase
transition in the TFIMs from the average absolute magnetization. Our
experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of simultaneously
determining multiple eigenenergies and eigenstates of many-body systems with
high efficiency and accuracy and with less computational resources.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new detection method using magnetic properties of LBTs enhanced by NV centers in diamond, achieving high sensitivity with detection limits of picomoles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study motivates the use of magnetic detection for improving sensitivity in biological probe LBTs despite their fluorescence challenges.

Method: The method involves using a diamond-based relaxometer with NV centers to measure magnetic responses of LBTs modified with Receptor-Binding Domain, achieving high sensitivity.

Result: The relaxometer detects LBTs down to 25 fmol, and specifically detects ~1 pmol binding between LBTs and SARS-COVID-2 RBD.

Conclusion: This approach offers a robust, biomimetic platform for picomole concentration detection, enhancing LBT-based applications in diagnostics.

Abstract: Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) stand out as a prominent group of fluorescent
probes that are extensively utilized in biological detection. However, research
on LBTs has predominantly emphasized their fluorescence properties, which
frequently compromised by background fluorescence noise. Investigating magnetic
properties could optimize detection methodologies that offer enhanced
sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we measured the response of a
relaxometer based on ensemble nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to
various amounts of LBTs with gadolinium ions, determining the detection limit
of LBTs to be 25 fmol. We then proposed and demonstrated a detection scheme
employing the NV relaxometer to detect specific binding between LBTs and
target. Specifically, we assessed the relaxometer's response to various
concentrations of the interaction between the modified LBTs and
Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-COVID-2 spike protein, with the detection
threshold reaching ~1 pmol. Our research provides a potential application
platform for biomarker detection under picomole concentration by using NV
centers to detect the magnetism of LBTs.

Motivation: 随着非厄米系统在量子计算、超导体、光子学等领域的应用越来越广泛，理解NH系统的动态行为，尤其是退合点附近的现象变得尤为重要。该论文的贡献在于系统性地揭示了EPs的动力学行为和伪Hermiticity下的evolution特性，为NH设备的设计 laid solid foundations。

Method: 论文结合了理论分析和数值模拟，通过引入广义本征态构建伪完备性关系，验证了不同EPs阶数和初始条件下的动态行为。

Result: 研究结果表明，在一些情况下NH系统的evolution可以是非unitary的，甚至显示出多项式增长的行为，这为NH系统的工程应用提供了新的视角。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅补充了现有理论，还为NH设备的开发和EP相关技术的应用提供了理论基础和实验指导。

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) play a vital role in non-Hermitian (NH) systems,
driving unique dynamical phenomena and promising innovative applications.
However, the NH dynamics at EPs remains obscure due to the incomplete
biorthogonal eigenspaces of defective NH Hamiltonians and thus is often
avoided. In this Letter, we systematically establish pseudo-completeness
relations at EPs by employing all available generalized eigenstates, where both
single and multiple arbitrary-order EPs embracing degenerate scenarios are
addressed, to unveil EP dynamics. We reveal that depending on EP order and
initial conditions, the EP dynamics is characterized by a \emph{polynomial
growth over time} of EP eigenstates or their superposition, which will dominate
long-term evolution despite real spectra protected by pseudo-Hermiticity (PH),
or can also become unitary. We further introduce two PH-compliant NH models to
demonstrate these EP dynamics and explore their applications. This work
completes the dynamical investigation of NH physics, offers valuable insights
into nonunitary EP evolution, and further lays the groundwork for engineering
NH devices and exploiting other EP-related technologies.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过调节驱动电压与 emitter 浓度的关系，在微腔 OLED 中诱导恒定态超放射光发射。实验表明，更少的发射器在较低电压下可达到与无微腔控制板相当甚至更高的亮度，同时光谱宽度变窄，颜色更纯。采用这种调控方法可改善微腔 OLED 的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有机发光二极管（OLED）在现代显示技术和节能照明领域具有重要作用。如前所述，传统上认为更高的发射器浓度会提高发光效率，但实际应用中发现这不一定成立，这是因为浓度效应导致的激发效率下降。该研究旨在通过调节驱动电压与发射器浓度的关系，优化微腔 OLED 的性能，实现更高效的发光。

Method: 研究采用微腔 OLED 结构，通过调整驱动电压随发射器浓度变化，诱导其在恒定状态下实现超放射发光。已测试不同发射器数量和驱动电压下的微腔 OLED 效率和光谱特性。结果显示，当发射器数量增加时，若驱动电压适当调整，其亮度并不明显下降，甚至可能超过无微腔情况下的性能，且光谱宽度减窄，颜色更纯。

Result: 研究在微腔 OLED 中实现了通过调整发射器数量和驱动电压，获得更高效的发光性能。实验结果表明，当微腔 OLED 的发射器数量增加到一定范围后，适当降低驱动电压可提高其发光效率。同时，多发射器微腔 OLED 的半宽缩短，表明利用量子相干效应显著提升了颜色纯度。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在微腔 OLED 中通过控制发射器数量及其驱动电压，可显著提高发光效率并延长寿命，同时确保设备运行效率和寿命不受牺牲。这一发现为 next-generation displays 和节能照明提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are central to modern display
technologies and are promising candidates for low-cost energy-efficient
lighting. Their performance is determined by numerous, intricate fabrication
parameters, but not least by the number of emissive molecules N, which provide
sites for electron-hole recombination and photon generation in the diode host
matrix. Counterintuitively, larger concentrations of emitters do not always
lead to brighter or more efficient OLEDs due to concentration quenching of
luminescence meaning that rates of radiative electron-hole recombination can
become severely reduced, negatively impacting charge-to-photon conversion
efficiency. In this work we trigger steady-state superradiant light emission
from a series of Fabry-P\'erot microcavity OLEDs by scaling the operating
voltage of each device with emitter concentration. We demonstrate a collective
enhancement in the luminance of a microcavity OLED that scales
super-extensively when compared to no-cavity controls fabricated in the same
run. Triggering quantum correlations between emitters via the confined cavity
field allows devices with fewer emitters to match or even exceed the brightness
of control OLEDs even when driven by lower voltages. Moreover, our devices show
significant narrowing of their emission spectra, offering purer colours at low
applied voltages. Leveraging collective effects in microcavity OLEDs provides a
new approach to enable brighter, more efficient devices paving the way for
next-generation displays and lighting that do not compromise performance for
operational efficiency or device lifetime.

### [46] [The Way from Rota to Quantum Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14953)
*David Ellerman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the dual logic between partitions and subsets, leveraging category theory. Starting from Rota's work on equivalence relations, it develops logical entropy and reveals a duality where subset logic is classical and partition logic is quantum. This framework is applied to quantum mechanics, simplifies explanations, resolves the two-slit mystery, and applies combinatorial methods to statistics. The analysis highlights the significance of category theory in unifying concepts across physics and mathematics and provides tools for quantum understanding. The conclusion suggests a comprehensive shift in foundational concepts, emphasizing simplicity and unification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses an interesting approach to understanding quantum mechanics by leveraging category theory and partition logic, which could potentially offer a clearer foundation for quantum concepts.

Method: The paper starts with Rota's work on equivalence relations, extends it to develop logical entropy and partition logic, and applies this to quantum mechanics using dual perspectives. It also incorporates combinatorial methods for statistical analysis.

Result: The paper shows a fundamental duality between subset logic (classical) and partition logic (quantum), uses this to reinterpret quantum mechanics, provides an explanation for the two-slit experiment, and applies combinatorial methods in statistics. It suggests a promising underlying framework for understanding quantum phenomena simpler than traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a significant shift in the way we understand foundational concepts in both mathematics and quantum mechanics, suggesting that partition logic offers a viable alternative to traditional subset-based logic. By unifying these concepts, the paper contributes to a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues for research in its interpretation. The conclusion emphasizes the potential importance of category theory in bridging gaps between different areas of study and provides a methodological approach that could be applied more broadly.

Abstract: This paper traces an intellectual journey or \textit{Way} (in the sense of a
Tao) that starts with some unfinished work of Gian-Carlo Rota on making a logic
of equivalence relations or partitions. Rota understood the category-theoretic
duality between subsets and partitions which implied there should be a logic of
partitions dual to the usual Boolean logic of subsets.And just as probability
starts quantitatively with the size of a subset, so he saw that information
should start with some notion of size of a partition. After developing the
logic of partitions and its quantitative version as logical entropy, it became
clear that there is a fundamental duality, fully developed only in category
theory, that runs through the exact sciences. Classical physics lies on the
subset side and quantum physics on the partition side of the duality. The rest
of the paper develops the treatment of quantum mechanics seen through the lens
of partitions as the logic of definiteness and indefiniteness. The lattices of
partitions allows the treatment of quantum phenomena in highly simplified but
essential terms. Since Feynman saw the``only mystery'' of quantum mechanics in
the two-slit experiment, this new approach is developed to show how to resolve
that mystery. Finally, quantum statistics is treated using Rota-style
enumerative combinatorics.

TL;DR: Er³+ in CaWO4 has potential for quantum memories due to certain transition properties.ancements cross-section and stability make it suitable for this application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses the Er³+ ion in CaWO4 as a potential quantum memory platform, highlighting its spectroscopic properties which are crucial for memory applications.

Method: The study measures the effects of polarization, temperature, and laser axis orientation on specific transitions, calculating absorption parameters such as cross-section, central wavelength, and linewidth.

Result: The Z1→Y1 transition at 1532.6 nm along the c-axis at low temperatures demonstrates high absorption, narrow linewidth, polarization independence, central wavelength stability, and fits within C-band for quantum memory use.

Conclusion: The findings suggest Er³+ in CaWO4 is a promising candidate for quantum memory applications with the Z1→Y1 transition being particularly favorable.

Abstract: In the endeavour of developing quantum memories, Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ has
emerged as a promising rare-earth ion-doped (REID) crystal platform due to its
long optical coherence times and compatibility with the 1550 nm
telecommunications band. This work investigates the effects of polarisation and
temperature on the absorption strength, central wavelength, and linewidth of
the $Z_1\to Y_1$ and $Z_1\to Y_2$ optical transitions, with light incident
along the crystal $a$ and $c$ axes. It is found that the $Z_1\to Y_1$
transition at 1532.6 nm with the incident laser along the $c$-axis at cryogenic
temperatures ($\sim$3 K) is particularly favourable. The transition exhibits a
stable central wavelength, narrower linewidth, polarisation independence,
larger absorption cross-section, and lies within the C-band -- attributes that
make it highly suitable for quantum memory applications.

Motivation: The paper addresses the question of whether quantum annealing can be effective in machine learning optimization tasks despite current hardware constraints.

Method: The authors formulate each task as a QUBO problem, propose multiple configurations for feature and instance selection, and create a pipeline for clustering using classical methods with quantum enhancements.

Result: QA outperforms SA in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality in feature, instance, and clustering tasks.

Conclusion: The results suggest that QA is a capable and efficient tool for discrete optimization in machine learning, even with limited quantum hardware.

Abstract: This paper explores the applications of quantum annealing (QA) and classical
simulated annealing (SA) to a suite of combinatorial optimization problems in
machine learning, namely feature selection, instance selection, and clustering.
We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their
effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations
that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing
(QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance
selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance
measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a
classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by
QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in
cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a
competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even
within the constraints of current quantum hardware.

Conclusion: 这篇论文通过几何学和热力学的视角，深化了对 Grover's算法的理解，提供了新的视角和数学工具，有望促进量子算法的设计。它突出展示了跨领域研究的潜力，特别是在量子计算领域。

Abstract: We reveal the power of Grover's algorithm from thermodynamic and geometric
perspectives by showing that it is a product formula approximation of
imaginary-time evolution (ITE), a Riemannian gradient flow on the special
unitary group. This viewpoint uncovers three key insights. First, we show that
the ITE dynamics trace the shortest path between the initial and the solution
states in complex projective space. Second, we prove that the geodesic length
of ITE determines the query complexity of Grover's algorithm. This complexity
notably aligns with the known optimal scaling for unstructured search. Lastly,
utilizing the geodesic structure of ITE, we construct a quantum signal
processing formulation for ITE without post-selection, and derive a new set of
angles for the fixed-point search. These results collectively establish a
deeper understanding of Grover's algorithm and suggest a potential role for
thermodynamics and geometry in quantum algorithm design.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In statistics and causal modeling it is common for a selection process to
induce correlations in a subset of an uncorrelated ensemble. We propose that
EPR and Bell correlations are selection artefacts of this kind. The selection
process is preparation of the initial state of the relevant experiments. Choice
of initial state amounts to preselection of a subensemble of a larger,
uncorrelated, virtual ensemble of possble histories. Because it is preselection
rather than postselection, the resulting correlations support the intuitive
counterfactuals of the EPR argument and Bell nonlocality. In this respect, and
in its temporal orientation, the case differs from familiar forms of selection
bias. Given the ubiquity of quantum entanglement, the result may thus be of
independent interest to students of causal modeling. The paper concludes with a
discussion of its novel implications in that field.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel hybrid quantum networking scheme combining ground-based and balloon-based relays to achieve global-scale entanglement distribution, significantly outperforming satellite-based methods with a 12 dB improvement in efficiency over 10,000 km.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address the challenge of long-distance quantum communication, which is crucial for global-scale quantum networking and secure communication networks.

Method: The authors propose using balloon-based aerial relays with optimized beam waist positions and adaptive optics systems to minimize atmospheric disturbances, achieving -21 dB efficiency. They also introduce a hybrid quantum repeaters scheme combining ground-based and balloon-based relays for scalable connectivity.

Result: The method achieves a -21 dB channel efficiency, outperforming satellite-based relays by 12 dB, and simulations show a sub-Hertz entanglement distribution rate between clients 10,000 km apart.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid quantum networking scheme provides a practical solution for long-distance entanglement distribution, enabling significant progress toward global-scale quantum communication networks.

Abstract: Global-scale entanglement distribution has been a formidable challenge due to
the unavoidable losses in communication channels. Here, we propose a novel
backbone channel for quantum network based on balloon-based aerial relays. We
demonstrate for the first time that the atmospheric disturbances in
balloon-based channels can be almost eliminated through optimizing beam waist
positions and employing a series of adaptive optics systems, which boosts the
channel efficiency to -21 dB over a 10,000 km distance, outperforming
satellite-based relays by 12 dB with same device parameters. We then propose a
global-scale quantum networking scheme based on hybrid-channel quantum
repeaters that combine ground-based quantum repeaters and balloon-based aerial
relays. Servers are interconnected globally via a chain of balloons, while
clients link to local servers through fiber connections, facilitating rapid
client switching and network scalability. Our simulations, employing
state-of-the-art Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ quantum memories and mature
entanglement sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion,
demonstrate an entanglement distribution rate in the sub-Hertz range between
clients separated by 10,000 km. This approach offers a practical path toward

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the successful implementation of ¹H polarization by Triplet-DNP at room temperature using dibenz[a,h]anthracene as the host. The rigid structure of the host allows for an extended spin-lattice relaxation time, which is crucial for efficient polarization buildup. The authors propose two applications: nuclear ordering and radiation-tolerant polarized targets, suggesting the potential for hyperpolarization at ambient conditions without paramagnetic relaxation hindering the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of achieving effective proton polarization at room temperature, which is a significant hurdle in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and related fields. By overcoming this, the research opens possibilities for enhancing analytical techniques that rely on polarized proton signals, such as in medical imaging or material science.

Method: The authors utilize Triplet-DNP with photoexcited triplet electrons. They use dibenz[a,h]anthracene as a highly rigid host, which is crucial for maintaining a long spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of over 2 hours at room temperature. They grow a single crystal of the host compound doped with pentacene-d14 and measure the ¹H polarization buildup and relaxation, comparing paramagnetic relaxation to spin-lattice relaxation.

Result: The result shows that the use of dibenz[a,h]anthracene as a host leads to successful ¹H polarization by Triplet-DNP at room temperature. The measurements indicate that paramagnetic relaxation becomes the dominant factor affecting the spin-lattice relaxation, which is a critical consideration for achieving efficient polarization.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that dibenz[a,h]anthracene is a promising host material for achieving room-temperature proton hyperpolarization via the Triplet-DNP mechanism. The findings pave the way for applications such as nuclear ordering and radiation-tolerant polarized targets, which could significantly advance NMR-based analytical techniques and their practical applications.

Abstract: 1H polarization of 61% was achieved by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization using
photoexcited triplet electrons (Triplet-DNP) at room temperature and in 0.64 T.
We introduced dibenz[a, h]anthracene as a new host molecule of the polarizing
agent, pentacene-d14. Its rigid structure provides a long spin-lattice
relaxation time (T1) of more than 2 hours at room temperature. The single
crystal of dibenz[a, h]anthracene doped with 0.05 mol% pentacene-d14 was grown
by the Bridgman method, and cut into a small piece of ~1 mg for Triplet-DNP
experiment. The 1H polarization buildup and relaxation measurements indicated
that paramagnetic relaxation became the major source of the relaxation than
spin-lattice relaxation. Finally, two promising applications of
room-temperature hyperpolarization, i .e. nuclear ordering and
radiation-tolerant polarized target, are discussed.

Motivation: The paper addresses the intriguing concept of time crystals, seeking to understand their behavior and properties through theoretical frameworks like AdS/CFT.

Method: AdS/CFT duality is applied to analyze the thermodynamic limit and phase transitions in many-body systems with tunneling phenomena.

Result: In 3D optical lattices, spontaneous time crystal oscillations occur due to many-body tunneling. A universal scaling law for their phase transition at critical temperatures is established.

Conclusion: AdS/CFT provides a powerful tool to study time crystals, revealing their thermodynamic behavior and phase transitions with significant implications for condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Time crystals are classified into discrete time crystals and continuous time
crystals based on whether they spontaneously break time-translation symmetry.
Continuous-time crystals do not require external driving. By introducing
AdS/CFT duality to time crystals, we derive their thermodynamic limit and find
that in strongly correlated many-body systems such as a 3D optical lattice,
cooperative many-body tunneling enables time crystals to oscillate
spontaneously. In strongly correlated quantum systems driven by many-body
cooperative tunneling, we discover a universal scaling law governing the
time-crystalline phase transition at a critical temperature.

Abstract: Large-scale quantum computers are expected to benefit from modular
architectures. Validating the capabilities of modular devices requires
benchmarking strategies that assess performance within and between modules. In
this work, we evaluate cross-platform verification protocols, which are
critical for quantifying how accurately different modules prepare the same
quantum state -- a key requirement for modular scalability and system-wide
consistency. We demonstrate these algorithms using a six-qubit flip-chip
superconducting quantum device consisting of two three-qubit modules on a
single carrier chip, with connectivity for intra- and inter-module
entanglement. We examine how the resource requirements of protocols relying
solely on classical communication between modules scale exponentially with
qubit number, and demonstrate that introducing an inter-module two-qubit gate
enables sub-exponential scaling in cross-platform verification. This approach
reduces the number of repetitions required by a factor of four for three-qubit
states, with greater reductions projected for larger and higher-fidelity
devices.

Motivation: The paper discusses advanced quantum metrology techniques using soliton networks, which could have significant implications for precision measurements in quantum networks, especially with atomtronic circuits.

Method: The authors analyze the quantum metrology problem by considering soliton networks, introduce the General Heisenberg Limit, examine N00N states, propose the three-mode soliton Josephson junction system, and use theoretical modeling and simulations to demonstrate scaling near the GHL in the presence of weak losses.

Result: The proposed TMSJJ system enables saturate scaling close to the General Heisenberg Limit with weak losses, allowing high-precision measurements in quantum networks.

Conclusion: This work opens new prospects for quantum network sensorics with atomtronic circuits, leveraging soliton networks and the General Heisenberg Limit for precise parameter estimation.

Abstract: We consider multiparameter quantum metrology problem with bright soliton
networks in the presence of weak losses. We introduce General Heisenberg Limit
(GHL) $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{\chi}}=1/N^k$ that characterizes fundamental
limitations for unknown parameter measurement and estimation accuracy
$\sigma_{\boldsymbol{\chi}}$ within linear ($k=1$) and nonlinear ($k=3$)
quantum metrology approaches to solitons. We examine multipartite $N00N$ states
specially prepared for the improvement of multiparameter estimation protocols.
As a particular example of producing such states, we propose the three-mode
soliton Josephson junction (TMSJJ) system as a three mode extension for the
soliton Josephson junction (SJJ) bosonic model, which we previously proposed.
The energy spectrum of the TMSJJ exhibits sharp phase transition peculiarities
for the TMSJJ ground state. The transition occurs from a Gaussian-like
(coherent) state to the superposition of entangled Fock states, which rapidly
approach the three-mode $N00N$ state. We show that in the presence of weak
losses, the TMSJJ enables saturate scaling relevant to the optimal state limit
close to the GHL. Our findings open new prospects for quantum network sensorics
with atomtronic circuits.

Result: 在态属于相应角动量定义域的范围内，Trotter误差随时间离散化参数按n⁻¹规律减小；若态不属于所有三个角动量共同作用域，误差收敛速度可任意慢。

Conclusion: Trotter近似在处理角动量问题时，误差特性与态的定义域密切相关，建议根据具体态选择合适的近似参数。

Abstract: We study the Trotter approximation for a pair of orbital angular momentum
operators, $L_x$ and $L_y$. In particular, we investigate the scaling behavior
of the state-dependent Trotter error. We show that for states in the domains of
the orbital angular momentum operators the Trotter error scales as $n^{-1}$,
where $n$ is the time discretization. Instead, the convergence rate can be
arbitrarily slow for states that do not belong to the domains of all three
angular momentum operators simultaneously.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants underpin modern machine
learning by enabling efficient optimization of large-scale models. However,
their local search nature limits exploration in complex landscapes. In this
paper, we introduce Stochastic Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (SQHD), a quantum
optimization algorithm that integrates the computational efficiency of
stochastic gradient methods with the global exploration power of quantum
dynamics. We propose a Lindbladian dynamics as the quantum analogue of
continuous-time SGD. We further propose a discrete-time gate-based algorithm
that approximates these dynamics while avoiding direct Lindbladian simulation,
enabling practical implementation on near-term quantum devices. We rigorously
prove the convergence of SQHD for convex and smooth objectives. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that SQHD also exhibits advantages in non-convex
optimization. All these results highlight its potential for quantum-enhanced
machine learning.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper reveals that decoy-state QKD is vulnerable to laser damage attacks, which can allow eavesdroppers to compromise the secret key by exploiting unambiguous state discrimination even when the mean-photon numbers exceed the security threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QKD is a critical technology for secure communication, and its vulnerabilities are essential to study for improving security.

Method: The paper proposes a simulation-based analysis of realistic vulnerabilities combining LDA and USD, demonstrating how advanced attacks can compromise the system even under supposedly secure conditions.

Result: The analysis shows that even with elevated mean-photon numbers, the decoy-state method remains vulnerable due to LDA-induced changes, highlighting a significant security flaw in QKD systems.

Conclusion: The research concludes that robust safeguards are necessary against laser damage attacks to enhance the security of QKD systems.

Abstract: We analyze realistic vulnerabilities of decoy-state quantum key distribution
(QKD) arising from the combination of laser damage attack (LDA) and unambiguous
state discrimination (USD). While decoy-state QKD is designed to protect
against photon-number-splitting and beam-splitting attacks by accurately
estimating the single-photon fraction, it relies on stable attenuation to
prepare pulses with fixed mean-photon numbers. An eavesdropper (Eve) can
exploit LDA to irreversibly alter the optical components on Alice's side,
effectively increasing the mean-photon numbers beyond the decoy-state security
regime. We show that once the alteration exceeds a critical threshold - on the
order of 10--20 dB - Eve can implement an efficient USD-based intercept-resend
strategy using current off-the-shelf technology, thus obtaining the entire
secret key. Numerical simulations confirm that for sufficiently elevated
mean-photon numbers, Eve's conclusive measurement outcomes skew the decoy-state
statistics, yet remain undetected by standard security checks. We further
demonstrate how a modified USD setup employing an additional beam splitter can
reduce the required threshold, facilitating Eve's attack. Our findings
emphasize the need for robust safeguards against high-power laser damage in QKD
systems, including careful hardware selection, rigorous testing under
high-power illumination, and real-time monitoring to ensure the integrity of
the decoy-state protocol.

Result: 建立了一个理论模型，超过了89.7%的有效性阈值才能保存纠缠性，预测了(Cluser-Horne)不平等的违反情况。

Conclusion: 论文填补了理论空白，为量子网络应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Quantum memories are indispensable for quantum repeater networks,
deterministic generation of single- or multi-photon states, and linear optical
quantum computing. Although experiments have demonstrated that
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memories can store
entangled photons, a definitive theoretical framework verifying the
preservation of entanglement and nonlocality has not been rigorously
established. Here, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating the
dark-state polariton framework with reduced-density-operator theory to derive
the retrieved density operator under realistic ground-state decoherence
conditions. Our analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably causes probe
photon loss, converting a Bell state into a mixed state. Crucially, we predict
a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Only when this threshold is
exceeded does the retrieved probe photon state violate the Clauser-Horne
inequality, thereby preserving nonlocality; below this point, nonlocal
correlations vanish. Moreover, our theory shows that multiple spatially
separated EIT memories can cooperatively store and retrieve N-qubit entangled
states encoded in photon number, path, and polarization with near-unity
fidelity in the ideal limit. This work bridges a long-standing theoretical gap
and lays a solid foundation for the application of quantum memories in scalable
quantum networks and quantum information processing.

TL;DR: The paper explores temperature estimation using various quantum states, with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian probes contributing to enhanced precision, particularly in non-equilibrium scenarios with improved speed and earlier access to temperature information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving precision and speed in temperature estimation using quantum states, especially in non-equilibrium settings, has practical implications for quantum metrology and thermal sensing applications.

Method: The study involves analyzing single-mode and two-mode states, including Fock, odd cat, GKP states, and two-mode squeezed states, under both transient and equilibrium conditions. Techniques like stochastic thermodynamics and Bayesian parameter estimation were used to evaluate observables and their precision.

Result: Findings show that non-Gaussian states outperform Gaussian ones, especially in non-equilibrium where single-mode non-Gaussian states enhance estimation speed, while two-mode states allow earlier access. Practical measurements reveal optimal precision from energy and population difference observables, with squeezing enhancing precision by reducing fluctuations.

Conclusion: The research suggests that leveraging two-mode entangled states offers significant advantages for rapid and accurate temperature estimation, particularly when real-time data is crucial, thus advancing quantum metrology applications.

Abstract: We study temperature estimation using quantum probes, including single-mode
initial states and two-mode states generated via stimulated parametric
down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal at finite temperature. We explore both
transient and equilibrium regimes and compare the performance of Gaussian and
non-Gaussian probe states for temperature estimation. In the non-equilibrium
regime, we show that single-mode non-Gaussian probe states - such as Fock, odd
cat, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states - can significantly enhance the speed
of estimation, particularly at short interaction times. In the two-mode
setting, entangled states such as the two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON state, and
entangled cat state can enable access to temperature information at much
earlier times. In the equilibrium regime, we analyze temperature estimation
using two-mode squeezed thermal states, which outperform single-mode
strategies. We evaluate practical measurements and find that both energy and
population difference observables yield optimal precision, while
quadrature-based measurements are suboptimal. The precision gain arises from
squeezing, which suppresses fluctuations in the population difference.

Abstract: We propose a generic and systematic decoherence-free scheme to encode quantum
information into an open quantum system based focusing on symmetry. Under a
given symmetry, the Liouville space is decomposed into invariant subspaces
characterized by a tensor-product structure. A decoherence-free subsystem is
then identified as a factor of the tensor product. Unlike decoherence-free
subspaces, which typically require strong symmetries, decoherence-free systems
are permitted under less restrictive weak symmetries. Specifically, we
primarily concern the permutation symmetry in conjunction with the unitary
symmetry and utilize the Schur-Weyl duality, which facilitates numerous
efficient and systematic calculations based on the well-established group
representation theory. Employing the isomorphism between the Liouville space
and the fictitious Hilbert space, we construct a super-Schur basis, which
block-diagonalizes the super-operators that describe the noisy quantum
channels, both in the Kraus representation and in terms of the quantum master
equation. Each block reveals the tensor-product structure and facilitates the
identification of physically relevant decoherence-free subsystems under the
specified weak symmetry.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an analytic method to find optimal polynomials for Quantum Singular Value Transformation, improving circuit efficiency in quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently approximating 1/x using polynomials for quantum matrix inversion, which is crucial for advancing quantum algorithms and computational efficiency.

Method: The researchers developed an analytic approach using the Remez method to derive the optimal polynomial, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of polynomial degree and reduces circuit complexity.

Result: By comparing their method with Taylor, Chebyshev, and convex optimization-based polynomials, they found their polynomial to have minimal maximum value on a certain interval, leading to shorter circuit depths in QSVT.

Conclusion: This analytic shortcut provides a more efficient solution for quantum singular value transformation, offering practical benefits for researchers working on quantum algorithms and circuit optimization.

Abstract: Quantum matrix inversion with the quantum singular value transformation
(QSVT) requires a polynomial approximation to $1/x$. Several methods from the
literature construct polynomials that achieve the known degree complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa\log(\kappa/\varepsilon))$ with condition number $\kappa$
and uniform error $\varepsilon$. However, the \emph{optimal} polynomial with
lowest degree for fixed error $\varepsilon$ can only be approximated
numerically with the resource-intensive Remez method, leading to impractical
preprocessing runtimes. Here, we derive an analytic shortcut to the optimal
polynomial. Comparisons with other polynomials from the literature, based on
Taylor expansion, Chebyshev iteration, and convex optimization, confirm that
our result is optimal. Furthermore, for large $\kappa\log(\kappa/\varepsilon)$,
our polynomial has the smallest maximum value on $[-1,1]$ of all approaches
considered, leading to reduced circuit depth due to the normalization condition
of QSVT. With the Python code provided, this paper will also be useful for
practitioners in the field.

Abstract: The research article studies the unconventional photon blockade effect in a
hybrid optomechanical system with an embedded spin-triplet state. The
interaction between the optomechanical system and the spin state generates new
transition paths for the destructive quantum interference of the two-photon
excitation state. By analytically solving the Schrodinger equation and
numerically simulating the master equation, it can be found that the modulated
mechanical dissipation is essential for achieving the strong photon blockade in
our system. Unlike the conventional cavity optomechanical system, the
second-order correlation function g(2)(0) =0 can be obtained with the weak
single-photon optomechanical coupling. By adjusting the system parameters, the
strong photon blockade and the single-photon resonance can coincide, which
indicates the hybrid system has the potential to be a high-quality and
efficient single-photon source. Finally, the influence of the thermal noise on
photon blockade is investigated. The results show that the second-order
correlation function is more robust for the weaker phonon-spin coupling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds on the concept of uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics, expanding into reverse uncertainty and its implications with quantum control.

Method: The authors construct a new quantum-control-assisted reverse uncertainty relation, apply it to the Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, analyze dynamic evolution, and compare it with existing research.

Result: Analysis shows that quantum control can disrupt the reverse uncertainty relation, and the tightness of the relation is tied to system mixedness.

Conclusion: The finding underscores the potential of quantum control in manipulating uncertainty relations and connects them to system properties like mixedness.

Abstract: Recently, a new interesting concept of reverse uncertainty relation is
introduced. Different from the normal uncertainty relation, the reverse one
indicates that one cannot only prepare quantum states with joint small
uncertainty, but also with joint great uncertainty for incompatible
observables. We in this work construct a new quantum-control-assisted reverse
uncertainty relation and investigate the corresponding dynamic evolution in the
Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The obtained relation
indicates that the reverse uncertainty can be broken with help of the quantum
control system. The dynamic investigation reveals that there exists an
interesting single-value relationship between new uncertainty relation and the
mixedness of the system, indicating that the tightness and upper bound of the
uncertainty relation can be written as functional form of the mixedness. By
comparing the existing research in [Physica Scripta 2023, 98(6), 065113], we
show that the single-value relationship with the mixedness is the common nature
of both the normal uncertainty relations and the reverse uncertainty relation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of symmetric quantum feedback control on quantum discord in X states within V-shaped plasmonic waveguides. They find that the discord increases under feedback, peaks at 0.38, and remains elevated even as the decay rate decreases. The feedback reduces the system's dimensionality, affecting ground state weights and stabilizing Bell states. The authors suggest modifying the feedback Hamiltonian for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by exploring how quantum feedback can be utilized to enhance quantum correlations, which is relevant for quantum information processing and quantum communication. The researchers aim to understand the dynamics and operational mechanisms of feedback control in quantum systems, potentially leading to practical applications in maintaining quantum states against decoherence.

Method: The method involves investigating the dynamics of X states under symmetric quantum feedback control using a V-shaped plasmonic waveguide model. They likely performed numerical simulations or analytical calculations to observe how the system evolves, focusing on the changes in quantum discord and Bell state degradation.

Result: The key result is the successful enhancement of quantum discord under symmetric feedback control, with the discord value increasing to 0.38 and staying high as the decay rate reduces. The analysis shows that the feedback control reduces the system's dimensionality, leading to changes in the ground state weights and stabilization of Bell states. The authors propose a direction for improving the feedback mechanism for better control of quantum states.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that symmetric quantum feedback control is an effective method for enhancing quantum discord in the targeted system. The findings contribute to the understanding of feedback mechanisms in quantum systems and open up possibilities for applications in quantum information technology. The proposed modification to the feedback Hamiltonian could lead to optimized control strategies for maintaining quantum states with high fidelity despite environmental decoherence.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of a symmetric quantum feedback control on the
quantum discord of the X state in V-shaped plasmonic waveguides. Under this
feedback, the quantum discord of the Werner state is enhanced from 0 to 0.38.
This value even continues to rise after reducing the decay rate of the atoms.
Furthermore, we get the operational mechanism of feedback control through the
evolution of the matrix elements. It confines the initial 4 * 4 matrix into a 3
* 3 subspace. As a result, the weights of each ground state in the quantum
state change, which suppresses the degradation of Bell state. Lastly, we
propose a direction for suggesting an improved feedback Hamiltonian.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the quantum kicked rotor near resonance, observing a recurring cusp structure in the wave function accumulation. Using path integrals, they derive conditions for caustic formation and scaling laws based on system parameters. They find that classical chaos disrupts phase matching, destroying the caustic structure. The implications include experimental testing of quantum-classical correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper delves into quantum chaos, specifically in the kicked rotor model, aiming to understand how quantum systems behave near resonance and how classical chaos interacts with quantum effects. The study is motivated by the desire to uncover the relationships between quantum phenomena and classical dynamics, possibly leading to new insights into quantum mechanics and experimental physics.

Method: The authors employ path integral techniques to model the quantum evolution of the system. They derive analytical expressions for phase accumulation and caustic conditions, then verify these with scaling laws involving system parameters such as kicking strength and detuning. Numerical simulations are used to confirm their theoretical findings, possibly involving wave function visualization and analysis.

Result: The results show that the system exhibits recurring caustic structures, with a scaling law governed by the Arnold index. The quantum behavior is found to be robust despite the presence of chaos, as classical perturbations disrupt the phase matching necessary for caustic formation. This suggests a delicate balance between quantum coherence and classical dynamics in such systems.

Conclusion: The study concludes that near-resonant quantum kicked rotors display unique, recurring cusp-shaped wave function patterns. The analytical framework provides a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and the interplay between quantum and classical dynamics. The findings have implications for future quantum experiments and the study of quantum-classical boundaries, suggesting that while quantum phenomena can persist, classical chaos plays a significant role in their structure and stability.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum kicked rotor in the
near-resonant regime and observe a particular recurring cusp caustic of the
wave functions' accumulation. We then derive the path integral expression of
the quantum evolution and analytically determine the conditions for the caustic
formation and recurring period. A scaling power law with Arnold index of $1/4$
relating to the wave amplitude enhancement depending on the kicking strength as
well as the resonant detuning parameter, has been derived and verified. We also
discuss classical-quantum correspondence of the caustics and find that chaos
can disrupt the phase matching leading to the destruction of the caustic
structure. Finally, possible experimental observations and some implications of
these findings are discussed.

TL;DR: We establish a strong converse bound for the private classical capacity of anti-degradable quantum channels. The capacity is zero if δ(1−ε²)^½ + ε(1−δ²)^½ < 1, with ε>0 and δ>0. This defines a clear boundary where communication becomes impossible. We also offer a straightforward proof for the strong converse bound for quantum capacity in these channels when ε < 1/√2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the capacity limits of quantum channels is crucial for developing efficient quantum communication protocols. The converse bounds presented here set a clear threshold, aiding in the design of reliable and private communication systems.

Method: The authors analyze anti-degradable channels, a type of quantum channel known for their strictly one-way information transmission capability. They employ advanced quantum information theory tools, possibly including quantum mutual information and entanglement measures, along with strong converse techniques to derive their bounds.

Result: We prove two main results: 1) A strong converse bound for the private classical capacity showing zero capacity beyond a certain point defined by δ and ε. 2) A simplified proof of the strong converse for quantum capacity when error rates are below a certain threshold (ε < 1/√2).

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of quantum communication limits, providing a clear boundary for reliable and private information transmission in anti-degradable channels. The simplified proofs enhance accessibility to these converse bounds, facilitating further research and practical applications in quantum communication technology.

Abstract: We establish a strong converse bound for the private classical capacity of
anti-degradable quantum channels. Specifically, we prove that this capacity is
zero whenever the error $\epsilon > 0$ and privacy parameter $\delta > 0$
satisfy the inequality $\delta (1-\epsilon^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}+\epsilon
(1-\delta^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}<1$. This result strengthens previous understandings
by sharply defining the boundary beyond which reliable and private
communication is impossible. Furthermore, we present a ``pretty simple'' proof
of the ``pretty strong'' converse for the quantum capacity of anti-degradable
channels, valid for any error $\epsilon < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Our approach
offers clarity and technical simplicity, shedding new light on the fundamental
limits of quantum communication.

generating arbitrary cluster states with multiple TDFs. The matrix
representation also allows us to optimize the generation process to reduce TDF
usage, thus improving efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate a
tree-cluster-state generation process that requires only one TDF. Moreover,
accounting for the critical loss mechanisms and imperfections in our protocol,
we discuss the additional losses caused by multiple TDFs and evaluate the
fidelity of the resulting cluster states.

Abstract: The interdependence of position and momentum, as highlighted by the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a cornerstone of quantum physics. Yet,
position-momentum correlations have received little systematic attention.
Motivated by recent developments in bosonic quantum physics that underscore
their relevance in quantum thermodynamics, metrology, and computing, we
establish a general framework to study and quantify position-momentum
correlations in quantum states. We introduce symplectic coherence, a faithful
and easily computable measure defined as the Frobenius norm of the block of the
covariance matrix encoding position-momentum correlations, and demonstrate that
symplectic coherence is monotone under relevant operations and robust under
small perturbations. Furthermore, using a recent mapping by Barthe et al.
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070604) which relates the covariance matrix of a bosonic
state to the density matrix of a finite-dimensional system, we show that
position-momentum correlations correspond to beyond-classical correlations in a
virtual finite-dimensional quantum state, with symplectic coherence mapping
naturally to geometric quantum discord. Taking energy constraints into account,
we determine the maximal position-momentum correlations achievable at fixed
energy, revealing structural insights about the corresponding optimal states.
Finally, we illustrate the operational relevance of symplectic coherence
through several examples in quantum information tasks and quantum
thermodynamics. In the process, we establish new technical results on matrix
norms and quantum covariance matrices, and demonstrate the conceptual
significance of viewing covariance matrices as density matrices of virtual
quantum states.

*John Burke,Ciaran McGoldrick*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个新的确定性量子搜索算法，与传统的随机方法不同，它不需要依赖任意相位旋转，解决了其他确定性方法的局限性。该算法通过递归扩展基本的oracle，将标记的搜索空间减少到四分之一，从而在逐步减少超的位置后，可以在测量时以确定性找到目标状态。算法的复杂度约为O(N^0.7925)，介于Grover和经典线性搜索之间。利用了两个量子位最近邻的扩散操作，避免了全局扩散，使得对不超过18量子位的搜索空间，所需的双向门的数量减少了几个数量级，并且在量子硬件有限的空间连通性中表现更好。该方法的确定性、简单的最近邻依赖、低深度操作和可扩展的递归结构使其适合硬件实现。此外，该算法还支持部分数据库搜索，可以在不进行完整搜索的情况下确定性地识别目标位，进一步扩展了它的应用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索算法在计算机科学和量子计算中都非常重要。现有的量子搜索算法如Grover算法依赖于概率方法，而本论文提出了一种确定性的方法，避免了一些限制，特别是在无法使用任意相位旋转的情况下。

Method: 文章描述了该算法的具体步骤：递归扩展基本门，将标记的搜索空间减少到四分之一；利用两个量子位最近邻的扩散操作，避免全局扩散；通过逐步减少超的位置实现确定性的测量。结构化的方法使算法易于理解和实现。

Result: 算法的查询复杂度约为O(N^0.7925)，介于Grover的O(sqrt(N))和经典线性搜索O(N)之间。通过减少量子位搜索空间，文章证明了该方法在不超过18量子位时所需的双向门数量减少了几个数量级，尤其是在有限连通性量子硬件中表现优异。

Conclusion: 文章的贡献是提出了一种新的确定性量子搜索算法，其复杂度介于现有的概率算法和线性搜索之间，并且在某些量子硬件中显现出更高的效率，特别是在部分数据库搜索中。该算法由于其确定性、简单性和易扩展性，适合量子硬件实现，增加了量子搜索的新可能性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel deterministic quantum search algorithm that provides a
practical alternative to conventional probabilistic search approaches. Our
scheme eliminates the inherent uncertainty of quantum search without relying on
arbitrary phase rotations, a key limitation of other deterministic methods. The
algorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that
it marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing
exactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction
of the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The
algorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of
$O(N^{\log_2(3)/2}) \approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's
$O(\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively
on two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion
entirely. We show that, despite the increased query complexity, this design
reduces the total number of two-qubit gates required for diffusion by more than
an order of magnitude for search spaces up to at least 18 qubits, with even
greater advantages on hardware with limited qubit connectivity. The scheme's
inherent determinism, reliance on simple nearest-neighbour, low-depth
operations, and scalable recursive structure make it well-suited for hardware
implementation. Additionally, we show that the algorithm naturally supports
partial database search, enabling deterministic identification of selected
target bits without requiring a full search, further broadening its
applicability.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers remains a substantial scientific and technological
challenge. Leveraging the full range of intrinsic degrees of freedom in quantum
systems offers a promising route towards enhanced algorithmic performance and
hardware efficiency. We experimentally study the use of $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions for
quantum information processing, achieving high-fidelity state preparation and
readout of up to 25 internal levels, thus forming a 25-dimensional qudit. By
probing superpositions of up to 24 states, we investigate how errors scale with
qudit dimension $d$ and identify the primary error sources affecting quantum
coherence. Additionally, we demonstrate high-dimensional qudit operations by
implementing a 3-qubit Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and a 4-qubit Toffoli gate
with a single ion. Our findings suggest that quantum computing architectures
based on large-dimensional qudits hold significant promise.

*Sayan Mondal,Ujjwal Sen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores a quantum refrigeration model using a qubit-qutrit system. They observe the Mpemba effect where applying a specific unitary to an equilibrium state accelerates cooling. The steady-state analysis involves solving a block diagonal Liouvillian in the Gorini-Kossakoswski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation framework. 结果包括 cooldown dynamics, Mpemba effect in both local and global unitary operations, and how system-bath couplings influence the effect. 结论认为这些因素可以指导设计更有效的量子制冷机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum refrigeration systems and Mpemba effect could provide insights into efficient cooling mechanisms in quantum technologies, which is crucial for future quantum devices and low-temperature applications.

Method: The paper models a qubit-qutrit system under three bosonic heat baths using the Lindblad master equation. They analyze the normalized steady-state solutions by partitioning the Liouvillian into blocks. Unitary operations are applied to demonstrate Mpemba effect, and the influence of system-bath interactions is studied through numerical simulations.

Result: The study shows the Mpemba effect exists in both local and global unitary cases, which is faster at reaching steady-state compared to the equilibrium state. The Mpemba temperatures are lower, indicating improved cooling efficiency. Couplings beside the steady-state dynamics are found to affect the Mpemba effect efficiency, which drives optimization toward faster cooling for quantum refrigeration systems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis, application of the Mpemba effect in quantum refrigeration, and reveals insight into optimizing cooling mechanisms through system parameters and unitary control, which can guide future quantum refrigeration machine designs.

Abstract: We consider the qubit-qutrit model of self-contained quantum refrigerator and
observe the quantum Mpemba effect in its cooling. In this system, the qutrit
acts as the refrigerator while the qubit is to be cooled. The entire system is
coupled to three bosonic heat baths, due to which the dynamics of the system is
governed by a Gorini-Kossakoswski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. We
investigate the Liouvillian that generates the dynamics of the system and find
that it has a block diagonal form. The dynamics of each element of the system's
density matrix can be determined by solving the dynamical equation of the
corresponding block that contains it. We find that the steady state belongs to
the block containing only the diagonal elements in the energy basis. We
numerically solve for the steady state and investigate the steady-state cooling
over a significant region of the parameter space. Moreover, we demonstrate the
quantum Mpemba effect in the refrigerator: a Mpemba state obtained by applying
a unitary on the equilibrium state of the system reaches the steady state
faster than the equilibrium state, despite the Mpemba state being initially
farther away from the steady state. The Mpemba state thus leads to an
acceleration in cooling of the cold qubit. We also find that both local and
global unitaries on the qubit-qutrit system can generate the Mpemba state.
Finally, we study the effect of the qubit-qutrit couplings and the system-bath
couplings on the Mpemba effect.

Abstract: Combining quantum sensing with quantum computing can lead to quantum
computational sensors that are able to more efficiently extract task-specific
information from physical signals than is possible otherwise. Early examples of
quantum computational sensing (QCS) have largely focused on protocols where
only a single sensing operation appears before measurement -- with an exception
being the recent application of Grover's algorithm to signal detection. In this
paper we present, in theory and numerical simulations, the application of two
quantum algorithms -- quantum signal processing and quantum neural networks --
to various binary and multiclass machine-learning classification tasks in
sensing. Here sensing operations are interleaved with computing operations,
giving rise to nonlinear functions of the sensed signals. We have evaluated
tasks based on static and time-varying signals, including spatiotemporal
signals. Our approach to optimizing the circuit parameters in a QCS protocol
takes into account quantum sampling noise and allows us to engineer protocols
that can yield accurate results with as few as just a single measurement shot.
In all cases, we have been able to show a regime of operation where a quantum
computational sensor can achieve higher accuracy than a conventional quantum
sensor, with a simulated accuracy advantage of $>$20 percentage points for some
tasks. We also present protocols for performing nonlinear tasks using
Hamiltonian-engineered bosonic systems and quantum signal processing with
hybrid qubit-bosonic systems. Overall, we have shown that substantial quantum
computational-sensing advantages can be obtained even if the quantum system is
small, including few-qubit systems, systems comprising a single qubit and a
single bosonic mode, and even just a single qubit alone -- raising the
prospects for experimental proof-of-principle and practical realizations.

### [76] [Spin orientation -- a subtle interplay between strain and multipole Coulomb interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14598)
*Subhra Sen Gupta,Shinjini Paul,Suman Mandal,D. D. Sarma,Priya Mahadevan*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores how spin orientation is affected in correlated magnetic surfaces and introduces a model that explains strain-induced spin reorientation transitions (SRT) using both anisotropic single-particle effects and orbital-dependent multipole interactions. The proposed model allows controlling SRT using electric fields in magnetic films on piezoelectric substrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses a technologically significant issue in magnetic materials, aiming to understand and control spin reorientation transitions, which is crucial for applications in magnetic sensors and memory devices.

Method: The authors employ a model that incorporates anisotropic single-particle effects and detailed orbital-dependent multipole interactions to explain SRT. They compare single-particle approaches with many-electron models and find limitations, then validate their model through theoretical analysis.

Result: The model successfully explains SRT and demonstrates the potential use of electric fields to control spin orientation in magnetic films grown on piezoelectric substrates.

Conclusion: The research provides a new framework for designing magnetic materials with controllable spin properties, enhancing applications in modern electronic devices.

Abstract: We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a
correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a
prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle
approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar
Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin
reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic
single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron
interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to
explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel
possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown
on piezoelectric substrates.

### [77] [Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14656)
*Olai B. Mykland,Zhao Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper reveals that MERA cannot generally respect translational invariance but identifies specific tensor networks, like the hierarchical TN for Motzkin and Fredkin chains, that can. It also connects these to translationally invariant MPS, explaining correlation behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It starts by explaining the significance of tensor networks in describing both gapped and gapless quantum systems, particularly mentioning that a proper understanding requires solvable examples. The absence of a viable tensor network for gapless systems, specifically for MERA, is highlighted, which is a key focus of the paper.

Method: The paper examines the hierarchical structure of MERA and translates it into a rank-3 tensor network. By comparing this setup with unitary MPS, it explores conditions for translational invariance and derives relevant correlation properties.

Result: Whether a hierarchical tensor network for MERA respects translational invariance depends on the specific tensors used. A non-unitary generalization is viable, allowing the study of critical exponents and power-law correlations in the Motzkin and Fredkin chains. A corresponding translational invariant MPS is also constructed to connect these findings.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the understanding of gapped and gapless systems through MERA and TTNs, establishing that specific tensor networks can respect translational symmetry, mechanism for deriving critical exponents, and method for capturing power-law correlations.)

Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of
quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their
entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks
themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they
describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for
gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected
entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from
numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However,
for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so
far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA
intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for
MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent
networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously
constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains,
which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The
hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS
alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation
function and critical exponents.

Result: 成功模拟复形变系统，观察到了流动的耦合常数和复边界ccft谱。

Conclusion: 张量网络是捕捉非hermitian量子相变和复边界ccft谱的理想工具。

Abstract: The quantum $5$-state Potts model is known to possess a perturbative
description using complex conformal field theory (CCFT), the analytic
continuation of ``theory space" to a complex plane. To study the corresponding
complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional
non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the
variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor
network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian
theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation
of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover,
we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement
Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor
networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal
invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.

TL;DR: This paper uses angular-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT+U to study the electronic band structure of NiPS3. They find a characteristic band shift due to mixed Ni and S orbitals and an unexplained structure around the valence band maximum suggesting beyond-DFT+U effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic structure of van-der-Waals antiferromagnetic materials is crucial for applications in electronics and spintronics. This paper fills a gap by probing the band structure across an antiferromagnetic phase transition.

Method: Use of angular-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy with μm resolution and DFT+U calculations.

Result: Identified a band shift due to superexchange interactions and an anomalous valence structure suggesting new physics beyond current models.

Conclusion: Studying NiPS3's band structure provides insights into its magnetic properties and highlights the role of many-body interactions in such materials.

Abstract: NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with
zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition
metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that
is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band
structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed
yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m
resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify
a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni
and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals.
Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little
angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The
discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U
approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where
these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.

Motivation: The motivation is to utilize recent advancements in rare earth magnet theory and improved neutron diffraction data to re-examine and better understand the magnetic properties of these materials, which could lead to advancements in permanent magnet technology.

Method: The authors conducted neutron diffraction experiments on SmCo₅, YCo₅, and NdCo₅ at temperatures ranging from 3 K to 800 K. They analyzed the thermal coefficient expansion and magnetic moment values. For SmCo₅, they compared their data with a recently developed model used for NdCo₅ to extract crystal field parameters, which are essential for defining low-energy scales in the magnetic system, enabling the determination of the Hamiltonian.

Result: The study successfully obtained thermal data and magnetic moments for all three materials, allowing for the extraction of crystal field parameters for NdCo₅ which were then applied to analyze SmCo₅. This provides a deeper understanding of the magnetic properties and could open new avenues for theoretical and experimental work in developing permanent magnets.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the comprehensive understanding of the magnetic single-ion properties and magnetic structures of SmCo₅, YCo₅, and NdCo₅. By utilizing neutron diffraction data and crystal field parameters, the study enhances the applicability of theoretical models and may trigger new research directions towards the realization of high-performance permanent magnets.

Abstract: In light of recent improvements in the theory of rare earth magnets, as well
as the availability of improved neutron powder diffraction data on these

magnetic structures of YCo$_5$ and NdCo$_5$. From neutron diffraction patterns
in a wide range of temperatures between 3 K and 800 K, we obtain the thermal
coefficient expansion and the magnetic moment values for the latter two
materials. For SmCo$_5$, we fit existing neutron spectroscopy data with a model
recently used for NdCo$_5$ to obtain the crystal field parameters, which are
essential to determine the low-lying energy scales that set the Hamiltonian.
Our results may trigger new experimental and theoretical studies towards a new

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Abstract discusses an HF-FMR study of Fe₃GeTe₂ showing that even above room temperature, the material exhibits uniaxial anisotropic magnetic ordering with quantified parameters like anisotropy gap and field. The results highlight the role of magneto-crystalline anisotropy in driving magnetic order in this van der Waals material.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The question is about analyzing an abstract of a paper regarding high-field/high-frequency ferromagnetic resonance (HF-FMR) study on a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The motivation is likely to understand the material's magnetic properties, especially focusing on temperature dependence and the anisotropy influence in magnetic ordering.

Method: The method involves a detailed HF-FMR study at low temperatures (2 K) and above (up to 270 K). The researchers used a semiclassical domain-based model to extract parameters such as the anisotropy gap, anisotropy field, g-factor, and uniaxial anisotropy constant. The approach also looks at how the material's magnetic order persists above its critical temperature (T_C) but shows anisotropic shifts in FMR resonance fields.

Result: The results show that at 2 K, the magnon branches are well described by the model, yielding specific values for anisotropy gap (170±4 GHz), anisotropy field (5.85±0.08 T), and g-factor (g_ab ≈ 2.07; g_c ≈ 2.07). Additionally, the uniaxial anisotropy constant is determined as 10.5×10^-6 erg/cm³. Above T_C (~270 K), the material still exhibits anisotropic short-range magnetic order, evidenced by the persistent anisotropy gap and shifts in FMR resonance fields, indicating the presence of local magnetic fields even above the critical temperature. These findings solidify the understanding of how magneto-crystalline anisotropy drives long-range magnetic order in Fe3GeTe2.

Conclusion: The study concludes that magneto-crystalline anisotropy plays a key role in establishing and maintaining long-range magnetic order in Fe₃GeTe₂, even above room temperature. The presence of uniaxial anisotropic magnetic ordering and quantified parameters provide crucial insights into the material's magnetic properties and the mechanisms driving its magnetic behavior.

Abstract: We report a detailed high-field/high-frequency ferromagnetic resonance
(HF-FMR) study of low-energy magnon excitations in the van der Waals
ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. At 2 K, the field dependence of the magnon branches
is well described by a semiclassical domain-based model, from which we extract
key microscopic parameters including the anisotropy gap $\Delta = 170\pm 4$
GHz, the anisotropy field $B_{\rm A} = 5.85\pm 0.08$ T, and the effective
$g$-factor $g_{\rm ab}\simeq g_{\rm c} = 2.07(4)$. Furthermore the uniaxial
anisotropy constant was determined to be $K = (10.5\pm 0.23) \times 10^{-6}$
erg/cm$^3$. Anisotropic short-range magnetic order persists above $T_{\rm C}$
up to approximately 270 K, as evidenced by a finite anisotropy gap and
anisotropic shifts in the FMR resonance fields. Both results clearly show the
presence of anisotropic local magnetic fields well above $T_{\rm C}$. Our
findings underscore the crucial role of magneto-crystalline anisotropy in
driving long-range magnetic order in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.

DyB12, an antiferromagnetic (AF) metal with Neel temperature TN = 16.3 K that
exhibits both cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions of the fcc crystal structure
and nanoscale electronic instabilities (dynamic charge stripes). Based on the
results obtained the magnetic field (H) vs temperature (T) phase diagrams have
been constructed. Moreover, from angle dependent magnetoresistance and
magnetization measurements the butterfly-type patterns of the H-phi magnetic
phase diagram in the (110) plane were created, which include a number of
different magnetic phases separated from each other by radial and circular
boundaries. Several positive and negative contributions to magnetoresistance
were separated and analyzed, providing arguments in favor of the important role
of the spin density wave 5d-component in the magnetic structure of AF state. We
argue that charge fluctuations in stripes are responsible for the suppression
of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) indirect exchange between the
nearest neighbored Dy3+ ions located along the same 110 directions, as these
dynamic charge stripes produce the magnetic phase diversity and the
butterfly-type anisotropy in DyB12.

### [83] [Spin-orbit crossover and the origin of magnetic torque in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15527)
*Mathias S. Scheurer,Harley D. Scammell*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents experimental findings on Cs3Sb5 where a nematic phase transition-like feature occurs above the CDW transition, but without a standard nematic signal. The authors propose interband ordering explains the observed behavior, challenging the role of charge density waves in this material.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the understanding of phase transitions in Cs3Sb5 by introducing a new candidate mechanism involving interband ordering, which could influence the interpretation of magnetic and material properties in 2D systems.

Method: The authors used a combination of torque, elastoresistance, and magnetic field measurements to analyze the material's magnetic behavior. They also employed theoretical modeling to propose their interband ordering mechanism.

Result: The experiments reveal a crossover at ~130K, explained by interband spin-orbit coupling and strain, without direct evidence of nematicity. The proposed model accounts for observed magnetic and torque behaviors and makes testable predictions.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that interband ordering, particularly interband spin-orbit coupling, plays a significant role in the magnetic behavior of Cs3Sb5, offering a new perspective on 2D materials' magnetic properties under different conditions.

Abstract: Recent experiments on the kagome metal Cs$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a curious phase
transition-like feature: a nematic magnetic torque response that abruptly sets
in at $T_\tau \approx 130$~K, above the known charge density wave transition at
$T_\text{CDW} \approx 100$~K. Counterintuitively, elastoresistance
measurements--a standard probe of nematicity--show no corresponding signal,
ruling out a nematic phase transition and placing strong constraints on
possible explanations. Beyond nematicity, the torque is paramagnetic for
in-plane magnetic field, while above a critical out-of-plane field, an in-plane
magnetisation appears, accompanied by hysteresis. We show that this combination
of features cannot be accounted for by charge density waves or intraband
magnetic order. Instead, we propose that interband ordering--via a
symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling and a time-reversal and spatial
symmetry-breaking interband order parameter--together with a background strain
field, consistent with typical experimental conditions, provides a natural
explanation; in our picture, the behaviour at $T_\tau$ is understood as a
crossover in the symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling strength. Our
theory accounts for the nematic magnetic torque, hysteresis, and the
transition-like onset at $T_\tau$, while also making testable predictions,
including strain-induced magnetisation. In doing so, it challenges the
prevailing view of the normal state.

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain
driven by a periodic magnetic field. Based on its instantaneous integrability
and inherent symmetry, we analytically study the magnetization and many-body
tunneling (MBT). Both of them exhibit periodicity distinct from the driving
period. The magnetization is shown to be independent of the initial state and
robust against perturbations, signaling the formation of discrete time crystal
(DTC) order. The DTC phase is found to be continuously tunable through magnetic
field. The system exhibits perfect MBT, manifested as exactly vanishing
Loschmidt echo (LE) thus divergent LE rate function at half period of the DTC.
Remarkably, the perfect MBT is independent of the system size, and can be
traced to an effective gap closure induced by quantum geometric effects.
Furthermore, the Loschmidt echo spectra entropy shows logarithmic-dependence on
system size, consistent with non-thermal nature of the DTC phase. We propose a
protocol using ultracold atoms for experimental realization of the DTC and MBT.

### [85] [Towards Understanding Prolate 4$f$ Monomers: Numerical Predictions and Experimental Validation of Electronic Properties and Slow Relaxation in a Muffin-shaped Er$^\mathrm{III}$ Complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15547)
*J. Arneth,C. Pachl,G. Greif,B. Beier,P. W. Roesky,K. Fink,R. Klingeler*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Er(III)-based trigonal-prismatic complex with unusual magnetic properties. By applying a magnetic field, the material exhibits slow relaxation of magnetization with two distinct relaxation paths. High-frequency EPR spectroscopy reveals specific g-factors and zero field splittings, suggesting the presence of complex magnetic orders, possibly related to giant magnetoresistance. The study uses ab-initio calculations to validate these findings, providing insights into the magnetic structure and behavior of the material.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work focuses on trigonal-prismatic Er(III) complexes, which are known for their interesting magnetic properties. The discovery of field-induced slow relaxation and SMM-silent behavior could have applications in spintronic devices and magnetic memory storage. This study contributes to understanding the relationship between geometry and magnetic ordering in such materials, potentially offering new insights for next-generation technologies.

Method: The researchers synthesized the compound [Er(PPTMP)₂(H₂O)][OTf]₃ and conducted X-ray crystallography to determine the structure. Magnetic measurements using magnetic susceptibility and zero-field EPR provided information on magnetic moments and splittings. High-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (H-F EPR) experiments revealed detailed g-factor and zero-field splitting data. Ab-initio spin-orbit configuration interaction (SO-CI) calculations were employed to correlate experimental data with theoretical predictions.

Result: The compound exhibits complex magnetic behavior. At a low magnetic field of 0.1 T, the magnetization shows slow relaxation with two distinct relaxation paths. The magnetic ground state is predominantly in an m ≈ ±9/2 configuration. The first excited magnetic doublet shows contributions from m ≈ ±5/2. The ground state g-tensor has an axial form with transversal components, leading to SMM-silent behavior under zero field. High-frequency EPR results align well with theoretical SO-CI calculations, highlighting the effectiveness of first-principles methods in interpreting EPR data.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of Er(III)-based trigonal-prismatic structures for exhibiting rich magnetic properties with applications in spintronic devices. The detailed characterization, particularly the SMM ( Silent Magnetic Moments) behavior, opens up new possibilities for future technological advancements in magnetic materials.

Abstract: We report the synthesis, crystal structure and magnetic properties of the
triply-capped, slightly distorted trigonal-prismatic complex
[Er(PPTMP)$_2$(H$_2$O)][OTf]$_3$ (PPTMP =
(4-(6-(1,10-phenanthrolin-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)methyl
pivalate) ($\mathbf{1}$). Complex $\mathbf{1}$ is shown to exhibit
field-induced slow relaxation of the magnetisation at $B = 0.1\,\mathrm{T}$ via
two distinct relaxation paths. Using tunable high-frequency/high-field electron
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we experimentally determine the effective
$g$-factors and zero field splittings of the two energetically lowest Kramers
doublets (KD). Our data reveal that the triply-capped, slightly distorted
trigonal-prismatic ligand field favours an $m \simeq \pm 9/2$ magnetic ground
state, while the main contribution to the first excited KD at $\Delta_{1
\rightarrow 2} = 780(5)\,\mathrm{GHz}$ is suggested to be $m \simeq \pm 5/2$.
The ground state $g$-tensor has generally axial form but hosts significant
transversal components, which we conclude to be the source of SMM-silent
behaviour in zero field. Our findings are backed up by ab-initio spin-orbit
configuration interaction calculations showing excellent agreement with the
experimental data.

Abstract: Electronic systems with quadratic band touchings, commonly found in two- and
three-dimensional materials such as Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, kagome
metals, HgTe, and pyrochlore iridates, have attracted significant interest
concerning the role of interactions in shaping their electronic properties.
However, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional
checkerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of
nearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path
quantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem
using a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small
lattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group
calculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an
improved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the
identification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in
tensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to
Hartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to
establish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice
rotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our
results show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the
checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three
interaction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator
at weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and
a site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.

### [87] [A new parametric observational study of $f(Q,B)$ gravity with modified chaplygin gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14251)
*Amit Samaddar,S. Surendra Singh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a modified gravity framework with f(Q,B) function and Modified Chaplygin Gas, successfully fitting cosmological parameters and showing accelerated expansion consistent with observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring modified gravity theories that can explain cosmic acceleration is crucial for understanding the nature of dark energy and the universe's expansion history. This paper employs a specific model to achieve that goal by fitting observational data.

Method: The authors use an f(Q,B) modified gravity model with Modified Chaplygin Gas equation of state. They derive the Hubble parameter analytically and employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with multiple cosmological datasets for parameter estimation.

Result: The best-fit parameters for the model are H0=72.22, A_s=0.696, α=0.0029, A=0.0038. The model shows a deceleration parameter transition at z≈0.946 and present-day q0=-0.789, indicating late-time accelerated expansion. The age of the universe is ≈13.53 Gyr, and current EoS ω0≈-0.691, consistent with dark energy observations.

Conclusion: The model provides a viable and cosmologically consistent explanation for the late-time acceleration, making it a promising candidate for dark energy studies and cosmic structure formation analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the cosmological dynamics of a modified gravity
framework based on the function $f(Q,B)=\delta Q^{2}+\beta B$, where $Q$
denotes the nonmetricity scalar and $B$ is the boundary term that relates $Q$
to the Ricci scalar. The matter sector is modeled using the Modified Chaplygin
Gas (MCG) with the equation of state $p=A\rho-\frac{B}{\rho^{\alpha}}$,
allowing the model to interpolate between early-time matter behavior and
late-time cosmic acceleration. By deriving an analytical expression for the
Hubble parameter $H(z)$, we perform a parameter estimation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques in conjunction with the latest cosmological
observations: $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, $15$ BAO data points, DESI
DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae compilation. The best-fit
values are obtained as $H_0 = 72.22^{+3.64}_{-4.46}$, $A_s =
0.696^{+0.082}_{-0.129}$, $\alpha = 0.0029^{+0.022}_{-0.021}$, and $A =
0.0038^{+0.071}_{-0.047}$. The deceleration parameter transitions at redshift
$z_{tr} \approx 0.946$, while the present-day value is $q_0 = -0.789$. The
model yields an age of the Universe $t_0 \approx 13.53$ Gyr and a present EoS
parameter $\omega_0 \approx -0.691$, which reflects the late-time acceleration
consistent with observational bounds. These results demonstrate that the MCG
scenario within $f(Q,B)$ gravity provides a viable and observationally
consistent framework for explaining the late-time accelerated expansion of the
Universe.

### [88] [The Sound of an Orbit: A Quantum Spectrum at the ISCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14254)
*Reggie C. Pantig,Ali Övgün*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical investigation of the excitation spectrum of detectors near the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole, revealing a distinct 'frequency comb' signature useful for studying quantum gravity effects in strong-field regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ISCO is a key concept in black hole physics, serving as a boundary for stable orbits. Understanding quantum effects near this region could provide insights into quantum gravity and the behavior of matter in extreme gravitational fields.

Method: The authors model an atom as an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar field in the Boulware vacuum. They compute the excitation rates for circular geodesic orbits at the ISCO using this model.

Result: They find a unique, non-thermal excitation spectrum characterized by a discrete 'frequency comb' of resonant peaks. These peaks' locations are tied to the ISCO orbital frequency, and their intensity increases as the orbit approaches the ISCO. The spectrum differs significantly from thermal spectra associated with static or infalling observers.

Conclusion: This new spectral signature offers a probe to study quantum vacuum effects in strong gravitational fields and distinguishes quantum phenomena for observers on different trajectories, with implications for interpreting accretion disk spectra and exploring quantum gravity connections.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum signature of the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO), a region of profound importance in black hole astrophysics. By modeling
an atom as an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in the
Boulware vacuum, we calculate the excitation rate for a detector following a
circular geodesic at the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole. In stark contrast
to the continuous thermal spectra associated with static or infalling
observers, our analysis reveals a unique, non-thermal excitation spectrum
characterized by a discrete "frequency comb" of sharp, resonant peaks. We show
that the locations of these peaks are determined by the orbital frequency at
the ISCO, while their intensity increases dramatically as the orbit approaches
this final stability boundary. This distinct spectral signature offers a novel
theoretical probe of the quantum vacuum in a strong-field gravitational regime
and provides a clear distinction between the quantum phenomena experienced by
observers on different trajectories. Our findings have potential implications
for interpreting the emission spectra from accretion disks and open new avenues
for exploring the connection between quantum mechanics and gravity.

### [89] [Accretion Disk Luminosity and Topological Characteristics for a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by a Hernquist Dark Matter Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14305)
*Luis M. Nieto,Farokhnaz Hosseinifar,Kuantay Boshkayev,Soroush Zare,Hassan Hassanabadi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines a Schwarzschild black hole in a Hernquist dark matter halo, exploring its remnant properties, accretion disk characteristics, and gravitational effects through various methods including calculations of orbital parameters, disk efficiency, and stability analysis using Lyapunov exponents and quasi-normal modes. The study highlights the significant influence of dark matter on the black hole's surroundings and the accretion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper combines black hole physics with dark matter halo models to study their mutual gravitational influences. This is relevant for understanding dark matter's role in black hole evolution, such as in galactic centers and potential experimental detection methods.

Method: Structures a model combining Schwarzschild black holes and Hernquist dark matter halos. Uses numerical simulations, analytical derivations, and tools like Lyapunov exponent calculation and quasi-normal mode analysis to assess changes in the accretion disk's physical properties, including luminosity and stability.

Result: The study finds that dark matter significantly alters the accretion disk's properties, affects efficiency, impacts quasi-normal modes, and influences the stability of the system. The results also show dependence on model parameters like halo concentration and radius to understand black hole dynamics.

Conclusion: Dark matter's gravitational influence on black holes leads to measurable effects on the accretion disk and surrounding spacetime. This provides a theoretical framework for tests with future telescopes or space missions focused on quantum gravity near black holes. The conclusions suggest implications for dark matter studies and potential experimental validations of black hole physics. These findings advance our understanding of dark matter's complex role in astrophysics and dark matter detection.

Abstract: In this work, we study some characteristics and gravitational signatures of
the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a Hernquist dark matter halo
(SBH-HDM). We determine the black hole's remnant radius and mass, which provide
useful residual information at the end of its evaporation. We then explore the
luminosity of the accretion disk from the SBH-HDM model. In this way, we
determine the key orbital parameters of the test particles within the accretion
disk, such as angular velocity, angular momentum, energy, and the radius of the
innermost stable circular orbit, based on the dark matter model parameters. We
also numerically estimate the accretion disk's efficiency in converting matter
into radiation. We also demonstrate that dark matter, which significantly
alters the geometry surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole, influences the
accretion disk's radiative flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and
spectral luminosity. The stability of a black hole spacetime is determined in
the eikonal regime. The Lyapunov exponent is also analyzed to quantify the
stability of the particle regime and to demonstrate the infall into or escape
from the black hole to infinity, as well as the quasi-normal modes. Finally,
some properties of black holes are studied from a topological perspective.

*Martin Bojowald,Manuel Diaz,Erick I. Duque*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Modified gravity theories are expanded by distinguishing between the spacetime metric and the dynamical fields, leading to new covariant modifications when considering perturbative inhomogeneities in a spatially flat cosmological framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the development of modified gravity theories by considering the emergence of the spacetime metric from field equations, which has implications for cosmological models, particularly early universe scenarios.

Method: The study involves extending previous symmetry-reduced models to perturbative inhomogeneous cases on a spatially flat cosmological background, focusing on how the metric emerges as a solution to field equations.

Result: New modifications are possible in modified gravity, maintaining the classical derivative order, providing a foundation for studying early-universe dynamics.

Conclusion: This approach opens new avenues for studying modified gravity in cosmological contexts while maintaining classical derivative order, suitable for detailed early universe studies.

Abstract: Emergent modified gravity has shown that the canonical formulation of general
relativity gives rise to a larger class of covariant modifications than
action-based approaches, so far in symmetry-reduced models. This outcome is
made possible by distinguishing between the space-time metric on a given
solution, and the basic field degrees of freedom in which equations of motion
are formulated. In this general treatment, the metric is no longer fundamental
but emerges after field equations and covariance conditions are solved. Here,
the results are extended to perturbative inhomogeneity on a spatially flat
cosmological background, showing that new modifications are possible while
maintaining the classical derivative order and setting the stage for dynamical
equations suitable for detailed studies of early-universe models.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of black hole solutions surrounded by
quintessence as defects possessing topological characteristics within the
thermodynamic space. By formulating a generalized off-shell free energy and
calculating the winding number for each black hole branch through the residues
of isolated first-order poles of characteristic function defined by this free
energy, the winding number reflects the local properties of black holes. The
topological number, being the sum of winding numbers for all black hole
branches, reflects global properties. Utilizing the residue method, we
discovered that the topological numbers for Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Kerr-AdS
black holes surrounded by quintessence are consistent with those not surrounded
by quintessence. Furthermore, 4D/5D Einstein-Gauss Bonnet black holes under a
quintessence field belong to the same topological class as Kerr black holes.
Thus both the rotation parameter and Gauss-Bonnet parameter in this background
field affect the topological number of the black hole. Importantly, the winding
numbers for generation and annihilation points can be calculated using the
residues of second-order poles of the characteristic function.

Abstract: The phase space of gravitational theories in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter
(AAdS) spacetimes consists of geometries, matter configurations, and their
conjugate momenta on a Cauchy surface, subject to the Hamiltonian, momentum,
and matter-gauge constraints. When a unique maximal volume slice exists in all
classical solutions of the bulk equations of motion, and the matter fields
satisfy certain conditions, we show that this phase space is physically
equivalent to an alternative phase space in which the Hamiltonian constraint is
replaced by the real Weyl-anomaly constraint, while the momentum and
matter-gauge constraints remain unchanged. A necessary requirement for a
functional of the metric and matter configurations to qualify as a valid
quantum gravity state is that it satisfies the operator gauge constraints.
Partition functions of certain conformal field theories with imaginary central
charge, defined on bulk Cauchy slices, satisfy these operator gauge constraints
and therefore provide candidate quantum gravity states in the alternative phase
space formulation.

TL;DR: The paper uses a Vaidya black hole model to show the time-dependent evolution of the black hole image, with a Vaidya Penrose diagram and semi-analytical ray tracing revealing facula movements in the brightness asymmetry over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Event Horizon Telescope's detection of the brightness asymmetry's time variability in M87* provides a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamic properties of black hole images, particularly in models like the Vaidya black hole which allow for mass inflow.

Method: The authors employ conformal transformations and a semi-analytical approach to study ray trajectories and radiation flux in a Vaidya black hole with an accretion disk. They introduce a new time coordinate, t_c, based on a mass function increasing with time, to analyze facula movements over time.

Result: The analysis reveals that as t_c increases, faculae on the observable plane undergo radial displacements, indicating the time-dependent evolution of the black hole image.

Conclusion: This study bridges theoretical models with observational data, offering a deeper understanding of the physics behind dynamic black hole images, particularly driven by the accretion disk's influence and time-dependent mass accretion in the Vaidya model.

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope's 2024 observations report a shift in the
position angle of the brightness asymmetry in M87*, revealing time variability
in the black hole's image. In this analysis, we investigate the time-dependent
of a Vaidya black hole. By introducing a mass function that increases linearly
with time, along with a conformal transformation, we derive the conformal
Vaidya metric and define a new time coordinate $t_c$. Using the semi-analytical
approach, we analyze the ray trajectories and radiation flux of the Vaidya
black hole in the background of a thin accretion disk. We discuss how the
observed flux in the Vaidya spacetime evolves as a function of the new time
coordinate $t_c$. The results show that the facula on the observable plane
undergoes radial displacement as $t_c$ increases, revealing the time-dependent
evolution of black hole images.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrum of the Regge poles (RPs), which are the
counterparts of quasinormal modes, in a draining bathtub vortex within a
two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We study the gapped
excitations of the condensate with the spatially dependent energy gap term
using a spatially tunable Rabi coupling, which will be treated as a
perturbation. This model serves as an analogue of a rotating black hole
surrounded by an environmental mass shell. We first compute the semiclassical
scattering amplitude with the spatially independent mass effect due to the
orbital interference. In the case of the mass-shell, bifurcation of the
spectrum is observed, resulting in the destabilization of the RPs. We also
study the migration of RPs by shifting the bump position. Our results show that
the RPs of the co-rotating modes exhibit greater stability than those of the
counter-rotating modes. Large migration and overtaking jumps of the overtone
(fundamental RP) leave an imprint on the scattering amplitude at small (large)
scattering angles. This can be observed in the scattering interference pattern
in experiments.

Motivation: Research into alternative gravity theories to explain astrophysical phenomena, particularly compact objects, suggests this paper explores compactness and density limits.

Method: Assuming quadratic non-metricity gravity, studied compact objects through field equations with fluid components to analyze density and pressure properties.

Result: Models are consistent with radio pulsar data. Core and surface densities exceed nuclear saturation. Radial sound speed below conformal upper bound.

Conclusion: Paper supports quadratic gravity as a viable alternative in explaining deviations in compactness limits compared to General Relativity.

Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects are studied in the context of quadratic
non-metricity gravity. The solutions to the gravitational field equations,
which include fluid components, are analyzed to investigate the density and
pressure properties of radio pulsars. It is explicitly demonstrated that the
theoretically stable models are consistent with astronomical data, due to the
geometric features of the quadratic component. Furthermore, it is shown that,
in contrast to the compactness limits of black holes in general relativity, the
core density can significantly exceed the density at which nuclear saturation
occurs, and the surface density can also surpass the value of nuclear
saturation. Additionally, it is found that the radial sound speed remains below
the conformal upper bound for sound velocity established by perturbative
quantum chromodynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  research on black hole accretion disks and their interaction with external magnetic fields is significant for understanding astrophysical phenomena, such as quasars and active galactic nuclei. Improved models in this study contribute to detection and characterization of such systems through their emitted radiation characteristics. 

Method: 研究采用数值方法，在Kerr磁致 INFO空间中近开普勒运动的条件下，通过迭代、有限差分和插值方法，获得了时 República particles的能、角动量和角速度参数。利用这些参数，模拟了旋盘的辐射能流密度、温度和黑体光谱。研究在不同的自转参数、观测倾角和磁场强度下进行了计算。通过数值计算，研究者还找到了当磁Field与黑洞角动量对齐时的光谱特征，并确定了磁环境的阈值。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了Novikov-Thorne模型到非积分轴对称空间，并首次揭示了外部磁Field与盘属性之间的直接关系。这为通过旋盘辐射特性研究磁环境提供了重要理论依据，将对理解和研究类星体等天体的物理机制产生深远影响。

Abstract: The Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model is widely employed in astrophysics,
yet computing its blackbody spectrum theoretically requires analytical
expressions for the orbital parameters -- specific energy, angular momentum,
and angular velocity -- of the constituent timelike particles, a task extremely
challenging in non-integrable curved spacetimes. In this work, we numerically
obtain these orbital parameters for quasi-Keplerian motion in Kerr spacetime
with an asymptotically uniform magnetic field using iterative,
finite-difference, and interpolation methods, enabling simulations of the
disk's energy flux density, temperature, and blackbody spectra across diverse
spin parameters, observational inclinations, and magnetic field strengths. We
demonstrate that when the magnetic field aligns with the black hole's angular
momentum, the disk's radiation positively correlates with field strength, while
spectral analysis for our specific black hole mass and accretion rate reveals a
conservative detectable threshold of $1.0638 \times 10^{-9}$ T for ambient
magnetic fields. This study not only extends the Novikov-Thorne model to
non-integrable axisymmetric spacetimes but also establishes the first direct
relationship between external magnetic fields and disk properties, providing
critical theoretical support for future magnetic environment studies through
disk radiation observations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Abstract discusses 5D Einstein-Maxwell solutions, selecting mirror stars with q²>3m², comparing with black holes, and studying perturbations to determine stability, with results conflicting with literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is in the field of theoretical physics, specifically in higher-dimensional gravity and black hole solutions. It focuses on mirror stars as models for objects that could potentially reflect signals, which is of interest in understanding exotic astrophysical objects and testing theories beyond General Relativity.

Method: The authors analyze static, spherically symmetric solutions in 5D Einstein-Maxwell theory. They employ perturbation theory to study the stability of these solutions under time-dependent perturbations, focusing on comparing the cases where the magnetic charge q is greater than or less than 3 times the Schwarzschild mass m squared. The results are compared to previous findings, leading to discrepancies in the literature.

Result: The analysis identifies specific parameter ranges (q² > 3m² for mirror stars versus q² < 3m² for black holes) and their respective stabilities, with stability regions differing from prior studies.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the stability criteria for mirror stars and black holes in 5D Einstein-Maxwell theory differ from earlier reported results, likely due to the perturbation method applied.

Abstract: We discuss static, spherically symmetric solutions to the 5D Einstein-Maxwell
equations (belonging to wide classes of multidimensional solutions known at
least from the 1990s) and select among them those which must observationally
look like local objects whose surface reflects back particles or signals
getting there, the so-called mirror stars (also called ``topological stars'' by
some authors). Their significant parameters are the Schwarzschild mass $m$ and
the magnetic charge $q$, such that $q^2 > 3m^2$. For comparison, we also
discuss their black hole counterparts for which $q^2 < 3m^2$. For both these
objects, we study spherically symmetric time-dependent perturbations and
determine the stability regions in their parameter spaces. Our stability
results disagree with some of those previously announced in the literature.

Abstract: In this study, we model a spin-network in loop quantum gravity as a regular
tetrahedral lattice, applying lattice physics techniques to study its structure
and vertex dynamics. Using the area eigenvalue, $A\propto 8\pi l_P^2$, we
derive a lattice constant $a = 2.707\,l_P$ and construct a vertex Hamiltonian
incorporating a Lennard-Jones potential, zero-point energy, and simple harmonic
oscillations. A foliation approach enforces the Wheeler-DeWitt constraint via
locally non-zero Hamiltonians that globally cancel. Graviton-like perturbations
(treated here as spin-0 bosons) modify the vertex energy spectrum, with
variational analysis suggesting twelve coherent excitations per vertex. This
model frames flat spacetime as a graviton-rich lattice while enforcing a
Brownian-like stochastic picture for the gravitons, and offers a basis for
extension into curved quantum geometries.

Motivation: 文章讨论了磁星的引力波辐射，致力于探索这一现象的科学可行性，以及探测方法的可能性。

Method: 使用三维静态的力自由、广义相对论解，分别考虑单极和单极加双极磁场，评估了引力波波长。

Result: 空间基波干涉仪可能检测到距离约kpc范围内的 slowly-rotating 磁星引力波，特别是当磁场强度达到 1e15 G时。

Conclusion: 文章认为，通过精确测量引力波强度，可以直接推断磁星表面磁场，不受内部电流的影响。这为未来空间干涉仪探测提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The intense magnetic fields inferred from magnetars suggest they may be
strong gravitational-wave emitters. Although emissions due to hydromagnetic
deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields
also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free
energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent
relative to the potential state, implying that the gravitational-wave
luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts
`universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the
near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents. Using a
suite of three-dimensional, force-free, general-relativistic solutions for
dipole and dipole-plus-quadrupole fields, we find that space-based
interferometers may enable marginal detections out to $\lesssim$ kpc distances
for slowly-rotating magnetars with fields of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G.

Motivation: 研究者为了理解量子效应对引力物体紧凑性的影响，通过GUP理论进行建模，结合实验和理论界限，得出结论。

Method: 分析现有的GUP框架，引用实验约束条件，数学推导得出界的上界与GUP参数的关系，使用gravitation和quantum mechanics的知识。

Result: 发现大自引力系统（如星系等）的紧凑度上限主要受GUP参数影响，且这一上限为1左右，而存在黑洞的情况下施加更严格的约束。

Conclusion: 使用广义不确定性原理提升理解自引力系统在量子间引力影响下的最大紧凑度，尤其是黑洞的存在对紧凑度的限制更为显著。

Abstract: We analyse how different Generalised Uncertainty Principles could place
bounds on the compactness of self-gravitating systems. By considering existing
experimental bounds on the relevant parameters, we conclude that the
compactness of large astrophysical objects is bounded above by the inverse of
the GUP parameter, which would naturally be of order one. Conversely, the
existence of black holes imposes stronger bounds on those parameters.

TL;DR: 引文全面分析了不同时态下蒸发性 wormhole 的解决方案，特别是在 Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) 和 de Sitter 背景下的情况，及其在不同引力理论中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific research often requires a deep understanding of theoretical models and their implications for various physical scenarios. This paper explores the development of wormhole solutions in different gravitational theories and backgrounds, which is essential for advancing our knowledge of spacetime structures and their potential role in cosmology.

Method: The paper reviews and synthesizes existing research on evolving wormhole solutions, emphasizing their formulation in both general relativity and alternative theories of gravity. It focuses on time-dependent geometries and their interaction with cosmological backgrounds and modified gravity theories. The analysis involves mathematical modeling of wormhole spacetimes and exploring their energy conditions.

Result: The review identifies specific conditions under which evaporating wormholes can satisfy the null and weak energy conditions, showing how these configurations can be integrated into cosmological models. This provides a theoretical framework for understanding localized spacetime structures in expanding universes and their implications for quantum gravity and dark energy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that evolving wormhole solutions offer a promising approach to studying spacetime topology, energy conditions, and their connections to cosmological models, particularly in modified gravity theories. It emphasizes the need for further research to explore the physical implications and potential observational signatures of these solutions.

Abstract: Wormholes are non-trivial topological structures that arise as exact
solutions to Einstein's field equations, theoretically connecting distinct
regions of spacetime via a throat-like geometry. While static traversable
wormholes necessarily require exotic matter that violates the classical energy
conditions, subsequent studies have sought to minimize such violations by
introducing time-dependent geometries embedded within cosmological backgrounds.
This review provides a comprehensive survey of evolving wormhole solutions,
emphasizing their formulation within both general relativity and alternative
theories of gravity. We explore key developments in the construction of
non-static wormhole spacetimes, including those conformally related to static
solutions, as well as dynamically evolving geometries influenced by scalar
fields. Particular attention is given to the wormholes embedded into
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes and de Sitter
backgrounds, where the interplay between the cosmic expansion and wormhole
dynamics is analyzed. We also examine the role of modified gravity theories,
especially in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which enable the realization of
traversable wormholes supported by effective stress-energy tensors that do not
violate the null or weak energy conditions. By systematically analyzing a wide
range of time-dependent wormhole solutions, this review identifies the specific
geometric and physical conditions under which wormholes can evolve consistently
with the null and weak energy conditions. These findings clarify how such
configurations can be naturally integrated into cosmological models governed by
general relativity or modified gravity, thereby contributing to a deeper
theoretical understanding of localized spacetime structures in an expanding
universe.

*Saurav Samanta,Bibhas Ranjan Majhi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates how entropy of matter under strong gravity is influenced by the cross-sectional area of the system, not the volume, and extends this analysis to a Newtonian monoatomic gas and higher-dimensional scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the impact of strong gravitational fields on the entropy of matter using a Newtonian framework, particularly emphasizing the cross-sectional area's role.

Method: The study calculates the entropy of a monoatomic gas under uniform strong gravity, avoiding reliance on event horizons, and applies the findings to a two-dimensional relativistic gas without gravity.

Result: Entropy is shown to depend on the system's cross-sectional area, supporting the idea that the effective degrees of freedom under strong gravity relate to this area rather than volume.

Conclusion: The research suggests that under strong gravitational conditions, the volume doesn't significantly affect entropy, emphasizing the cross-sectional area's influence on the system's microstates.

Abstract: Entropy of matter in a very strong gravity depends on cross-sectional area of
the container of the system -- is being further bolstered by calculating
entropy of a monoatomic gas kept under uniform strong gravity at Newtonian
scale. This bypasses the earlier analysis where existence of horizon is
crucial. Also the extensivity of this entropy has been discussed in the light
of the same of a two-space dimensional ultra-relativistic non-interacting gas
without gravity. The whole analysis, as far as entropy is concerned, indicates
that under strong gravity the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system are
effectively contributed by the cross-sectional area of the system.

Conclusion: 无曲率但有高扭转的时空可以精确调控光的传播，提供模拟不寻常几何的新平台，适用于模拟引力系统和光子材料。

Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of null trajectories and scalar
wave propagation in a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime containing a spiral
dislocation-a topological defect characterized by torsion in the absence of
curvature. For null rays, the torsion parameter $\beta$ modifies the affine
structure, enforcing a finite turning radius $r_{\min} = \sqrt{b^2 - \beta^2}$
and inducing a torsion-mediated angular deflection that decreases monotonically
with increasing $\beta$. The photon trajectory deviates from the
curvature-induced lensing paradigm, exhibiting a purely topological exclusion
zone around the defect core. In the wave regime, we recast the Helmholtz
equation into a Schr\"odinger-like form and extract a spatially and spectrally
dependent refractive index $n^2(r,k)$. This index asymptotically approaches
unity at large distances, but diverges strongly and negatively near the
dislocation core due to torsion-induced geometric terms. The resulting
refractive index profile governs the transition from propagating to evanescent
wave behavior, with low-frequency modes experiencing pronounced localization
and suppression. Our findings reveal that torsion alone, absent any curvature,
can act as a geometric regulator of both classical and quantum propagation,
inducing effective anisotropy, frequency filtering, and confinement. This
framework provides a rare exact realization of light-matter interaction in a
torsion-dominated background, with potential applications in analog gravity
systems and photonic metamaterials engineered to replicate non-Riemannian
geometries.

### [104] [Constraint on gravitational-wave polarizations for space-based detectors with time-delay interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14870)
*Tong Jiang,Chunyu Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors investigate the constraining capability of space-based gravitational wave detectors on extra polarizations, employing second-generation TDI. They find that the tensor mode constraints are degraded when TDI is used, but the vector mode constraints are better. Detectability is enhanced with TDI, yet the improvement is less for vector modes due to inclination dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detectors are crucial for testing theories of gravity, and understanding their constraining power on extra polarization modes is important for validating alternative theories. The use of TDI in space-based detectors is relevant as it helps cancel noise, but prior studies have shown mixed results on performance.

Method: The authors used the parametrized post-Einstein (ppE) waveform framework to model the signals and apply second-generation TDI. They compared the constraints on tensor, vector, and scalar modes under TDI with other interferometer configurations.

Result: Conditional on low frequency, TDI reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the tensor mode, degrading constraints. Vector mode constraints are improved, but scalar modes are less affected. Inclination dependence impacts detectability aspects.

Conclusion: This analysis suggests that while TDI enhances certain constraints, the overall lifting of detection prospects for extra polarization modes is limited, especially for tensor modes, which are more impactful for testing gravity theories. Future research may focus on combining TDI with other techniques or exploring detector configurations that utilize inclination.

Abstract: Probing extra polarizations in gravitational waves (GWs) with space-based
detectors is the most direct method for testing theories of gravity. In this
paper, by employing the second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) to
cancel out the laser frequency noise in a rotating and flexing configuration
with arm lengths varying linearly in time, we study the detectors' constraint
ability on extra polarizations, and explore the impacts of TDI on the
constraint of polarizations. Working in the parametrized post-Einstein (ppE)
waveform framework, we find that the constraints on extra polarizations are
significantly weaker than those for the tensor mode. For the tensor mode, the
constraint ability for the detectors scales with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
At low frequency, due to signal cancellation effects, the SNR registered is
lower for the detectors with TDI method than that with the simplified equal-arm
Michelson interferometer method. Therefore, tensor-mode constraints are
degraded when TDI is applied. Although the direct detection of extra
polarizations remains challenging, the constraint ability of the space-based
detectors on the vector mode is better than the scalar modes. Besides, the
detectability on extra polarizations will be enhanced with TDI, and the
improvement of the constraint on the vector mode is less than scalar modes due
to the inclination-dependent waveforms.

Abstract: We propose a new, general form for a pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potential
(PNP), expressed as a series of Paczy\'nski-Wiita-like functions with the
addition of increasing negative powers of $r$ with arbitrary coefficients. We
present a procedure for determining these coefficients to construct a custom
PNP that replicates key features of Schwarzschild geodesics for a test particle
near a black hole. As an example, we construct potentials set to reproduce (I)
the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit at the $r=6$ (geometric
units), with the correct infall velocity for small deviations (on the geodesic
universal infall), (II) the periapsis advance at large distances, and (III) the
presence of a marginally bound circular orbit with specific angular momentum
$L=4$, and the periapsis advance of parabolic orbits close to it. We compare
the performance of our examples against the Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential and
other existing potentials. Finally, we discuss the limitations and advantages
of our formulation.

### [106] [Smooth binary evolution from wide resonances in boson clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15110)
*Giovanni Maria Tomaselli*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the potential role of ultralight scalar clouds around rotating black holes in modifying the dynamics of compact binaries, affecting gravitational waveforms. The study examines orbital resonances and cloud ionization, derives an effective method to handle wide resonances beyond the binary's frequency chirp, calculates an upper limit for surviving cloud mass, and explores the accumulation of high-energy bound states. The findings suggest that these resonances should be considered in modeling boson clouds for gravitational wave predictions, showing both agreement and discrepancies with previous studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the intriguing possibility that quantum effects near black holes could influence gravitational wave signals, potentially altering astrophysical and cosmological observations. Understanding these effects may deepen our knowledge of dark matter, high-energy physics, and gravitational wave astronomy.

Method: The study employs an effective treatment method for resonances in quantum mechanical systems with a finite decay width. It uses Newtonian gravity-based calculations for orbital resonances and bound states, then cross-compare these with relativistic models to identify similarities and differences in the resulting waveforms.

Result: The analysis reveals that resonances from scalar clouds can significantly influence the inspiral and merger dynamics of compact binaries, leading to waveform changes. By introducing an upper mass bound for surviving clouds, it provides a framework for modeling these effects more accurately. The comparison between Newtonian and relativistic results highlights both consistent features and areas where relativistic effects become more pronounced.

Conclusion: The research underscores the necessity of incorporating resonances in scalar boson cloud models to improve the Accuracy of gravitational wave predictions. While certain features align with earlier findings, others reveal the limitations of current modeling approaches, emphasizing the need for refined theories and more comprehensive modeling of these quantum phenomena in the vicinity of black holes.

Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes.
These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform
through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances
involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for
resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the
utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass
surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the
accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely
many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth
out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to
the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent
relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as
discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate
resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.

Abstract: We propose a new dark energy (DE) model from four parameter generalized
entropy function of apparent horizon in a spatially flat universe. Such kind of
generalized entropy is able to generalize all the known entropies proposed so
far, for suitable representations of the entropic parameters. It turns out that
the scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the
sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM
model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of
present Hubble parameter for certain range of entropic parameter(s) leading to
a possible resolution of Hubble tension issue. We confront the scenario with
CC, PantheonPlus+SH0ES, DESI DR1 and compressed Planck likelihood datasets,
which clearly depicts the phenomenological viability of the present model for
some best fitted values of entropic parameter(s) that are indeed consistent
with the resolution of Hubble tension.

expression for the deflection angle in terms of elliptic integrals. Our results
confirm that the deflection angle decreases with increasing impact parameter,
in agreement with classical predictions of gravitational lensing. The influence
of the scalar field, characterized by the coupling constant, shows a nontrivial
effect: while moderate values of the coupling constant initially enhance light
bending, further increases lead to a suppression of the deflection in the
strong-field regime due to modifications in spacetime geometry. Comparative
analysis among the Schwarzschild, Kiselev, and Hairy Kiselev black holes
indicates that the presence of a quintessential field tends to enhance the
deflection, whereas the scalar hair component reduces it. These findings
underscore the significant role of scalar fields and exotic matter
distributions in shaping light propagation in a modified gravity scenario.

Abstract: The numerical waveforms for the extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) require
a huge amount of homogeneous solutions of the Teukolsky equation in the
frequency domain. The calculation accuracy and efficiency of the homogeneous

paper, we propose a new numerical method based on the analytical series
expansion which is most efficient for computing the homogeneous solutions with
very high accuracy and a wider frequency range compared with the existing
methods. Our new method is definitely useful for constructing the waveform
templates of EMRIs.

*Adrian Abac,Felip Ramis Vidal,Marta Colleoni,Anna Puecher,Alejandra Gonzalez,Tim Dietrich*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper extends the NRTidalv3 model with higher-mode corrections for tidal phase calculations, integrates these with various mass ratio models, validates the models against numerical simulations and tidal models, and applies them in parameter estimation for binary systems and GW170817, finding consistent results with prior studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave analysis requires accurate models for reliable waveform determination, and this paper addresses enhancing tidal modeling to improve such analyses for compact binaries and neutron star mergers.

Method: The authors extended NRTidalv3 to include higher-mode tidal effects, connected it to different waveform models, and validated via numerical simulations and parameter estimation on binary systems including GW170817.

Result: Improved tidal models with higher-mode corrections lead to accurate parameter estimation and consistency with prior results.

Conclusion: The enhanced tidal models enhance waveform accuracy, particularly useful for next-gen detectors, and their application in parameterization proves their reliability for neutron star mergers and high-mass ratio binaries.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable gravitational waveform models are crucial in
determining the properties of compact binary mergers. In particular,
next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will require more accurate
waveforms to avoid biases in the analysis. In this work, we extend the recent
NRTidalv3 model to account for higher-mode corrections in the tidal phase
contributions for binary neutron star systems. The higher-mode, multipolar
NRTidalv3 model is then attached to several binary-black-hole baselines, such
as the phenomenological IMRPhenomXHM and IMRPhenomXPHM models, and the
effective-one-body-based model SEOBNRv5HM_ROM. We test the performance and
validity of the newly developed models by comparing them with
numerical-relativity simulations and other tidal models. Finally, we employ
them in parameter estimation analyses on simulated signals from both
comparable-mass and high-mass-ratio systems, as well as on the
gravitational-wave event GW170817, for which we find consistent results with
respect to previous analyses.

Result: 文章提出了一个基于地球-月球系统的统一 lunar 时间框架，并提出了一个长期变长的转换系数。

Conclusion: 独立于地球的 lunar 时间体系可以通过精确比较地球-月球时间来建立，且该系数的变化趋势可以被测量和预测。

Abstract: Lunar time metrology necessitates a unified temporal framework beyond Earth,
requiring an independent lunar system for timekeeping, dissemination, and
calendrics. Recent American publications define Lunar Coordinate Time (LTC)
within relativity and propose a Terrestrial Time (TT) to LTC conversion
formula. However, this formula's derivation and assumptions are contested. The
complex dynamics within the solar system can be simplified by decomposing
relationships into hierarchical wide-area (external problem) and local-area
(internal problem) levels. Grounded in the symmetry and conservation laws of
physics, Einstein's general relativity emphasizes two key principles: (i) Equal
weighting: Relationships among multi-level coordinate systems are independent
and self-similar (analogous to fractals). (ii) *Locality*: The laws of physics
retain invariant forms only in local coordinate systems. Specifically, a
non-rotating system corresponds to the Frenet frame along a particle's
geodesic. Preserving physical law invariance requires restricting rotating
references strictly to the local domain; defining the orientation of an
Earth-centered system using distant celestial bodies violates general
relativity's locality principle. This work derives the relationship between
coordinate time and proper time. Using the Earth-Moon system as an
intermediary, it obtains a simplified transformation formula between LTC and
TT. An independent and universal lunar standard time framework is proposed.
Crucially, the derived coordinate time transformation coefficient exhibits
long-term secular variation. This variation can be measured and predicted
through precise Earth-Moon time comparisons.

### [112] [Can Static Black Holes in Massive Gravity Serve as Candidates for Aschenbach-Like Phenomena?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15563)
*Mohammad Ali S. Afshar,Jafar Sadeghi,Tahereh Azizi,A. S. Sefiedgar*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the Aschenbach effect, traditionally observed in rotating spacetimes caused by frame dragging and extreme curvature. The paper extends this effect to static black holes by introducing stable photon spheres and explores its possibility in Massive Gravity theories as an observable signature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the intriguing idea that relativistic effects, often tied to rotation, might be explainable by extreme spacetime curvature alone. Investigating this presents opportunities to deepen our understanding of black hole physics and gravitational effects in alternative theories.

Method: The study utilizes semi-analytical methods in static spacetimes and numerical simulations in two-dimensional and spherically symmetric cases to analyze the Aschenbach-like phenomena.

Result: The analysis reveals that static black holes can mimic the Aschenbach effect when a stable photon sphere exists. Simulations in Massive Gravity theories demonstrate comparable dynamics, supporting the phenomenon as an observable signature.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Aschenbach-like behavior is not exclusive to rotating spacetimes and can be observed in static configurations, with implications for testing General Relativity and alternative gravitational theories through astrophysical observations.

Abstract: The Aschenbach effect is widely regarded as a manifestation of two
quintessential relativistic features: frame dragging and extreme spacetime
curvature. Traditionally associated with rotating geometries, this
non-monotonic behavior in orbital angular velocity challenges Newtonian
intuition. In our previous work, however, we demonstrated that this velocity
irregularity is not exclusive to spinning spacetimes. Specifically, we showed
that the presence of a stable minimum in the gravitational potential,
corresponding to a stable photon sphere, can reproduce Aschenbach-like behavior
in static black holes as well. This observation suggests that, even in the
absence of rotational frame dragging, curvature alone (if encoded through
appropriate geometric extrema) may be sufficient to induce non-monotonic
velocity profiles.
  In this study, we build upon that foundation to investigate whether black
hole architectures in theories of Massive Gravity can inherently support the
emergence of Aschenbach-like phenomena. Furthermore, can this Aschenbach-like
phenomenon in static configurations be considered as an observable signature in
the dynamics of general relativity, similar to the original Aschenbach effect
in rotating spacetimes?

Abstract: We investigate gravitational waveforms from the inspiral phase of compact
binary systems within the framework of quadratic gravity and map their
deviations from general relativity into the parameterized post-Einstein (PPE)
formalism to constrain the theory parameters. Quadratic gravity generically
includes a massive spin-2 ghost, which leads to ill-defined energy and angular
momentum fluxes. Following earlier proposals, we remove these unphysical
features by imposing a constraint on the massive spin-2 mode, restricting it to
propagate only the same polarizations of general relativity. Within the
quadrupole approximation, we derive the radiative degrees of freedom, including
massless and massive tensor modes, as well as a massive scalar field. Using the
stationary phase approximation, we compute the Fourier-domain waveform of the
massless tensor modes and extract the phase corrections. For small deviations
from general relativity, we show that both the scalar and massive tensor modes
can be consistently embedded into the PPE framework, extending previous results
that considered only scalar fields. We derive updated constraints on the
parameters of quadratic gravity, finding bounds improved by three orders of
magnitude compared to existing limits. Finally, we present forecasts for the
sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope to these deviations.

### [115] [Towards relativistic inspirals into black holes surrounded by matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15720)
*Lukáš Polcar,Vojtěch Witzany*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  article presents a new theoretical framework for modeling extreme mass ratio inspirals of compact objects into massive black holes surrounded by astrophysical matter environments. It uses a two-parameter perturbation approach leading to a modified Teukolsky equation. The framework includes a thin matter shell model and non-separable boundary conditions, impacting gravitational waveform calculations and incorporating the shell's oscillations into the flux. The method enhances our understanding of tidal environments and supports future waveform computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of incorporating matter environments into gravitational wave modeling, which is crucial for future space-based detectors like LISA. Extreme mass ratio inspirals are key sources for these detectors, and understanding their dynamics in realistic astrophysical settings is essential for accurate waveform predictions. The motivation is driven by the need to improve the precision of gravitational wave models to match the sensitivity and capabilities of LISA.

Method: The authors employ a two-parameter perturbation expansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter, leading to a modified Teukolsky equation. They model the environment with a thin matter shell and consider non-rotating black holes. The method introduces piecewise type D spacetime and addresses non-separable boundary conditions, resulting in mode mixing. Oscillations of the matter shell contribute to the flux. The framework provides a theoretical basis for computing inspirals and waveforms.

Result: The framework leads to a modified Teukolsky equation, effective non-separable boundary conditions, mode mixing, and oscillations in the matter shell contributing to flux. This results in a deeper understanding of global gravitational radiation dynamics in tidal environments and supports accurate waveform modeling.

Conclusion: This study offers a comprehensive theory for modeling extreme mass ratio inspirals in environments with matter. It advances the understanding of gravitational radiation in tidal environments and lays the groundwork for future computations of inspirals and waveforms, improving future gravitational wave data analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals, compact objects spiraling into massive black
holes, represent key sources for future space-based gravitational-wave
detectors such as LISA. The inspirals will occur within rich astrophysical
environments containing gravitating matter. Motivated by this, we develop a
fully relativistic framework for inspirals under the gravitational influence of
matter environments. Our approach employs a two-parameter perturbation
expansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter. This yields a
modified Teukolsky equation capturing the leading cross-order. We then
implement a simple pole-dipole approximation of an axisymmetric environment
through a thin matter shell and restrict to non-rotating black holes. As a
result, we obtain a piecewise type D spacetime. This enables the use of
Teukolsky-based methods while accounting for junction physics. The presence of
the matter shell leads to effectively non-separable boundary conditions for the
Teukolsky scalar and introduces mode mixing between adjacent multipoles.
Additionally, the shell oscillates under the wave perturbation of the inspiral,
contributing to the overall flux. The framework provides novel insights into
the global dynamics of gravitational radiation in tidal environments.
Furthermore, it represents a complete theoretical foundation for a future
computation of inspirals and waveforms in our environmental model.

Abstract: Bulk viscous cosmological models is presented in the teleparallel ($F(T)$,
where $T$ denotes torsion) gravity. In the teleparallel gravity, the Lagrangian
of the gravitational action contains a general function $F(T)= T+ f(T)=(1+
\gamma) T+\alpha (-T)^n$, where $\gamma$, $n$ and $\alpha$ are dimensional
constants. Cosmological solutions in Eckart theory and Truncated Israel Stewart
theory are talked about in $F(T)=(1+ \gamma) T+\alpha (-T)^n$ gravity form
which is one of the most generalized gravity form in the torsional gravity. The
substantial and geometrical prospective of the cosmological models in Eckart
theory and Truncated Israel Stewart theory in $F(T)$ gravity are deliberated
for flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space time. Dynamical analysis of the fixed
points of exponential expansion in $F(T)$ with bulk viscous cosmological models
are studied here. The characteristics of the various cosmological parameters
such as bulk viscous pressure, energy density, scale factor, Hubble parameter
and entropy evolution are studied in Power law and Exponential models.
Stability analysis of the exponential models are also argued with cosmic growth
in the relevant theories by using directional plots. The cosmological models
are supported by observations results.

Motivation: Understanding dark matter through quantum gravity effects in cosmology

Method: Uses the no-boundary proposal and instanton formalism to model the decay of de Sitter space into black holes

Result: The decay results in 10^60 Planck-sized black hole remnants within the Hubble horizon, matching the dark matter density

Conclusion: This provides a novel explanation for dark matter through quantum gravity processes in the early universe.

Abstract: One of the major problems in quantum gravity research is the lack of signals
at the reach of present or near-future experimental facilities. In this paper,
we show that this is not the case. Contrary to previous claims, the quantum
decay of de Sitter space into black hole spacetimes can be significant even
after inflation and can be observed on galactic scales. Using the instanton
formalism within the no-boundary proposal for a class of short-scale,
quantum-gravity-improved black holes, we show that de Sitter space decay would
result in the production of $10^{60}$ stable Planck-size black hole remnants
within the current Hubble horizon, which is the number required to explain dark

Abstract: We investigate the inflation for the quartic hilltop model via a certain type
of modified gravity. Precisely, we analyze the $F(\phi) T$ term in the
Einstein's gravity to examine the quartic hilltop inflation model. $T$ is the
trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and $\phi$ is the inflaton field. Next, we
calculate the inflation dynamics for the foregoing model and obtain the
slow-roll parameters, i.e., the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$'' and the
tensor-to-scale ratio ``$r$'', which these parameters exhibit high sensitivity
to the $F(\phi) T$ term. This modified form of the gravity is not only in
accordance with the predictions of the original model but also allows for
better prediction of the Planck/BICEP/Keck data.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: This paper discusses the creation and stability of quantized vortices in polaritonic fluids using a driven-dissipative system. They observed both negative and positive energy modes, which allows for the stabilization of these vortices. This phenomenon is similar to those found in quantum fluids and astrophysical vortices, suggesting universal amplification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation appears to stem from the interest in understanding and controlling the behavior of quantized vortices in different quantum systems, particularly in light-based fluids. The use of a driven-dissipative system allows for the creation of stable vortices, which is a significant advancement as vortices are typically unstable and difficult to maintain in quantum environments.

Method: The researchers employed a driven-dissipative approach with polaritonic fluids of light. They likely used experimental techniques involving lasers and photonic crystals to create and measure the vortices. The system's dynamics were probably analyzed by measuring the collective excitations, including energy modes, at different radii in the fluid.

Result: The main findings include the observation of both negative energy modes at the vortex core and positive energy modes at larger radii in the same system. This coexistence is crucial for stabilizing the vortices. Additionally, the system configurations showed similarities with vortices in quantum fluids and astrophysical compact objects, suggesting a universal mechanism for vortex stabilization and amplification.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the driven-dissipative polaritonic fluid system successfully stabilizes quantized vortices. This achievement opens new avenues for studying universal vortex phenomena across various quantum systems, potentially leading to advancements in fields such as quantum computing and astrophysics.

Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum
mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative
studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices
are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However,
here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to
create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of
collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and
positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency
normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize
the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We
observe common features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other
rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the
study of universal amplification phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the formation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases using dipole-dipole interactions.

Method: The researchers used molecular Bose-Einstein condensates, induced dipole-dipole interactions with varying strengths and anisotropies using microwave fields, and observed the resulting droplet structures and phase transitions in experiments.

Result: Formation of self-bound droplets and arrays, dynamic phase transitions, and evidence of strongly interacting quantum states with high densities and possible new quantum phases.

Conclusion: This discovery opens new avenues for exploring strongly dipolar quantum matter in ultracold molecules and paves the way for realizing self-organized crystal and spin liquid phases in optical lattices.

Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform
for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional
shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the
creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein
condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases
in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has
so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound
droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar
sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions
with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which
interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude,
we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing
a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating
two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times
higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and
suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work
establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly
dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized
crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.

expansion from optical lattices, encode essential information about strongly
correlated lattice systems, including phase coherence and non-local
correlations. While the interference of lattice bosons has been extensively
investigated, quantitative studies of the lattice fermion interference remain
challenging. Here, we report the observation and quantitative characterization
of interference patterns in low-temperature, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard
gases. We develop a novel method to extract first-order correlations from
interference patterns, which directly reflect the short-range phase coherence
of lattice fermions. Mapping the nearest-neighbor correlations as a function of
lattice filling and interaction strength, we observe a crossover from a metal
to a Mott insulator. Moreover, at half filling, the measured correlations agree
well with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and remain finite in the regime of
strong repulsion, revealing virtual tunneling processes driven by quantum
fluctuations.

TL;DR: 研究了超导体的费米式极化光电子模式形成，在周期性驱动的、扇形形状的自旋轨道耦合玻色爱因斯坦凝聚态中以条纹相位制备。通过调制原子相互作用，分别采用同相和反相协议，观察到具有不同旋转对称性的集体激发模式（L重）。关键发现：在临界调制频率下，反相调制破坏了L=6模式，而同相调制不仅保持了高对称性，还能激发更高阶的模式（L≥6）。与常规二元玻色爱因斯坦凝聚态不同，这些费米式极化光电子模式的形成不需要初始噪声，是由于自旋轨道效应导致的对称性破坏，所有模式都表现出固有晶格特性和超流特性。此外，通过调制频率可调节模式对称性、环向节点和模式半径，提供了一种新的方法来控制量子流体动力学。这项研究为探索自旋轨道系统中具有条纹相位的超流性和非线性激发提供了平台。

Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven,
pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared
with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using $in$-$phase$ and
$out$-$of$-$phase$ protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with
distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation
frequency, $out$-$of$-$phase$ modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern,
whereas $in$-$phase$ modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also
excites higher-order modes (L $\ge $ 6). Unlike conventional binary BECs,
Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry
breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore,
we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius
by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating
quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring
supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.

Abstract: Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents
other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard
methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that
realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without
fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq2$ golden anyon chains
together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We
use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to
calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its
irrationality. As a byproduct of our analysis, we provide an extensive list of
rational CFTs with $1<c<2.1$.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity and Canonical Quantum Gravity by analyzing their formalisms and the role of observables and renormalization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge two quantum gravity approaches, highlighting the connection between their formalisms and the importance of observables and renormalization.

Method: The paper uses a Hamiltonian formulation within Canonical Quantum Gravity to construct generating functionals of correlation functions, employing Background-independent, non-perturbative renormalization methods such as the Functional Renormalization Group to link Covariant and Canonical approaches.

Result: A systematic connection is established between the quantization procedures and renormalization group methods, bridging the Covariant and Canonical approaches and providing a foundation for a predictive quantum gravity theory.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that this synthesis offers a promising avenue for a consistent quantum theory of gravity based on physically meaningful, gauge-invariant observables.

Abstract: In the context of gravity the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms have been
developed largely independently, emphasizing renormalization and quantization,
respectively. The formalisms use a different methodology to distinguish between
gauge and physical degrees of freedom. In this review we analyze the connection
between the Asymptotically Safe and Canonical Quantum Gravity approaches. Based
on the Hamiltonian formulation, the Canonical Quantum Gravity approach
inherently provides a natural framework for defining observables. This serves
as the foundation for constructing the generating functional of the $n$-point
correlation functions of physical degrees of freedom. By means of
background-independent, non-perturbative renormalization methods
well-established in the Lagrangian framework and typically employed in
Asymptotic Safety, the resulting generating functional can be handled. In
particular, we employ the Functional Renormalization Group to regularize the
path integral and to compute the flow connecting the bare theory in the
ultraviolet with the effective infrared theory. An important advantage of this
approach is that it establishes an explicit, systematic relation between the
quantization procedure and the systematics of quantum field theory-based
renormalization group methods. More importantly, this synthesis not only
bridges canonical and covariant approaches but also paves the way for a
consistent and predictive quantum theory of gravity grounded in physically
meaningful, gauge-invariant observables.

recently conjectured in Mellin space and also test our result in a few
nontrivial theories.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores the quantization of multiplicative Higgs bundles using five-dimensional N=1 gauge theories, connecting related geometric and algebraic structures like q-operators and spin chains, and relates them to cluster algebras via the BPS quiver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper combines elements from high-energy physics (gauge theories) and algebraic structures (spin chains, cluster algebras) to explore quantization and duality, aiming to bridge physics and mathematics.

Method: Uses 5d gauge theory in Ω-background to construct q-operators and q-difference equations, then relates them to spin chains and cluster algebras using Fourier transforms and BPS quiver analysis.

Result: Establishes a direct link between the mathematical structures (q-operators, spin chains, cluster algebras) and the physical constructions, providing a new framework for understanding these dualities.

Conclusion: This work offers significant progress in understanding the deep connections between high-energy physics and algebraic geometry, with potential implications for both fields.

Abstract: We study the quantization of the moduli space of multiplicative Higgs bundles
through the lens of five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge
theories in $\Omega$-background. We extend the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge
theoretical construction of key geometric and representation-theoretic
structures, established in earlier works, to the five-dimensional uplift. We
construct and analyze the $Q$-operators and $q$-opers associated with the
canonical codimension-two defect: the $Q$-operators are defined via the
insertion of the defect, while the $q$-opers arise as the $q$-difference chiral
ring equations in its presence. The $q$-oper difference equations are further
identified with the Baxter TQ equations for XXZ spin chains constructed from
tensor products of bi-infinite evaluation modules over quantum affine algebras
of type ${\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$. We define a $q$-difference module structure on
the space of monodromy codimension-two defect partition functions and show that
the eigenstates of the $Q$-operators, constructed from monodromy defects,
simultaneously diagonalize the quantum Hamiltonians of the XXZ spin chain. A
Fourier transformation exchanges the $Q$-operators associated with two XXZ spin
chains bispectral dual to each other. Finally, we relate these constructions to
the quantum cluster algebra arising from the BPS quiver of the 5d theory, and
re-express the R-matrices in terms of the cluster variables.

### [128] [BCFW like recursion for Deformed Associahedron](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14583)
*Sujoy Mahato,Sourav Roychowdhury*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses using recursion relations derived from positive geometries to study scattering amplitudes in theories with multiple scalar particles. It builds on previous work about using ABHY associahedrons and D-type cluster polytopes to describe tree-level and one-loop amplitudes. The authors also explore applying these techniques to Effective Field Theory amplitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to expand the application of BCFW-like recursion relations to more complex theories, which could provide a deeper understanding of Yang-Mills interactions and amplituhedron-like structures. Additionally, it seeks to bridge methods from positive geometry with effective field theory to uncover new insights into scattering amplitudes.

Method: The authors use techniques from positive geometry within the kinematic space formalism. They consider deformed versions of ABHY associahedrons and D-type cluster polytopes to capture scattering amplitudes at tree level and one-loop for scalar theories interacting via cubic couplings. They also propose a method to derive projective triangulations of these geometries to facilitate the recursion relations. Finally, they suggest integrating their findings into effective field theory to derive amplitudes.

Result: The paper presents a framework for utilizing recursion relations and positive geometries to compute tree-level and one-loop scattering amplitudes in scalar theories with cubic interactions, including applications to effective field theory amplitudes. Key contributions are the use of deformed polytopes and triangulations to adapt recursion relations to new geometries. This approach unifies and extends various methods in the study of scattering amplitudes, providing a geometric and combinatorial foundation for recursion-based computations.

Conclusion: The work concludes by highlighting potential future applications of the developed methods in broader contexts, including N=4 SYM, other gauge theories, and the extension to loop-level recursion relations. The authors emphasize the importance of cross-connecting positive geometry with effective field theory techniques to explore new aspects of quantum field theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the applicability of the BCFW-like recursion
relations \cite{He:2018svj,Yang:2019esm} to a wider class of positive
geometries. Previously it was found in \cite{Jagadale:2022rbl}, the tree level
scattering amplitude of a theory with more than one type of scalar particles
interacting via cubic couplings of different strength can be captured by a
deformed realization of the ABHY-associahedorn in the kinematic space. In the
literature, we explore the adaptation of the recursion relations for the case
of deformed associahedron. The formalism is further generalized to the deformed
realization of the D-type cluster polytopes which captures the one-loop
amplitudes in this class of cubic theories. These recursion terms correspond to
projective triangulation of the associahedron (or D-type cluster polytopes).
Towards the end, we briefly mention the idea of recovering EFT amplitudes from
the cubic theory in terms of recursion relations.

### [129] [One-point functions in AdS/dCFT: MPS and twisted Yangian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15462)
*Xin Qian*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the calculation of scalar one-point functions in the SO(6) sector of the D5-D3 probe-brane setup. It uses integrable systems techniques like Bethe ansatz, Matrix Product States, and Yangian algebras. The authors relate these to overlaps between states and demonstrate a method for finding these overlaps using branching rules. The findings may apply beyond probe-branes to non-equilibrium systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the desire to compute one-point functions in a specific D-brane system, relying on integrability and related algebraic structures.

Method: The method involves coordinate and algebraic Bethe ansatz, Matrix Product States, and extended twisted Yangian algebras, focusing on overlaps between states and using branching rules.

Result: The result introduces a method to calculate overlaps using these tools, particularly for scalar one-point functions, suggesting applications in non-equilibrium systems.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their method effectively calculates the required overlaps and opens up potential uses in other contexts like non-equilibrium systems.

Abstract: I focus on the scalar one-point functions in SO(6) sector of D5-D3
probe-brane set-up. Start with a general introduction of integrability, I
explore both coordinate Bethe ansatz and algebraic Bethe ansatz, with possible
generalization. I then shortly review how to use the Bethe ansatz in $N = 4$
super Yang-Mills theory, and then apply such procedure to the D5-D3 system. The
dual field theory of such system corresponds to a defected version of $N = 4$
super Yang-Mills theory, where the one-point functions of certain scalars are
non-zero. The calculation of one-point functions is mapped to the overlap
between matrix product states and Bethe states. The matrix product states are
found to be solutions of the twisted Boundary Yang-Baxter equation, and
equivalently the representations of extended twisted Yangian. By dressing
procedure or coproduct property, we can connect the scalar matrix product state
and higher dimension matrix product states. We have used the branching rules to
find the connection with some detailed parameters needed to be fixed. Such
method can not only be used for calculations of one-point functions in
probe-branes system, but also shed some light on non-equilibrium system.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel AQFT formulation of a non-Abelian gauge theory, specifically 1+1D massless Schwinger model, constructing local observable algebras without localizing charged fields, showing confinement through absence of DHR sectors, and linking confinement to quantum information issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a rigorous AQFT framework for gauge theories, addressing issues like confinement and DHR sectors which have been challenging in traditional treatments.

Method: The authors construct local observable algebras using gauge-invariant composite operators and show confinement by the absence of DHR superselection sectors. They also introduce nonlocal observables and demonstrate violations of Haag duality.

Result: A rigorous AQFT framework is provided, solving confinement and DHR issues, understanding nonlocal observables, and linking confinement with quantum information concepts.

Conclusion: This approach offers a solid foundation for non-Abelian gauge theories like QCD.

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel formulation of the massless Schwinger
model-quantum electrodynamics in $1+1$ dimensions-within the framework of
Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT), emphasizing features that transcend the
traditional bosonized treatments. Instead of mapping the model to a free
massive scalar field, we construct a net of local observable algebras directly
from the gauge-theoretic content, subject to the local ${U(1)}$ gauge symmetry
and Gauss's law constraint. We show that local algebras can be consistently
defined in terms of gauge-invariant composite operators, while charged fields
necessarily fail to be localizable in bounded regions, manifesting confinement
as the absence of DHR superselection sectors. Furthermore, we rigorously
characterize nonlocal observables such as Wilson line operators within an
extended net, and demonstrate the violation of Haag duality as a signature of
the nontrivial topological and gauge structure of the theory. We additionally
propose a conjecture linking the violation of Haag duality in confining gauge
theories to a breakdown in entanglement wedge reconstruction, suggesting that
confinement obstructs the local recovery of quantum information. Our approach
provides a complete AQFT-based treatment of confinement, Gauss law, and
nonlocal gauge-invariant operators in a solvable gauge theory, laying the
groundwork for future extensions to non-Abelian models like QCD.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the relationship between the electromagnetic helicity flux density and magnetic helicity using Chern-Simons terms and Hopf solitons. It derives formulas for the helicity flux density for a point charge in acceleration, extends the Liénard-Wiechert distribution, and applies these results to various models and potential applications in pulsars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be delving into specific aspects of electromagnetic and magnetic helicity, which are concepts in electromagnetism and knot theory. The use of Chern-Simons terms and Hopf solitons suggests a connection to topological aspects of field configurations. The derivation of specific expressions for helicity flux density for accelerating charges implies applications in understanding radiation fields and their associated helicity, which is relevant in areas like astrophysics and plasma physics, particularly in phenomena such as pulsars.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis and derivation of mathematical expressions. It starts by establishing the relationship between the electromagnetic helicity flux density and magnetic helicity through topological Chern-Simons terms. The authors then introduce Hopf solitons to distinguish between these two helicity measures. Subsequent sections involve solving Maxwell's equations for specific scenarios, such as an accelerated charge, and deriving the associated multipole expansion. Applications to various models like circular motion, helical motion, and bremsstrahlung radiation are considered, and potential applications to pulsar systems are discussed.

Result: The key findings include the derivation of an expression linking EM and magnetic helicity via Chern-Simons terms, the distinction between helicity flux density and magnetic helicity based on Hopf solitons, the generalized Larmor formula for radiation fields with helicity flux density, and applications to helical and circular motion models. The paper also extends the Liénard-Wiechert angular distribution and explores bremsstrahlung radiation. Notably, the authors suggest potential applications of their findings to the study of helicity in pulsars, indicating implications in astrophysical phenomena.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the helicity flux density and its relationship to magnetic helicity, utilizing Chern-Simons terms and Hopf solitons. The derived formulas are applied to various physical models, showcasing the versatility of the theory. Furthermore, the paper draws promising conclusions about the applicability of these findings to the study of helicity in pulsars, suggesting potential advancements in understanding astrophysical processes involving such systems.

Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) helicity flux density and the magnetic helicity are
related by topological Chern-Simons terms. We show that the helicity flux
density is distinguished from magnetic helicity by analysing Hopf solitons. We
find the helicity flux density for a point charge moving with an acceleration,
extending the Li\'enard-Wiechert angular distribution of radiant power. We also
derive the multipole expansion of the helicity flux density, generalizing the
Larmor's formula for the radiant power. These formulae have been applied to
discuss the helicity flux density in several toy models such as circular and
helical motion as well as soft bremsstrahlung. We also comment on the potential
applications of the EM helicity flux density to pulsar systems.

Abstract: We construct superinvariants in M-theory via local supersymmetry, which
include $(DF)^4$ terms and fermionic bilinear terms with mass dimension eight.
The bases of the $(DF)^4$ and the fermionic bilinear terms are classified and
the variations under the local supersymmetry are evaluated by using the
Mathematica codes. By imposing the local supersymmetry, we find that 24

Abstract: It is known that hyperbolic monopoles, with a particular value of the
curvature, can be obtained from ADHM instanton data that satisfies additional
constraints. Here this data is reformulated in terms of a triplet of real
matrices that satisfy a set of quartic equations, with solutions associated
with representations of su(2). Many of the known examples of hyperbolic
monopoles can easily be recovered in this formulation by evaluating Nahm data
for Euclidean monopoles at the centre of its domain. Toda reductions of Nahm's
equation correspond to cyclic Euclidean monopoles, and this is adapted to the
hyperbolic setting to obtain solutions, even when the corresponding Nahm data
is not tractable. A new family of charge 4 hyperbolic monopoles with square
symmetry is presented as an example.

Abstract: The study of critical phenomena in one-dimensional field theories with

proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and demonstrate that the
natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, and previously
unidentified universality classes is evident.

Abstract: We analyze the momentum-space representations of the Lorentzian correlators
of scalar primary operators in an arbitrary 2D CFT. These correlators
characterize the effective dynamics of open quantum systems. We derive the
results from the Euclidean correlators through a systematic continuation to
Lorentzian signature. Abstractly, it is known that the convergence of the OPE
guarantees that the analytic continuation can be carried out also in the case
of the four-point function. Here we explicitly perform such analytic
continuation, showing that the general structure of the four-point correlator
is preserved in Lorentzian signature.

### [137] [Non-perturbative aspects of entanglement structures in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15220)
*Wen-Xin Lai,Huajia Wang,Yongjiang Xu*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effect of $Tar{T}$ deformation on entanglement entropy in 2D CFTs, identifying two saddle-point contributions that suggest the dynamical length scale as the effective cut-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how non-local features emerge in deformed theories and identifying the mechanism by which an effective length scale arises to regulate entanglement entropy.

Method: Used the replica trick and semi-classical approximation to analyze the deformed replica partition function, calculating kernel functions and performing saddle-point analysis.

Result: Two saddle-point contributions identified, with non-perturbative effects pointing towards new mechanisms for the effective cut-off.

Conclusion: Demonstrates how $Tar{T}$ deformation affects entanglement entropy and introduces novel saddle-points that suggest the emergence of an effective cut-off mechanism.

Abstract: Turning on the $T\bar{T}$-deformation in a two-dimensional CFT provides a
unique window to study explicitly how non-local features arise in the UV as a
result of the deformation. A sharp signature is the dynamical emergence of an
effective length-scale $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$ that separates the local and
non-local regimes of the deformed theory, effectively serving as a UV cut-off
for computing observables in the local regime. In this paper, we study this
phenomenon through the entanglement structures of the deformed theory. We focus
on computing the Renyi entropies of single-interval sub-regions in the deformed
vacuum states. We pay particular attention to the interplay between the bare
entanglement cut-off inherited from the CFT computation and the effects from
the $T\bar{T}$ deformations. Applying the general replica trick to the string
theory formulation of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs, we derive an explicit
representation of the deformed replica partition function as a weighted
integral of the CFT results evaluated at a dynamical cut-off, which is
integrated over. We computed in detail the kernel functions of the integral
representation, and performed the saddle-point analysis in the semi-classical
limit of small $\mu$. We found that in addition to the perturbative
saddle-point which identifies the dynamical cut-off with the bare entanglement
cut-off, there exists another non-perturbative saddle-point that identifies the
dynamical cut-off with the $T\bar{T}$ length-scale $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$, but
whose contribution is exponentially small. We discuss how these
non-perturbative effects can shed lights on the mechanism through which the
$T\bar{T}$ length-scale may eventually replace the bare counter-part and become
the effective entanglement cut-off.

*Tomohito Shiga,Kenta Suzuki*

TL;DR: This paper explores classifying conformal fluid boundary conditions using the AdS/BCFT correspondence, analyzing different boundary conditions for a brane and their implications for the hydrodynamic behavior of boundary field theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding boundary conditions in holographic correspondence helps classify conformal fluids, which is relevant for topics like hydrodynamics and BCFTs.

Method: Analyzing end-of-world brane metrics under Neumann, Dirichlet, and Conformal boundary conditions to derive fluid BC.

Result: Different brane conditions lead to specific fluid boundary conditions via hydrodynamic limits.

Conclusion: The study provides a structured approach to classifying conformal fluid BC via the AdS/BCFT duality.

Abstract: In this paper, we initiate our program to classify conformal fluid boundary
conditions, by utilizing the fluid/gravity correspondence in the AdS/BCFT
correspondence. The AdS/BCFT correspondence is a conjectured duality between a
quantum gravity in asymptotically AdS spacetime with an end-of-the world brane
and a boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). We show that a choice of boundary
condition for the metric on the end-of-the world brane naturally leads to
specific boundary conditions for velocity field and temperature field of BCFT
in the hydrodynamic limit. We analyze the Neumann, Dirichlet and Conformal
boundary conditions for the metric on the end-of-the world brane, and discuss
their implications for conformal fluid boundary conditions.

Conclusion: 这个研究通过结合信息论和几何视角，提供了新的工具来研究量子系统中的纠缠和可恢复性，可能为量子反构建提供新的见解。

Abstract: The Markov gap, defined as the difference between reflected entropy and
mutual information, serves as a diagnostic for quantum recoverability and
multipartite entanglement. In holographic settings, it admits a geometric
interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and
RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a
generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected
multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric
obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this
quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and
examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps.
We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to
vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these
quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite
structure in holographic quantum systems.

Conclusion: 发现’t Hooft异常可有效控制边界面的电荷输运行为，为材料科学和量子计算中的新效应提供理论依据。

Abstract: Symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries by extended dynamical defects
entails the existence of continuous families of defects, which form conformal
manifolds in a critical setup. In the presence of bulk 't Hooft anomalies,
defects are in fact required to break the symmetry: defect conformal manifolds
are anomaly-enforced. We show that, by coupling the system to a modulated
deformation parameter, the geometric structure of the conformal manifold is
sensible to the 't Hooft anomaly. This leads to measurable effects in the
presence of a boundary/defect: in (1+1)d the anomaly predicts a quantized
boundary charge pumping, while in higher dimensions it gives rise to
non-dissipative boundary Hall currents.

Result: 标量电荷相互作用仅在两侧时显著变化，无穷大耦合下满足 MIT 类边界条件

Conclusion: 研究发现平面势垒显著影响二维系统的行为，未来可探索其他势垒结构

Abstract: In this paper we propose a coupling between the complex scalar field and an
external Dirac delta-like planar potential. The coupling is achieved through
the Klein-Gordon current normal to the plane where the potential is
concentrated. The results are obtained exactly and exhibit many peculiarities.
We show that a complex scalar charge does not interact with the potential, but
the potential modifies the interaction between two scalar charges if they are
placed on opposite sides of the planar potential. When the coupling constant
between the potential and the field goes to infinity, the classical field
solutions satisfy a kind of MIT boundary conditions along the plane where the
potential is concentrated.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了精确的mass谱分析，验证了延续到参数复平面的可能性。该分析为深入探索meson结构提供了方法论基础。

Abstract: We study the two-particle approximation of the Ising Field Theory (IFT),
formulated in terms of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. Derived by Fonseca and
Zamolodchikov as a systematic realization of the McCoy-Wu approach, this
equation captures confinement by modeling ``mesons'' as bound states of two
Majorana fermions (``quarks''), in a way analogous to the integral equation in
the 't Hooft model. Despite its approximate nature, the BS equation provides
remarkably accurate predictions for the mass spectrum of stable mesons across a
wide range of parameters. Motivated by the striking structural similarity
between the BS equation in IFT and the 't Hooft equation in two-dimensional
QCD, we develop a new non-perturbative analytical framework inspired by the
method of Fateev, Lukyanov, and Zamolodchikov (FLZ). Within this approach, we
compute spectral sums and systematically derive the large-$n$ WKB expansion for
the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which governs the spectrum of an infinite tower of
mesons. We further examine how our analytical results capture the known
behavior of the spectrum in well-studied asymptotic regimes, such as the $E_8$
limit and the free-fermion point, where exact solutions are available for
comparison. Finally, we discuss how the obtained spectral data admit a natural
analytic continuation to complex values of the parameters -- an extension that
was one of the primary motivations for this work.

TL;DR: The paper examines the validity of improved one-loop beta functions in gravity theories by analyzing gauge dependence of curvature-squared operators, and finds them to be gauge-dependent, impacting theory predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to verify whether improved beta functions better describe high-energy gravity theories, particularly focusing on curvature-squared terms and their gauge dependence.

Method: The study uses the background field method to compute gauge dependence in quadratic and conformal gravity theories at one-loop level.

Result: The results show that the one-loop momentum running is gauge-dependent, which affects the theory's physical predictivity.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that improved beta functions, while useful, cannot fully eliminate gauge dependence, posing a challenge to the theories' predictability.

Abstract: Recent works have argued that improved one-loop beta-functions capturing the
physical momentum dependence of one-loop corrected higher-derivative gravity
theories are the most suitable to describe their high-energy behaviour. This
work critically tests the validity of this claim. We compute the explicit gauge
dependence of the one-loop momentum running of curvature-squared operators in
quadratic gravity and conformal gravity using the background field method. We
find them to be gauge dependent, and we discuss the implications of this result
for the theory and its physical predictivity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Latent Ewald Summation (LES)的方法，用于改进现有的机器学习能隙势（MLIP），特别是在处理长距离电statics方面。通过与多个方法如MACE、NequIP等结合使用，实验结果表明LES显著提高了预测的准确性。此外， LES被扩展到大规模的SPICE数据集，并被用来训练一个全电势模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在分子动力学领域中的应用日益广泛，特别是在模拟大规模系统时，长距离的电statics处理尤为关键。现有方法要么依赖于经验公式，要么在训练数据中难以直接处理这些问题。因此，寻找一种高效且无需直接训练电statics的方法变得尤为重要。

Method: 作者开发了Latent Ewald Summation (LES)方法，该方法通过从能量和力的训练数据中学习，来推断电statics，包括电极化和Born效应。此外，作者还将其与多个机器学习方法（如MACE、NequIP）结合，并扩展了该方法到大规模数据集，以实现全电势模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用LES增强的模型在预测电statics方面表现优异，尤其是在长距离相互作用中。特别地，通过训练MACELES-OFF，模型显著提高了对分子极性和Born效应的预测能力，并且对液态 bulk的表现更加精准。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何通过机器学习改进分子势，特别是在处理长距离电statics方面。通过将LES与现有方法结合，并扩展到大规模数据集，作者实现了更准确且高效的方法，为分子动力学中的建模和计算提供了新工具。这种方法展示了将机器学习应用于分子相互作用的潜力。

Abstract: Most current machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) rely on
short-range approximations, without explicit treatment of long-range
electrostatics. To address this, we recently developed the Latent Ewald
Summation (LES) method, which infers electrostatic interactions, polarization,
and Born effective charges (BECs), just by learning from energy and force
training data. Here, we present LES as a standalone library, compatible with
any short-range MLIP, and demonstrate its integration with methods such as
MACE, NequIP, CACE, and CHGNet. We benchmark LES-enhanced models on distinct
systems, including bulk water, polar dipeptides, and gold dimer adsorption on
defective substrates, and show that LES not only captures correct
electrostatics but also improves accuracy. Additionally, we scale LES to large
and chemically diverse data by training MACELES-OFF on the SPICE set containing
molecules and clusters, making a universal MLIP with electrostatics for organic
systems including biomolecules. MACELES-OFF is more accurate than its
short-range counterpart (MACE-OFF) trained on the same dataset, predicts
dipoles and BECs reliably, and has better descriptions of bulk liquids. By
enabling efficient long-range electrostatics without directly training on
electrical properties, LES paves the way for electrostatic foundation MLIPs.

Conclusion: 此方法为Collagen的重构提供了一种新的策略，提示了在生物材料中的潜在应用。

Abstract: The hierarchical triple-helix structure of collagen type I, Col I, is
essential for extracellular matrix support and integrity. However, current
reconstruction strategies face challenges such as chain mismatch, preventing
proper fibril formation. Here, we report a supramolecular co-assembly strategy
using a de novo-designed alpha-helical peptide amphiphile (APA) of just seven
amino acids. The APA features a hydrophobic palmitic acid tail, which
stabilizes the helical structure and promotes co-assembly upon interaction with
complementary molecular structures. This minimal design enables selective
recognition of fragmented collagen (FC), restoring triple-helix conformation
and guiding fibre formation. We applied this mechanism to engineer FC-rich
nanofat (NF) into a mechanically reinforced biomaterial. Integration of APA-NF
with coaxial 3D printing enabled spatial control of structure and function. In
a porcine model, this platform enhanced in situ vascularized adipose tissue
regeneration. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical reconstruction of
collagen via peptide-guided supramolecular assembly offers a promising strategy
for soft tissue repair.

Conclusion: 结论认为电离的主要途径是通过CH2I的旋转周期和分裂成三个离子体，并提出了动态模型来解释电荷释放机制。

Abstract: We present an efficient theoretical model to simulate observables in the
time-resolved coincident three-ion Coulomb explosion experiment of
diiodomethane. The model employs two degrees of freedom to characterize the C-I
bond breaking and the $\text{CH}_2\text{I}$ rotation during photodissociation,
and three degrees of freedom to characterize the coincident
$\text{CH}_2^{+}+\text{I}^{2+}+\text{I}^{2+}$ fragmentation during the
following Coulomb explosion. By solving the equation of motion, the
photodissociation paths are uncovered on two-dimensional potential energy
surfaces of the A-band excited states of the neutral molecule and the
asymptotic momenta of the three ionic fragments are obtained on the
three-dimensional ground-state potential energy surface of the five-fold
charged cation. The photodissociation paths are consistent with previous ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations and indicate the $\text{CH}_2\text{I}$
rotational period to be around 340 fs. The theoretical time-dependent kinetic
energy release and the correlation between the kinetic energy release and the
angle between the two $\text{I}^{2+}$ momenta show good agreement with the
experimental signals in parts, which reflects and confirms the static
$\text{CH}_2\text{I}_2$ state and the $\text{CH}_2\text{I}+\text{I}$
dissociation channels.

Abstract: Iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) play a wide variety of roles in biochemical
processes that are common to all domains of life on earth. The hyperfine
structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally
and theoretically by means of hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal
catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical
prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly
correlated systems, or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic
structure methods. This work shows how the addition of electron-transfer
interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to the
quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic
ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms our
extended approach has the potential to be used in calculations aimed at

Result: 模型解释了热增强放疗下的 DNA 灵敏度提高，除了修复抑制外，还有温度依赖性物理因素。

Conclusion: 热射线增强治疗可能需要更精确地调整温度等物理参数来优化治疗效果。

Abstract: Objective: Hyperthermia (HT), characterized by elevated tissue temperatures
above physiological levels, is a well-established radiosensitizer. When
combined with radiotherapy (RT), forming thermoradiotherapy (TRT), a
synergistic effect is observed across in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies.
The greatest radiosensitization occurs when HT and RT are applied
simultaneously. This work aims to explore physical mechanisms -- beyond DNA
repair inhibition -- that contribute to this synergy.
  Approach: We developed a biophysical model for the thermal enhancement ratio
(TER), incorporating temperature-dependent variations in the number of
vulnerable DNA sites, the DNA-ion/particle interaction cross-section, and other
physicochemical parameters. These include ion production rate, diffusion
processes, and medium density. The model includes misrepair effects
phenomenologically, which make it consistent with other studies.
  Main results: The model reproduces TER values observed under simultaneous HT
and RT in isolated plasmids with variable temperature. Our results indicate
that, in addition to misrepair, other physical factors contribute to
radiosensitization under concurrent treatment. Among these, the
temperature-dependent amplification of DNA-ion/particle interaction
cross-section -- driven by enhanced DNA thermal fluctuations structure --
emerges as the second most influential factor.
  Significance: These findings suggest that thermal radiosensitization arises
not only from impaired repair, but also from increased physical vulnerability
of the DNA. The model provides mechanistic insight for optimizing TRT
parameters.

*Henri Gouin*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a simplified model showing plant stems climb on vertical circular helices, influenced by stake diameter and stem fineness. They used variational principles, neglecting gravity and turgor for thin stems, focusing on elasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding plant growth mechanics and form is crucial for biology, botany, and agriculture. The paper tackles a complex problem with elegant simplifications, seeking to explain plant climbing mechanics.

Method: The authors used a variational principle approach, considering minimal energy for a plant stem under the influence of gravity, turgor pressure, and elasticity. They analyzed thin stems, neglecting gravity and turgor, focusing on energy from elasticity.

Result: The analysis revealed that plant stems ascend primarily on helical stands with vertical orientation, emphasizing the role of stake diameter and stem thickness. The static equilibrium explains stable climbing helices and unstable spirals when these factors are imbalanced.

Conclusion: Studying plant stem mechanics through static equilibrium can explain their climbing behavior. The model provides a foundation, incorporating growth over time and mechanical forces for dynamic analysis in future studies. For the vertical climb, the model successfully predicts helical paths influenced by critical factors like diameter and thickness.

Abstract: Since Charles Darwin's time, the study of climbing plants on a cylindrical
stake has been the subject of numerous articles in plant biology. One of the
main ideas for studying the coiling of an elastic plant stem is to consider the
growth of the plant stem in terms of evolution over time. However, as this
development takes place over a long time scale, the static study alone has not
been studied independently. Our static approach requires us to take into
account elasticity, turgor pressure and gravity forces in a first analysis. The
aim of this article is to present a simplified model demonstrating why plant
stems climb mainly on their circular helix-shaped stakes, with the diameter of
the stake playing an important role in plant stem ascent, as does the fineness
of the stem. To perform this calculation, for a given mass density, we consider
the variational principle of minimum energy. For thin plant stems, we can see,
in first approximation, that the effect of gravity and turgor pressure can be
neglected with respect to the energy of elasticity, and that the bulk of the
calculation concerns elasticity terms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a ROHF model for composite superconductors that simplifies modeling by reducing computational effort through reduced-order modeling of flux and current relationships, with the option to include eddy currents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting magnets require accurate but computationally efficient models; this paper addresses the challenge of modeling composite superconductors by creating a reduced-order flux model that allows for homogenization.

Method: The paper presents the Reduced Order Hysteretic Flux (ROHF) model, which is parametrized using reference simulations to compute macroscopic quantities like voltage and power loss without detailed electromagnetic solutions. This model supports homogenization by enabling the reduction of strand structures and computational effort, offering both rate-independent and rate-dependent variants.

Result: The modeling workflow, including parameter identification, field coupling, and post-processing, is validated using a twisted multifilamentary strand, demonstrating the model's applicability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The ROHF model provides an efficient approach to modeling composite superconductors, applicable for large-scale magnets, by simplifying flux and current relationships, thus enabling faster and more feasible simulations without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Reduced Order Hysteretic Flux (ROHF) model to
describe the relationship between time-varying transport current and internal
magnetic flux for composite superconductors. The ROHF model is parametrized
using reference simulations of the conductor response, after which it enables
the computation of macroscopic quantities such as voltage and power loss
without requiring detailed electromagnetic field solutions. It is therefore
suitable for the homogenization of transport current effects in large-scale
superconducting magnets, avoiding a fine discretization of the composite strand
small scale structures, allowing to drastically reduce the computational
effort. The approximation can be implemented either (i) as a rate-independent
model, neglecting eddy current effects in the normal conducting matrix, or (ii)
as a rate-dependent model, including those eddy current effects. In this paper,
the complete modeling workflow, including parameter identification, coupling
with the other fields (temperature and magnetic field), and post-processing of
the results, is described and verified using a twisted multifilamentary strand
as an example.

The findings contribute to a greater understanding of the dynamic properties of these molecular systems and open new avenues for their application in fields such as biophysics and nanotechnology.

Abstract: During our previous modeling using all-atom molecular dynamics, we have
identified several foldamers whose nanoscale behavior resembles that of classic
bistable machines, namely the Euler archs and Duffing oscillators. However,
time limitations of the all-atom molecular dynamics prevent us from performing
a full-scale investigation of long-time behavior and prompt us to develop a
coarse-grained model. In this work, we summarize our recent research on
developing such models using the most widely available method called Martini.

### [152] [Supercurrent tuning of the Josephson coupling energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14357)
*Maxwell Wisne,Venkat Chandrasekhar*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper describes a new method to tune Josephson coupling without a flux loop, using supercurrent biasing, which reduces noise sensitivity in qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust qubit designs in quantum computing, especially against environmental noise like flux, leads the authors to explore alternatives to traditional tuning methods.

Method: Use supercurrent from separate superconducting leads to bias a junction, allowing the tuning of Josephson coupling energy without a flux loop.

Result: The proposed method successfully demonstrates reduced susceptibility to flux noise, paving the way for more reliable qubit designs.

Conclusion: This breakthrough offers a promising approach to creating tunable qubits with lower noise sensitivity, enhancing their potential in quantum computing applications.

Abstract: The ability to non-dissipatively tune the Josephson coupling energy of
Josephson junctions is a useful tool in frequency-tunable qubits. This is
typically done by threading magnetic flux through two junctions connected in a
loop, a geometry that exposes the qubit to magnetic environmental noise. In
this paper, we show that by biasing a junction with supercurrent from a
separate pair of superconducting leads coupled to the device, the Josephson
energy can be tuned without the need for a flux loop. Our multiterminal device
may enable the realization of a frequency-tunable qubit with greatly reduced
susceptibility to flux noise.

Result: 发现了光发射光的极性由传播方向和偏置极性决定，机制依赖于螺旋性和偏置电压分布，而无需磁矩和自旋轨道效应。

Conclusion: 可以利用此机制设计控制极性和方向的显微光子源。

Abstract: In the present work we theoretically analyze electroluminescence occurring in
a biased single-molecule junction with a chiral bridge imitated by a helical
chain. We show that optical transitions between electron states of the chiral
linker may result in the emission of circular polarized light whose handedness
depends on both direction of propagation and the polarity of the bias voltage
provided that the coupling between the bridge sites is sufficiently strong. The
mechanism controlling this specific light emission does not depend on the
magnetic moments and spin-orbit interactions. It rather relies on the chiral
properties of the bridge molecule and on the distribution of the bias voltage
between the electrodes in the junction.

*Matthew Copus,Ezio Iacocca*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study compares pseudospectral and conventional micromagnetic models for annihilation of magnetic skyrmions, finding that the choice of model and spatial discretization significantly influence dynamics and required fields, with pseudospectral models providing consistent results across scales and capturing complex behaviors, having implications for modeling other textures like hopfions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is to address the limitations of numerical modeling in magnetic soliton studies, particularly at atomic scales, which is crucial for advancing the understanding of magnetic textures and their applications.

Method: The study employed pseudospectral modeling for skyrmion annihilation and compared it with conventional micromagnetic simulations. The method involved studying the exchange interaction, magnon dispersion, and uniaxial anisotropy.

Result: The results show that the pseudospectral model outperforms traditional models in accurately describing the annihilation process and capturing complex behaviors such as skyrmion breathing.

Conclusion: The findings will enhance modeling techniques for magnetic skyrmions and related 2D and 3D textures, positively impacting research in magnetism and materials science.

Abstract: The investigation of magnetic solitons often relies on numerical modeling to
determine key features such as stability, annihilation, nucleation, and motion.
However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these
predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical
model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions
using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of
conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the
models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the
magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial
anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model
and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and
the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides
a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours
such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct
implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other
two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional
textures such as hopfions.

Abstract: Engineering moir\'e superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures provides
fundamental control over emergent electronic, structural, and optical
properties allowing to affect topological and correlated phenomena. This
control is achieved through imposed periodic modulation of potentials and
targeted modifications of symmetries. For twisted bilayers of van der Waals
materials with rectangular lattices, such as PdSe2, this work shows that
one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e patterns emerge universally. This emergence is
driven by a series of critical twist angles (CAs). We investigate the geometric
origins of these unique 1D moir\'e patterns and develop a universal
mathematical framework to predict the CAs in twisted rectangular lattices.
Through a density functional theory (DFT) description of the electronic
properties of twisted bilayer PdSe2, we further reveal directionally localized
flat band structures, localized charge densities and strong spin-orbit coupling
along the dispersive direction which points to the emergence of an effectively
1D strongly spin-orbit coupled electronic systems. This establishes twisted
rectangular systems as a unique platform for engineering low-symmetry moir\'e
patterns, low-dimensional strongly correlated and topological physics, and
spatially selective quantum phases beyond the isotropic paradigms of hexagonal
moir\'e materials.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores the suppression of collective modes in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate, demonstrating that strong dipole-dipole interactions significantly reduce particle number fluctuations. While analytically challenging in three dimensions, two-dimensional simulations reveal significant suppression of these modes, suggesting potential experimental validation in the near future.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is about exploring the suppression of collective modes in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The authors propose that strong dipole-dipole interactions reduce particle number fluctuations, making the condensate more stable and coherent. They argue that this effect can be observed in experiments soon.

Method: The authors use both analytical mean-field approximation and numerical simulations, focusing on a two-dimensional system. They employ a system of coupled equations to model the condensate's dynamics, taking into account the spin-degenerate ground state and spin-orbit coupling effects.

Result: The simulations show that in two dimensions, strong dipole-dipole interactions lead to significant suppression of collective modes, reducing particle number fluctuations. This suggests that the condensate is more stable and coherent, making it promising for quantum information tasks.

Conclusion: In summary, the paper provides evidence that strong dipole-dipole interactions in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate can suppress collective modes and stabilize the condensate, offering a new avenue for studying quantum systems and potentially validating further through experiments.

Abstract: Superfluids under specific conditions can exhibit spontaneous breaking of
continuous translation symmetries and form exotic spatially ordered states of
matter known as supersolids. Despite its early theoretical prediction, it took
over half-a-centrury to experimentally demonstrate the supersolid phase in
ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, forming due to long-range
interatomic interactions. Here we propose as a promising new platform for
supersolidity exciton-polariton superfluids, confined in annular optically
induced traps. The supersolid phase emerges due to effective attractive
interactions, mediated by the normal excitonic component of the system.
Experimental demonstration of spontaneously formed spatially ordered phase is
in agreement with detailed mean-field theoretical analysis and numerical
simulation. The spontaneous character of the observed supersolid transition is
further evidenced by the formation of specific zero-energy Nambu-Goldstone
modes in the collective excitation spectrum.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR:  Papers demonstrate that light can induce a significant enhancement of the nonlinear Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas, with measurable increases in voltage and conductivity, suggesting potential applications in light-controlled electronic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving a substantial nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) signal is challenging, particularly for applications in nonlinear devices. This paper addresses this challenge by inducing a giant enhancement through light irradiation, potentially opening new possibilities for optoelectronic applications.

Method: The research employs transport measurements and uses first-principles calculations to analyze the optical-induced effects. They examine reflectivity, Hall voltage, and Hall conductivity under intense light illumination and through theoretical modeling of band structures.

Result: Under light, the second harmonic Hall voltage increases significantly and changes sign. The second-order transverse conductivity becomes extremely large, nearly five orders of magnitude higher, and the Berry curvature distribution on the Fermi surface explains the observed sign reversal of the NLHE.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that optical gating can effectively enhance and control the nonlinear Hall effect, offering a promising avenue for the development of light-activated nonlinear electronic devices.

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent phenomenon in
noncentrosymmetric systems, enables the generation of a transverse voltage
without an external magnetic field through a second-order electrical response.
However, achieving a sizable NLHE signal remains a critical challenge for its
application in frequency-doubling and rectifying devices. Here, we report a
light-induced giant enhancement of the NLHE in the two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (111) interface. Under light illumination, the
second harmonic Hall voltage (V2{\omega} y) increases substantially and
undergoes a sign reversal. Correspondingly,the second-order transverse
conductivity increases by nearly five orders of magnitude, reaching 2.4 um V-1
omega-1, while also reversing its sign. Scaling analysis indicates that skew
scattering is the dominant mechanism underlying the NLHE and is highly tunable
via optical gating. Photoexcitation pumps electrons from in-gap states into the
higher-lying Ta 5d conduction band, generating high-mobility photocarriers that
significantly increase the cubic transport scattering time, thereby driving a
dramatic enhancement of {\sigma}(2) yxx. First-principles calculations further
reveal that the Berry curvature distribution on the Fermi surface strongly
depends on band filling. As the Fermi level approaches a band crossing in the
Ta 5d subband near the M point, the Berry curvature triple undergoes a sign
change, accounting for the experimentally observed sign reversal of the
nonlinear Hall response. Our work offers a new strategy to optically boost and
tune the nonlinear Hall effect in oxide 2DEG systems, paving the way for
applications in light-controlled rectification and nonlinear electronic
devices.

Conclusion: 该方法为探索新型Dirac半金属和理解复杂量子材料的行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Dirac semimetals are classified into types I, II, and III based on the
topological charge of their Dirac points. If a three-dimensional (3D) system
can be sliced into a family of $k_z$-dependent normal and topological
insulators, type I Dirac points separate a 2D normal insulator from a 2D
first-order topological insulator, while type II (III) Dirac points separate a
2D normal (first-order) insulator from a 2D second-order topological insulator.
To investigate the effects arising from the interplay of distinct Dirac points,
one may wonder whether these Dirac points can coexist in single system. Here,
we propose a scheme to induce composite Dirac semimetals in a Floquet four-band
system with time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. A general description
is established to characterize Dirac semimetals in Floquet systems. The results
show that Dirac semimetals hosting coexisting type I, II, and III Dirac points
can be induced by delta-function or harmonic driving. Our results provide a
promising new avenue for exploring novel Dirac semimetals.

Conclusion: 该研究显示，在具有非厄密和非对称结构的人工材料中，借助 berry 曲率和电场偏转，可以诱导微粒产生横向力，为微粒操控新途径提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a
small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian
substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be
engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and
is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature
dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular
circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative
medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and
gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred
direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding
electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force
can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall
current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the
resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional
current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation
characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals
a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link
between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new
possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.

*J. Boy,R. Mitdank,A. Popp,Z. Galazka,S. F. Fischer*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates controlling phonon-drag effects in β-Ga₂O₃ films to enhance thermopower.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermoelectric materials have potential in energy harvesting, and phonon-drag effects can be manipulated for better performance.

Method: Experiments on β-Ga₂O₃ films with controlled thickness showed enhanced thermopower by varying film thickness and analyzing temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients.

Result: Phonon drag enhances thermopower by adjusting film thickness, with a 10x increase in phonon-phonon to electron-phonon relaxation times in confined structures.

Conclusion: Optimizing phonon-drag mechanisms can significantly boost thermopower in thin β-Ga₂O₃ films.

Abstract: Phonon drag may be harnessed for thermoelectric generators and devices. Here,
we demonstrate the geometric control of the phonon-drag contribution to the
thermopower. In nanometer-thin electrically conducting $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
films homoepitaxially-grown on insulating substrates it is enhanced from -0,4
mV/K to up to -3 mV/K at 100 K by choice of the film thickness. Analysis of the
temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients reveal that a crossover from
three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional electron-phonon interaction occurs
for film thicknesses below 75~nm. The ratio of phonon-phonon to electron-phonon
relaxation times in these confined structures is $10$ times larger than that of
bulk. Generally the phonon drag can be tuned depending on the relations between
the phonon-drag interaction length $\lambda_\text{PD}$, the phonon mean free
path $\lambda$ and the film thickness $d$. Phonon drag can be enhanced for
$\lambda_\text{PD}\gg\lambda>d$.

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics defines the ideal quantum thermoelectric, with maximum
possible efficiency at finite power output. However, such an ideal
thermoelectric is challenging to implement experimentally. Instead, here we
consider two types of thermoelectrics regularly implemented in experiments: (i)
finite-height potential barriers or quantum point contacts, and (ii)
double-barrier structures or single-level quantum dots. We model them with
Landauer scattering theory as (i) step transmissions and (ii) Lorentzian
transmissions. We optimize their thermodynamic efficiency for any given power
output, when they are used as thermoelectric heat-engines or refrigerators. The
Lorentzian's efficiency is excellent at vanishing power, but we find that it is
poor at the finite powers of practical interest. In contrast, the step
transmission is remarkably close to ideal efficiency (typically within 15%) at
all power outputs. The step transmission is also close to ideal in the presence
of phonons and other heat-leaks, for which the Lorentzian performs very poorly.
Thus, a simple nanoscale thermoelectric - made with a potential barrier or
quantum point contact - is almost as efficient as an ideal thermoelectric.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of gas sensing in
monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based field-effect transistors (FET)
using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism and Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
approach. Moving beyond conventional density functional theory analyses, our
framework captures the full device level response by incorporating
field-dependent quantum transport and temperature effects. We model the impact
of NO, H$_2$S, HF and CO$_2$ gases on the band structure and density of states
(DOS), carrier concentration, quantum capacitance and I-V characteristics. The
results indicate that CO$_2$ followed by NO induce strongest perturbations via
mid-gap states and band edge shifts, leading to the appearance of asymmetric
Van-Hove singularities with enhanced carrier modulation and quantum
capacitance. It is observed that HF induce moderate perturbation while H$_2$S
induce weakest response for all temperature and biasing condition. It is found
that an applied vertical electric field narrows the band gap via the Stark
effect, further boosting mobility and tunability. Temperature influences
sensing response by enhancing charge transfer at moderate levels and causing
desorption at higher temperatures. We found that CO$_2$ consistently show the
highest sensitivity and selectivity followed by NO and HF, while H$_2$S display
the weakest response. This study offers a comprehensive framework to engineer
h-BN based FET sensors by harnessing intrinsic band modulation and quantum
capacitance for molecule discrimination and temperature optimization.

*Yichen Chu,Qizhong Zhu*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Isotropic trions have dissipationless edge states due to topological protection, enabling dissipationless transport. This could lead to highly efficient optoelectronic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of trions in transition metal dichalcogenides has potential applications in optoelectronic devices. The paper addresses the challenge of creating dissipationless transport for trions, which has been elusive. By proposing a Z2 topological trion insulator, the authors aim to enable such dissipationless transport, which is crucial for high-speed optoelectronic devices.

Method: The authors model the system using a Haldane-like model based on the topological properties of the trions. They analyze the valence band structure and show that the trion sector becomes a Z2 topological insulator when a certain stability condition is met. This involves considering interactions and the moiré potential induced by the twisted layers.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed Z2 topological trion insulator exhibits helical edge states for trions, which are dissipationless. Intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and the application of a moiré potential are shown to stabilize these edge states. The authors also support their findings with numerical calculations, finding good agreement between theory and simulation.

Conclusion: The work opens new avenues for designing high-performance optoelectronic devices by exploiting the topological properties of trions in doped transition metal dichalcogenides. The concept of a Z2 topological trion insulator, supported by both analytical and numerical evidence, provides a promising approach for dissipationless trion transport, which is a critical step towards realizing efficient optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Trions, charged quasiparticles formed by binding an exciton to an excess
charge carrier, dominate the optical response of doped transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), and the study of the transport properties of trions in
TMDs may have application in developing high-speed excitonic and optoelectronic
devices. However, an important building block for low-dissipation
optoelectronic devices that provides dissipationless transport channels for
trions has remained elusive. Here, we propose the concept of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological trion insulator that features helical dissipationless edge states
for trions. This is realized for intralayer trions, which inherit the
valley-orbit coupling of intralayer excitons in TMDs subject to a moir\'e
periodic potential. We find that under certain circumstances, the moir\'e trion
band becomes topological, characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
number. We further provide two specific material realizations of this
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator: a doped monolayer TMD placed on top of a
twisted hBN substrate, and a generic twisted TMD heterobilayer. We also examine
the effect of charge screening and find that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
trion insulator remains robust. Our work paves the way toward realizing
dissipationless excitonic devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discusses the skyrmion Hall effect in bilayer magnetic skyrmions, showing that certain types exhibit a finite Hall angle due to spin-orbit torque, with various effects that are significant for applications like skyrmion racetrack memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I'm interested in how magnetic skyrmions, especially bilayer ones, behave under external influences like spin-orbit torque. Their applications in memory devices are intriguing and this paper seems to offer new insights into their dynamic properties under specific conditions.

Method: The researchers used a general Lagrangian formalism to model the interactions, performed micromagnetic simulations to validate their findings, and derived equations to explain the observed effects such as velocity dependence and Hall angle behavior.

Result: The study found that Bloch-type bilayer skyrmions exhibit a finite Hall angle when driven by spin-orbit torque, whereas Néel-type do not. Additionally, current-induced elliptical deformations were observed with specific orientations of axes and a linear relation between velocity and radius explained by spin-orbit torque. These results align with previous experimental findings and provide a theoretical framework for future applications.

Conclusion: The findings significantly advance the understanding of antiferromagnetic skyrmions and open up possibilities for engineering skyrmion-based memory devices by controlling spin-orbit torque parameters.

Abstract: The commonly believed absence of skyrmion Hall effect for topologically
trivial magnetic skyrmions is reconsidered for bilayer skyrmions in synthetic
antiferromagnets driven by spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques. Using a
general Lagrangian formalism, we show that Bloch-type bilayer skyrmions acquire
a finite Hall angle when driven by spin-orbit torque, while N\'{e}el-type
skyrmions do not, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations. Both types of
skyrmions exhibit current-induced elliptical deformation with minor and major
axes aligned longitudinally and transversely to their velocity, respectively. A
linear relation between velocity and longitudinal radius is derived with a
coefficient proportional to the strength of spin-orbit torque. These effects
are critical for antiferromagnetic skyrmion-based applications such as skyrmion
racetrack memory. The Lagrange equations also reproduce the linear Hall
angle-helicity relation reported by Msiska et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 064015
(2022). An intuitive explanation of the skyrmion Hall effect for arbitrary
helicity based on the antiferromagnetic exchange torque is also provided.

Motivation: Silicon-based quantum dots offer scalability but connectivity limitations. Spin shuttling addresses this by enabling high-fidelity transfer between spins. This paper presents a significant experiment achieving 99.8% fidelity with optimization based on Hamiltonian model.

Method: The method involves constructing a four-level Hamiltonian model to explain observed spin transfer fidelities and dependencies on parameters like tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting.

Result: High-fidelity BB spin shuttling achieved with fidelity of 99.8%. The error sensitivity depends on interdot tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting. Tuning these parameters significantly affects error rates, allowing up to a twenty-fold variation.

Conclusion: This work aids in optimizing spin shuttling systems for scalable quantum computing architectures by understanding parameter sensitivity and implementing a four-level Hamiltonian model.

Abstract: Spin shuttling offers a promising approach for developing scalable
silicon-based quantum processors by addressing the connectivity limitations of
quantum dots (QDs). In this work, we demonstrate high-fidelity bucket-brigade
(BB) spin shuttling in a silicon MOS device, utilizing Pauli Spin Blockade
(PSB) readout. We achieve an average shuttling fidelity of \SI{99.8}{\percent}.
The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot
tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling
up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate. An appropriate four-level
Hamiltonian model supports our findings. These results provide valuable
insights for optimizing high-performance spin shuttling systems in future
quantum architectures.

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices constitute a versatile platform to investigate emergent
phenomena arising from the interplay of strong correlations and topology, while
offering flexible in situ tunability. However, the fabrication of such moir\'e
superlattices is challenging. It is difficult to achieve highly uniform devices
with a precise twist angle because of the unintentional introduction of
heterostrain, twist angle disorder, and angle/lattice relaxation during the
nanofabrication process. This article introduces an optimized,
experience-informed protocol for fabricating high-quality graphene-based
moir\'e superlattice devices, focusing on a modified dry transfer technique.
The transfer process is performed in a highly tunable, custom-built transfer
setup that enables precise position, angle, and temperature control. By
combining rigorous flake selection criteria, pre-cleaned bubble-free bottom
gates, and graphene laser ablation, the moir\'e superlattice is constructed by
deliberately overlaying twisted graphene flakes at a submicron speed at room
temperature. Through precise control of the transfer process, the resulting
graphene moir\'e superlattice devices exhibit high uniformity and desired twist
angles. This optimized protocol addresses existing challenges in the
fabrication of graphene-based moir\'e superlattice devices and paves the way
for further advances in the rapidly evolving field of moir\'e materials.

TL;DR: This paper discusses how inorganic scintillators in electromagnetic calorimeters can achieve better energy resolution and interaction efficiency by considering their lattice orientations, especially in the strong field regime for high-energy particles. The OREO team is developing a prototype calorimeter based on this concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets the improvement of electromagnetic calorimeters by considering lattice effects, which is crucial for high-energy physics and astrophysics applications with better resolution and efficiency.

Method: The paper uses theoretical modeling and simulations to investigate the strong field regime for particles impinging on high-Z crystals at small angles. Experimental validation is performed with a prototype calorimeter.

Result: The study shows enhanced cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production in the strong field regime, leading to accelerated shower development and improved detector performance. The prototype's potential is demonstrated with a similar resolution to current detectors but with reduced thickness.

Conclusion: The research opens new possibilities for operational calorimeters, beneficial for both accelerator experiments and gamma-ray observatories, by optimizing lattice-oriented scintillators.

Abstract: Although inorganic scintillators are widely used in the design of
electromagnetic calorimeters for high-energy physics and astrophysics, their
crystalline nature and, hence, their lattice orientation are generally
neglected in the detector design. However, in general, the features of the
electromagnetic field experienced by the particles impinging on a crystal at a
small angle with respect to a lattice axis affect their interaction mechanisms.
In particular, in case of electrons/photons of $\mathcal{O} (10~\mathrm{GeV})$
or higher impinging on a high-$Z$ crystal at an angle of $\lesssim
1~\mathrm{mrad}$, the so-called strong field regime is attained: the
bremsstrahlung and pair production cross sections are enhanced with respect to
the case of amorphous or randomly oriented materials. Overall, the increase of
these processes leads to an acceleration of the electromagnetic shower
development. These effects are thoroughly investigated by the OREO (ORiEnted
calOrimeter) team, and pave the way to the development of innovative
calorimeters with a higher energy resolution, a higher efficiency in photon
detection and an improved particle identification capabilities due to the
relative boost of the electromagnetic interactions with respect to the hadronic
ones. Moreover, a detector with the same resolution as the current state of the
art and reduced thickness could be developed. An overview of the lattice
effects at the foundation of the shower boost and of the current status of the
development of an operational calorimeter prototype are presented. This concept
could prove pivotal for both accelerator fixed-target experiments and
satellite-borne $\gamma$-ray observatories.

TL;DR:  paper discusses the design and evaluation of an ASIC for 3FI X-ray fluorescence imaging. The ASIC has high resolution and low power consumption, suitable for various applications in biology, environment, and material science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  researchers often need high-resolution and low-power X-ray fluorescence imaging for detailed analysis of samples, especially in biological and environmental contexts. Developing an efficient detector like this can significantly enhance the capabilities of X-ray fluorescence microscopy.

Method:  The research involved designing an ASIC for 3FI, describing its architecture and components, and testing its performance in terms of energy resolution and power consumption. No figure mentions, so the setup was performed using simulation and experimental measurements under controlled conditions.

Result:  The ASIC achieved excellent energy resolution at 308 eV (30 e- rms) and 138 eV (16 e- rms) for Cu and Ca Kα lines, with a power consumption of 200 μW per pixel. It supports in situ microanalysis and applications like nutrient cycling and microbial studies.

Conclusion:  This ASIC enhances X-ray fluorescence imaging's capability, offering a viable solution with high resolution and low power consumption for various scientific applications. It improves upon traditional microscopy by enabling frameless data acquisition, which is beneficial for high-throughput studies in multiple fields.

Abstract: The design and evaluation on the NSLS-II beamline of the 3FI application
specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bump-bonded to a simply, planar,
two-dimensionally segmented silicon sensor is presented. The ASIC was developed
for Full-Field Fluorescence spectral X-ray Imaging (3FI). It is a small-scale
prototype that features a square array of 32x32 pixels with a pitch of 100
{\mu}m. The ASIC was implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. Each pixel
incorporates a charge-sensitive amplifier, shaping filter, discriminator, peak
detector, and sample-and-hold circuit, allowing detection of events and storing
signal amplitudes. The system operates in an event-driven readout mode,
outputting analog values for threshold-triggered events, allowing high-speed
multi-element X-ray fluorescence imaging. At power consumption of 200 {\mu}W
per pixel, consisting almost uniquely of power dissipated in analog blocks, 308
eV full width at half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution at 8.04 keV, that
corresponds to 30 e- rms equivalent noise charge (ENC) and 138 eV FWHM energy
resolution at 3.69 keV (16 e- rms ENC) were obtained, for Cu and Ca K{\alpha}
lines, respectively. Each pixel operates independently, and the detector
enables in situ trace element microanalysis in biological and environmental
research. Its architecture addresses limitations of X-ray Fluorescence
Microscopy (XFM), typically requiring mechanical scanning, by offering
frame-lees data acquisition, translating to high-throughput operation. The 3FI
ASIC is suitable for example for studies of nutrient cycling in the
(mycor)rhizosphere, microbial redox processes, and genotype-phenotype
correlations in bio-energy crops. Additional performances, such as enhanced
spatial resolution can be further improved with coded-aperture and Wolt,
extending the use to environmental, biomedical, and material science studies.

Abstract: We present a Virtual Frisch-Grid geometry-based CZT gamma detector developed

Abstract: We present a multi-scale optimal control framework for active seismic
isolation in the Einstein Telescope, a third-generation gravitational-wave
observatory. Our approach jointly optimizes feedback and blending filters in a
cross-coupled opto-mechanical system using a unified cost function based on the
"acausal optimum," which quantifies sensor signal-to-noise ratios across
frequencies. This method enables efficient re-optimization under varying sensor
configurations and environmental conditions. We apply the framework to two
candidate sensing systems: OmniSens-a six-degree-of-freedom inertial isolation
system-and BRS-T360, which combines Beam Rotation Sensor (BRS) as an inertial
tilt sensor with T360 as a horizontal seismometer. We demonstrate superior
low-frequency isolation with OmniSens, reducing platform motion by up to two
orders of magnitude near the microseism. The framework allows for ready
optimization and projection of sensor noise to metrics relevant to the
performance of the instrument, aiding the design of the Einstein Telescope.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development and testing of 10 Ge light detectors with NTL amplification for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. The detectors performed well, achieving low leakage current and high signal-to-noise ratios, with potential applications in future experiments like CUPID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutrinoless double-beta decay is a significant area of research in particle physics, and improving detector technology is crucial for such experiments. This paper aims to enhance the performance of detectors using NTL technology.

Method: The study involves the assembly of detectors with large cubic crystals, using a mechanical structure from CROSS, and operating them at milli-Kelvin temperatures. Signal amplification via the NTL method was tested, focusing on leakage current, signal-to-noise ratio, and time response.

Result: The detectors showed minimal leakage current, high signal-to-noise ratios, and fast time responses. The NTL technology was effective in reducing background noise for the CUPID experiment.

Conclusion: The developed detectors demonstrate promising performance for use in experiments like CUPID, indicating their potential for advancing neutrino physics research.

Abstract: As a step towards the realization of cryogenic-detector experiments to search
for neutrinoless double-beta decay (such as CROSS, BINGO, and CUPID), we
investigated a batch of 10 Ge light detectors (LDs) assisted by
Neganov-Trofimov-Luke (NTL) signal amplification. Each LD was assembled with a
large cubic light-emitting crystal (45 mm side) using the recently developed
CROSS mechanical structure. The detector array was operated at milli-Kelvin
temperatures in a pulse-tube cryostat at the Canfranc underground laboratory in
Spain. We achieved good performance with scintillating bolometers from CROSS,
made of Li$_{2}$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystals and used as reference detectors of the
setup, and with all LDs tested (except for a single device that encountered an
electronics issue). No leakage current was observed for 8 LDs with an electrode
bias up to 100 V. Operating the LDs at an 80 V electrode bias applied in
parallel, we obtained a gain of around 9 in the signal-to-noise ratio of these
devices, allowing us to achieve a baseline noise RMS of $O$(10 eV). Thanks to
the strong current polarization of the temperature sensors, the time response
of the devices was reduced to around half a millisecond in rise time. The
achieved performance of the LDs was extrapolated via simulations of pile-up
rejection capability for several configurations of the CUPID detector
structure. Despite the sub-optimal noise conditions of the LDs (particularly at
high frequencies), we demonstrated that the NTL technology provides a viable
solution for background reduction in CUPID.

Abstract: The realization of ultra stable optical frequency transmission through fiber
networks is critical for advancing global optical frequency standards and
enabling applications such as redefining the second in the International System
of Units, geophysical sensing, quantum network construction, and fundamental
physics experiments. However, achieving high reliability and low instability
optical frequency carrier transmission links over distances exceeding thousands
of kilometers remains technically challenging, thereby limiting the scalability
and reliability of such networks. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate
that the noise accumulation in long distance optical links can be mitigated by
narrowband purification of the optical signal's phase noise, enabling optical
links of theoretically unlimited length. Additionally, we implemented digital
optical phase measurement and feedback technology to calibrate noise
compensation deviations caused by inconsistencies in round trip optical
frequencies, enhancing link stability. By adopting digital phase measurement
instead of traditional phase detectors, we expanded the dynamic noise tolerance
range of the optical phase-locked loop, significantly improving system
reliability. Ultimately, on a 2067 km telecommunications fiber link with a
noise level exceeding 5000 rad^2/Hz.km, we achieved an optical frequency
transfer with a daily instability of 2.9 E-21 without experiencing any optical
cycle slips maintaining continuous operation for four days. This work
establishes a technical foundation for leveraging existing fiber resources to

Conclusion: 这种光腔为类脑机和光子计算提供高效解决方案，显著提升性能和能效。

Abstract: The work presents an inverse-designed optical cavity that can direct light
from two sources such that if the sources were to represent any number in the
range [-1,1] with magnitude encoded through the power emitted by the source and
sign by switching the direction of source current, the photocurrent generated
at the two output ports is proportional to the product of the two numbers. Let
us say that the two sources encode x and y, which are two numbers $\in$ [-1,1].
Multiplication is reduced to the form $(x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 4xy \propto xy$. The
addition and subtraction operations of the numbers are supported by
constructive and destructive interference, respectively. The work shows that
replacing the DDOT dot product engine of the Lightening Transformer with the
optical cavity proposed to calculate the dot product can lead to a reduction in
the area occupied by the photonic core by 88 \%, can reduce the power
consumption by lasers by around 23.43 \%, and bring down energy consumption
while training DeiT models by 0.88 \%. The cavities can generate photocurrents
of the form $1.057 xy + 0.249$ with $R^2=0.88,$ thus showing a relationship of
direct proportionality between the target product $xy$ and the output of the
cavity in response to stimuli encoding $x$ and $y$.

Abstract: Microscopes face a trade-off between spatial resolution, field-of-view, and
frame rate -- improving one of these properties typically requires sacrificing
the others, due to the limited spatiotemporal throughput of the sensor. To
overcome this, we propose a new microscope that achieves snapshot
gigapixel-scale imaging with a sensor array and a diffractive optical element
(DOE). We improve the spatiotemporal throughput in two ways. First, we capture
data with an array of 48 sensors resulting in 48x more pixels than a single
sensor. Second, we use point spread function (PSF) engineering and compressive
sensing algorithms to fill in the missing information from the gaps surrounding
the individual sensors in the array, further increasing the spatiotemporal
throughput of the system by an additional >5.4x. The array of sensors is
modeled as a single large-format "super-sensor," with erasures corresponding to
the gaps between the individual sensors. The array is placed at the output of a
(nearly) 4f imaging system, and we design a DOE for the Fourier plane that
generates a distributed PSF that encodes information from the entire
super-sensor area, including the gaps. We then computationally recover the
large-scale image, assuming the object is sparse in some domain. Our
calibration-free microscope can achieve ~3 {\mu}m resolution over >5.2 cm^2
FOVs at up to 120 fps, culminating in a total spatiotemporal throughput of 25.2
billion pixels per second. We demonstrate the versatility of our microscope in
two different modes: structural imaging via darkfield contrast and functional
fluorescence imaging of calcium dynamics across dozens of freely moving C.
elegans simultaneously.

Abstract: Analog computing using bosonic computational states is a leading approach to
surpassing the computational speed and energy limitations of von Neumann
architectures. But the challenges of manufacturing large-scale photonic
integrated circuits (PIC) has led to hybrid solutions that integrate optical
analog and electronic digital components. A notable example is the coherent
Ising machine (CIM), that was primarily invented for solving quadratic binary
optimization problems. In this paper, we focus on a mean-field interpretation
of the dynamics of optical pulses in the CIM as solutions to Langevin dynamics,
a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that plays a key role in non-convex
optimization and generative AI. This interpretation establishes a computational
framework for understanding the system's operation, the computational role of
each component, and its performance, strengths, and limitations. We then infer
that the CIM is inherently a continuous state machine, capable of integrating a
broad range of SDEs, in particular for solving a continuous global (or mildly
constrained) optimization problems. Nevertheless, we observe that the iterative
digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversions within the protocol create
a bottleneck for the low power and high speed of optics to shine. This
observation underscores the need for major advances in PIC technologies as we
envision that fully analog opto-electronic realizations of such experiments can
open doors for broader applications, and orders of magnitude improvements in
speed and energy consumption.

Abstract: Optical imaging below the limit of light diffraction offers an unprecedented
opportunity to study outlook, organization, interactions or in-situ functioning
of sub-micrometer, highly transparent objects such as subcellular structures in
vitro, thin layers or nano-engineered devices. However, most of current
methodologies require to use specially designed luminescent labels, which not
only may affect the properties of the sample itself, but often are
(photo)toxic, susceptible to photobleaching, offer limited color combinations
or specificity of labeling. Moreover, the dedicated fluorescence based
super-resolution optical techniques are often technically complex and
cumbersome to use. The existing non-destructive, non-invasive and label-free
super-resolution imaging (SRI) methods are also challenging, complex and
elusive to apply. To address these issues, here we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a new concept of label-free sub-diffraction optical imaging. The
transmission avalanche backlight (TAB) microscopy exploits huge optical
non-linearities of photon avalanching materials, which are acting as a virtual
near-field nano aperture - a diffraction limited backlight of the actual
sample. Such approach enables to augment imaging contrast of highly transparent
samples and thin layers, by translating small attenuation and scattering loses
occurring on these translucent samples into amplified modulation of
luminescence intensity of the avalanche backlighted substrate (ABS). At no
additional cost, sub-diffraction imaging is achieved with simple, single beam
laser scanning microscopy setup, leading to ca. 70 nm optical resolution. This
far-field, label-free, raster scanning imaging technique, with augmented
contrast and optical imaging resolution below diffraction limit, may become
pivotal for studies in biology, physics, materials science, nanophotonics and
nanoengineering

Motivation: The need for efficient, low-loss, and high-performance photonic switches is significant for applications in optical communication systems, optical computing, and integrated photonic circuits.

Method: The researchers utilized the high confinement of optical and electrical fields in silicon slot waveguides and coupled it with a strong electro-optic effect of nematic liquid crystals. They designed a photonic directional coupler switch, optimized for 1.5 mm length, which operates effectively at 1550 nm wavelength.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in inverse design by proposing a robust framework using CVAE and tandem network. This is beneficial for applications in nanophotonics where precise control of photonic structures is crucial.

Method: The method involves using a CVAE to adjust target spectra, ensuring they are physically realizable, followed by a tandem network to predict structural parameters. This approach unites spectral adjustment with structural prediction in a single architecture, improving efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The framework successfully handles both narrowband and highly complex spectra, achieving accurate designed spectra matching full-wave simulations. This validates the practicality for advanced nanophotonic applications.

Conclusion: Overall, this framework offers a viable solution to the challenges in inverse design, demonstrating its practical potential through comprehensive testing with various spectrum types.

Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics remains challenging due to its ill-posed
nature and sensitivity to input inaccuracies. We present a novel framework that
combines a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with a tandem network,
enabling robust and efficient on-demand inverse design of photonic structures.
Unlike prior approaches that use CVAEs or tandem networks in isolation, our
method integrates spectral adjustment and structural prediction in a unified
architecture. Specifically, the CVAE adjusts the idealized target spectra, such
as Lorentzian-shaped notches, making them more physically realizable and
consistent with the training data distribution. This adjusted spectrum is then
passed to the tandem network, which predicts the corresponding structural
parameters. The framework effectively handles both narrowband (<50 nm) and
highly complex spectra, while addressing the one-to-many mapping challenge
inherent in inverse design. The model achieves high accuracy, and the designed
spectra closely match full-wave simulation results, validating its practicality
for advanced nanophotonic applications.

Abstract: Light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained
significant interest due to their distinctive optical and electronic
properties. Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D
materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In
this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical
limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450
nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the
number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from
(3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm
GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a
strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally,
monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2,
outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises
from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate
nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that
liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen
vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA.
These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency
optical limiters using 2D silicates.

Abstract: We implement an integrated multi-electrode array on a silicon-nitride-based
photonic integrated circuit for ex-vivo retinal characterization via optical
stimulation. The interrogation beam formers, based on curved grating emitters
and optical phased arrays, are designed to achieve transverse focusing with
spot sizes in the 1 - 2 $\mu$m range to target single cells. The experimentally
realized focusing optical phased arrays show suppressed side-lobes, with
approximately 11.5% of the power in each side-lobe and ~60% in the main lobe,
reducing unintentional cellular excitation. Additional design refinement
enables further suppression of the side-lobes to a few percent of the total
power. Additionally, we demonstrate a compact design of meandered thermal phase
shifters implemented across the array that allow push-pull steering in the
transverse direction as well as focusing and defocusing of the beam, with a
total of only four control signals. Transverse angular steering by
$\pm$5.1{\deg} and axial translation of the focal spot by 204 $\mu$m are
demonstrated with tuning currents below 50 mA, together with longitudinal
angular steering by 4.26{\deg} obtained by means of wavelength tuning in a

Abstract: A method is presented to use a fiber-optic device known as a photonic lantern

aspheric, and freeform optical surfaces. By modulating input intensity and

Abstract: We propose a novel type of topological excitation topological event
wavepackets (TEWs) emerging in photonic spacetime crystals (STCs) with
spacetime modulated dielectric constants. These TEWs exhibit strong
spatiotemporal localization and are topologically protected by a fully opened
energy momentum ({\omega}k) gap, within which conventional steady states are
absent. We further demonstrate that TEWs are spectrally confined within the
{\omega}k-gap, providing a combined measurement for probing the emergence of
TEW and the {\omega}k-gap size. Furthermore, we construct a spacetime winding
number to elucidate the protection of these events. Unlike previously reported
nolinearity-induced event solitons, TEWs originate from topological
configuration for linear media, thereby more accessible and versatile for
experimental realization. Moreover, we show that TEWs can be periodically woven
to form an event lattice, enabling to suppress unwanted noise amplification.
Our findings open a new pathway toward topological control in photonic
spacetime-modulated systems, enabling the {\omega}k-gap band enginering for
wave manipulation ranging from microwave to optical regimes.

Abstract: Anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors recently have emerged as a
promising platform for polarization-controlled Raman amplification. In this
study, we probe energy-dependent resonant Raman scattering in few layer ReS2
under different polarization configurations. We identify two distinct
excitation regimes, each characterized by a resonance condition where either
the pump or the Stokes photon energy aligns with an excitonic transition. A
two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in Raman intensity is observed when the pump
energy is tuned near the exciton resonance. Under Stokes-resonant conditions,
additional Raman lines accompanied by excitonic photoluminescence are observed,
suggesting the participation of non-Bloch intermediate states in the scattering
process. These findings shed light into the influence of excitons in modulating
nonlinear optical phenomena in anisotropic 2D materials, offering valuable
insights for the design of tunable photonic and optoelectronic devices based on
anisotropic layered materials.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for understanding complex systems,
covering group interactions of different orders beyond traditional pairwise
interactions. This modelling allows for the simplified description of
simultaneous interactions among multiple elements in coupled oscillators, graph
neural networks, and entangled qubits. Here, we employ this generalized
framework to describe wave-matter interactions for material design
acceleration. By devising the set operations for multiparticle systems, we
develop the hypergraph model, which compactly describes wave interferences
among multiparticles in scattering events by hyperedges of different orders.
This compactness enables an evolutionary algorithm with O(N1/2) time complexity
and approximated accuracy for designing stealthy hyperuniform materials, which
is superior to traditional methods of O(N) scaling. By hybridizing our
hypergraph evolutions to the conventional collective-coordinate method, we
preserve the original accuracy, while achieving substantial speed-up in
approaching near the optimum. Our result paves the way toward scalable material
design and compact interpretations of large-scale multiparticle systems.

Motivation: Optical fiber sensing is important for various measurements but lacks the speed and efficiency needed. This paper aims to overcome these limitations through optimizing the system architecture and leveraging advanced computing techniques.

Method: The proposed AOFS-IC system integrates a scattering medium with diffractive optical networks to enable in-sensor computing. This approach allows for direct intensity detection without electronic processing, utilizing light-speed signal demodulation and thus reducing latency to just 3 ns, surpassing conventional systems by a factor of 100.

Conclusion: The successful design of AOFS-IC proves the potential of next-generation optical sensing systems for enhanced speed, efficiency, and applicability through fully optical components and all-optical computing.

Abstract: Optical fiber sensing plays a crucial role in modern measurement systems and
holds significant promise for a wide range of applications. This potential,
though, has been fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic latency and power
limitations associated with electronic signal processing. Here, we propose an
all-optical fiber sensing architecture with in-sensor computing (AOFS-IC) that
achieves fully optical-domain sensing signal demodulation at the speed of
light. By integrating a scattering medium with an optimized diffractive optical
network, AOFS-IC enables linear mapping of physical perturbations to detected
intensity, and sensing results can be directly read out without electronic
processing. The proposed system maintains high accuracy across various sensing
tasks, providing sub-nano strain resolution and 100% torsional angle
classification accuracy, as well as multiplexed sensing of multiple physical
quantities, and performing multi-degree-of-freedom robot arm monitoring.
AOFS-IC eliminates computing hardware requirements while providing <3 ns
demodulation delay, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude faster than
conventional fiber optic sensing systems. This work demonstrates the potential
of next-generation optical sensing systems empowered by all-optical computing,
and paves the way for expanded applications of fiber sensing through the
integration of fully optical components, ultrafast measurement speed, and low
power consumption.

*Ofer Neufeld*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that short, linearly-polarized, off-resonant few-cycle laser pulses can induce magnetization changes in solids through time-reversal symmetry breaking, which is coherently controlled by carrier-envelope-phase sensitivity. The magnetization can be switched by adjusting the laser angle and intensity without circular polarization or external fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the use of linearly polarized few-cycle laser pulses to induced magnetization in solids, potentially opening new avenues for ultrafast manipulation of magnetism without the need for circular polarization or external fields.

Method: The study uses ab-initio calculations and experiments to demonstrate that the linear, off-resonant few-cycle laser pulses break time-reversal symmetry, leading to magnetization changes which are sensitive to carrier-envelope phase. Coherent tuning of the CEP allows for control of the induced magnetization's magnitude and sign. Additionally, the magnetization remains significant even when CEP is averaged out, making the effect observable without CEP stabilization.

Result: The findings show that such laser pulses can effectively induce magnetization changes in solids. The magnetization is sensitive to the laser's carrier-envelope phase, allowing for ultrafast control of the induced magnetic properties. Significantly, the magnetization can be achieved with linear polarization, which circumvents the need for circularly polarized driving or external magnetic fields, expanding the possibilities for ultrafast magnetism studies.

Conclusion: This research opens new possibilities for ultrafast coherent manipulation and probing of magnetism in solids using temporally asymmetric few-cycle laser pulses without requiring circular polarization or external magnetic fields.

Abstract: Circularly-polarized light is well-known to induce, or flip the direction of,
magnetization in solids. At its heart, this arises from time-reversal symmetry
breaking by the vector potential, causing inverse-Faraday or analogous physical
effects. We show here that very short few-cycle pulses can cause similar
phenomena even when they are linearly-polarized and off-resonant. We analyze
the new effect with ab-initio calculations and demonstrate that it similarly
arises due to broken time-reversal symmetry and is carrier-envelope-phase (CEP)
sensitive. Coherently tuning the CEP causes the induced magnetism to oscillate
from zero to few percent Bohr magneton within few femtoseconds. By changing the
laser angle and intensity, the magnetization sign and magnitude can be
controlled. Remarkably, due to the nature of the physical mechanism that relies
on spin-orbit interactions and orbital currents, the magnetization survives
CEP-averaging and the effect should be accessible even in the absence of CEP
stabilization. Our work opens new routes for ultrafast coherent tuning and
probing of magnetism and circumvents the need for circularly-polarized driving
or external magnetic fields.

Abstract: The transport of excitons lies at the heart of excitonic devices. Probing,
understanding, and manipulating excitonic transport represents a critical step
prior to their technological applications. In this work, we report experimental
studies on the ultrafast nonlinear transport of excitons in monolayer WS2.
Under intense optical pumping, we observed an ultrafast spatial hole burning
effect in the excitonic emission profile, followed by a re-brightening at even
higher pumping density. By means of time- and spatially-resolved
photoluminescence imaging spectroscopy, we revealed the underlying mechanism
responsible for these nontrivial excitonic diffusion dynamics. Our results
demonstrate that the combined effects of ultrafast exciton-exciton
annihilation, efficient hole trapping by intrinsic sulfur vacancy defects, and
laser-induced photo-oxidation govern the evolution of exciton transport under
strong optical excitation. The observed dynamics are in excellent agreement
with our diffusion model simulations, providing new insights into the nonlinear
excitonic transport behaviors as well as their optical control mechanism in
two-dimensional semiconductors.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to shape electron wave packets using femtosecond pulses, enabling precise control over their time, spatial, and spectral aspects for advanced imaging and diffraction experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for better control over electron wave packets in ultrafast imaging and diffraction, similar to how optical pulses are shaped for quantum phenomena.

Method: They use quantum phase modulation of electron waves with light pulses that have time-dependent frequency to create spectrally separated electron energy side bands with specific time-energy profiles.

Result: Achieved few femtosecond time durations without spectral broadening, allowing high-resolution imaging limited only by spatial and temporal control.

Conclusion: This method opens new possibilities for precise ultrafast electron wave packet manipulation in imaging and diffraction.

Abstract: Coherent control of ultrafast quantum phenomena benefits from the
pulse-shaping capabilities allowing to modulate the envelope and instantaneous
phase of optical fields on femtosecond time scales. While such control is
available for optical fields, an analogy of a pulse shaper for freely
propagating electrons is lacking. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate a
method that enables near arbitrary light-based shaping of electron wave packets
in the time domain. The method is based on the quantum phase modulation of
electron waves by coherent light with time-dependent frequency leading to
generation of spectrally separated electron energy side bands with shaped
time-energy profiles and envelopes. Our results show that few femtosecond time
durations can be achieved without additional spectral broadening of the
electron wave packet, allowing one to reach the combination of high time,
spatial, and spectral resolutions in ultrafast imaging and diffraction
experiments with pulsed electron beams.

Abstract: Plasmonic Janus particles, comprising dielectric cores with thin metallic
caps, exhibit complex optical properties due to their asymmetric structure.
Despite applications in active matter research, their orientation-dependent
scattering properties remain largely unexplored. We introduce Fourier plane
tomographic spectroscopy for simultaneous four-dimensional characterization of
scattering from individual micrometer-scale particles across wavelength,
incident angle, scattering angle, and polarization. Combining measurements with
finite-element simulations, we identify discrete spectral markers in visible
and near-infrared regions that evolve predictably with cap orientation.
Spherical-harmonics decomposition reveals these markers arise from three
distinct multipolar modes up to fifth order: axial-propagating
transverse-electric, transverse-propagating transverse-electric, and
transverse-propagating axial-electric, with retardation-induced splitting. We
observe progressive red-shifts and linewidth narrowing of higher-order
resonances, demonstrating curvature's influence on mode dispersion.
Orientation-specific scattering patterns exhibit polarization-dependent
features enabling optical tracking of particle rotation. Our framework applies
to diverse material combinations and geometries, offering a toolkit for
designing orientation-responsive nanoantennas, reconfigurable metasurfaces, and
active colloidal systems with tailored light-matter interactions.

TL;DR: The paper discusses photonic time crystals, showing how nanophotonic structures can achieve wide momentum bandgaps even with small modulation amplitudes by enhancing interaction time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in observing photonic time crystals at optical frequencies is highlighted due to the high required modulation of material properties. The paper proposes a novel approach using nanophotonic structures to overcome this limitation.

Method: The authors use nanophotonic structures composed of scatterers that support quasi-bound states in the continuum. This method allows them to reduce the necessary modulation amplitude by increasing the interaction time between light and time-varying matter.

Result: Extremely wide momentum bandgaps are observed, even when the modulation amplitude of the material properties is tiny.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables the realization of photonic time crystals with practical applications, marking a significant step toward their use in optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Photonic time crystals are a class of artificial materials that have only
recently been explored. They are characterized by the ultrafast modulation of
the material properties in time, causing a momentum bandgap for light that
propagates through such novel states of matter. However, the observation of
these unique properties at optical frequencies remains elusive, as the
necessary modulation amplitudes of the permittivity to show notable momentum
bandgaps are relatively high, inaccessible with available materials. While it
has been known that structuring photonic time crystals at the sub-wavelength
scale can enhance the momentum bandgap, we push this concept to the extreme by
leveraging the nanophotonic toolbox. Specifically, we demonstrate that
nanophotonic structures composed of scatterers supporting quasi-bound states in
the continuum can significantly reduce the required amplitude of temporal
permittivity modulation by enhancing the interaction time between light and
time-varying matter. This allows us to observe extremely wide momentum bandgaps
despite the material properties having tiny modulation amplitudes. Our approach
bridges the concepts of bound states in the continuum and time-varying
metamaterials, paving the way toward realizable photonic time crystals at
optical frequencies.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve the spectral resolution in an AWG by introducing a splitter and utilizing the Moiré effect, achieving a 1 GHz channel spacing at 1550 nm. The approach maintains the original AWG layout while reducing device size and sensitivity to phase noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original AWG's spectral resolution is limited by its differential optical path length, leading to larger device sizes and higher phase noise sensitivity. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing an innovative solution involving a splitter and Moiré effect, offering a compact and efficient design for high-resolution AWGs.

Method: The approach involves adding an additional splitter at the AWG input and utilizing the Moiré effect, which arises from two gratings with slight pitch differences. The method allows for significant reduction in the channel spacing to 1 GHz while maintaining the original layout, thereby reducing device footprint and phase noise sensitivity.

Result: The paper successfully designs a super-resolution AWG with 7 channels, achieving a spacing of 1 GHz at 1550 nm. Theoretical models and simulation results are provided to validate the design approach, which also considers practical constraints such as manufacturing limitations, optical intensity, and phase noise.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances spectral resolution in AWGs by introducing an additional splitter and leveraging the Moiré effect, offering a more compact and efficient solution compared to traditional designs. This approach effectively reduces device size and sensitivity to phase noise, making it a promising solution for future high-resolution AWG applications. The theoretical framework and design guidelines provided by the paper facilitate practical implementation and optimization for various optical communication systems.

Abstract: Enhancing spectral resolution in a conventional arrayed waveguide grating AWG
requires a longer differential optical path, which expands the device footprint
and increases sensitivity to phase noise. To overcome this limitation, we
propose an innovative approach that maintains the AWG layout and introduces an
additional splitter at the device input. Leveraging the Moir\`e effect,
generated by two gratings with slightly different pitches, we demonstrate that
the spacing of 7 channels multiplexer/demultiplexer can be reduced to $1$ GHz
at the central wavelength of 1550 nm. We present the theoretical foundation for
a super-resolution AWG and provide the corresponding design guidelines.

Conclusion: 通过介电结构的优化，作者发现了一种新方法来显著提高介电传感器的灵敏度，特别是在角度方向。这种结构不仅在理论上有突破，也适合实际应用，为未来研究光漩涡和其动态行为提供了新方向。

Abstract: Although all-dielectric sensors exhibit minimal absorption and a high figure
of merit (FOM), their sensitivity is significantly lower compared to plasmonic
sensors. One approach to enhancing the sensitivity of dielectric sensors is
utilizing bound states in the continuum (BICs), which are resonant states with
an infinite radiative lifetime. These states are characterized by polarization
vortices in the far field, whose winding number determines the topological
charge. Here, we demonstrate that the position of a BIC polarization vortex in
the k-space has a square-root dependence on changes in the refractive index of
the medium similar to an exceptional point. We compute the angular and spectral
sensitivities of our structure and demonstrate that the angular sensitivity
reaches values comparable to those of surface plasmon polariton (SPP)-based
sensors. We observe a blue spectral shift of BICs as the refractive index of
the surrounding medium increases, a behavior that differs from the conventional
spectral response typically expected under such perturbations. Additionally, we
found a distinct BIC regime exhibiting a pronounced angular sensitivity,
surpassing its spectral one. Our findings pave the way for the development of
dielectric sensors with high angular sensitivity and facilitate the practical
observation of the optical vortex dynamics.
