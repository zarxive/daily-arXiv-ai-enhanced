This is due to soft modes in the underlying Fermi liquid that lead to long-ranged correlations. These correlations in turn yield a nonanalytic dependence of the free energy on the magnetization even at a mean-field level that results in a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. Kirkpatrick and Belitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 124}, 147201 (2020)] have pointed out that one notable exception are non-centrosymmetric metals with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In such materials the spin-orbit interaction gives the relevant soft modes a mass, which inhibits the mechanism leading to a first-order transition. Miserev, Loss, and Klinovaja [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 106}, 134417 (2022)] have claimed that this conclusion does not hold if electron-electron interactions in the particle-particle channel, or 2$\\kF$ scattering processes, are considered. They concluded that this interaction channel leads to soft modes that are not rendered massive by the spin-orbit interaction and again lead to a first-order quantum phase transition.

Starting from an SU(2) $\u03c0$-flux parent state, we construct a continuum theory of Dirac spinons coupled to an SU(2) gauge field and adjoint Higgs fields whose condensates drive transitions to a staggered-flux U(1) spin liquid and a gapless $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced N\u00e9el and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Moderately sized lattices are studied at temperatures $T$ sufficiently low to realize the $T \\to 0$ limit. Results for periodic $L\\times L$ lattices with $L \\in [6,96]$ are tabulated versus $L$ and extrapolations to infinite system size are carried out. The extrapolated ground state energy density is $e_0=-0.669441857(7)$, which represents an improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude over the previously best result. The leading and subleading finite-size corrections to $e_0$ are in full quantitative agreement with predictions from chiral perturbation theory, thus further supporting the soundness of both the extrapolations and the theory. The extrapolated sublattice magnetization is $m_s=0.307447(2)$, which agrees well with previous estimates but with a much smaller statistical error. The coefficient of the linear in $L^{-1}$ correction to $m^2_s$ agrees with the value from chiral perturbation theory and the presence of a factor $\\ln^\u03b3(L)$ in the second-order correction is also confirmed, with the previously not known value of the exponent being $\u03b3= 0.82(4)$. The finite-size corrections to the staggered susceptibility point to logarithmic corrections also in this quantity.

Extending haloscope sensitivity to low axion masses remains challenging due to the large resonator volumes required at sub-GHz frequencies. Re-entrant cavities offer a compact solution, but their performance depends strongly on geometric optimisation. We present a comprehensive finite-element study of re-entrant cavity haloscope designs operating in the 100 to 500 MHz range, comparing their performance using effective scan time as a figure of merit. Among the configurations studied, we identify a double attack geometry that achieves a roughly threefold improvement in effective scan time compared to a conventional single-rod re-entrant cavity. We further investigate practical implementation strategies, including a hybrid design employing one fixed rod and one tunable rod, which preserves a scan time gain while reducing mechanical complexity. These results demonstrate a pathway to enhanced low-mass axion haloscope sensitivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u53cc\u653b\u51fb\u578b\u6709\u65cb\u56de\u8154\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cfQCD\u8f74\u70b9\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u4e9a\u8d6b\u5179\u9891\u6bb5\u8f74\u70b9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8f74\u70b9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6709\u65cb\u56de\u8154\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u653b\u51fb\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u673a\u68b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53cc\u653b\u51fb\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u673a\u68b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8f74\u70b9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the St\u00fcckelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the G\u00f6del metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields.

We argue that a literal equality between the two theories is incompatible with the emergence of Virasoro symmetry in two dimensions. Instead, we propose that the Ising model emerges only as a subsector of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We support this scenario through a detailed study of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ model and by examining operators transforming in irreducible representations of the orthogonal group whose multiplicities become negative for integer values of the spacetime dimension.

Placing these qubits at surfaces maximizes coupling to nearby spins and fields, enabling nanoscale sensing and facilitating integration with photonic and superconducting devices. However, reducing the dimensions or size of established qubit systems without sacrificing the qubit performance or degrading the coherence lifetime remains challenging. Here, we introduce a surface molecular qubit formed by pentacene molecules scaffolded on a two-dimensional (2D) material, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The qubit exhibits stable fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from cryogenic to ambient conditions. With fully deuterated pentacene, the Hahn-echo coherence reaches 22 $\u03bc$s and further extends to 214 $\u03bc$s under dynamical decoupling, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow NV centers in diamond, despite being positioned directly on the surface.

By systematically including correlations beyond the mean-field level, we map the equilibrium phase diagram and identify regimes of coexistence between vortex lattices and multiply charge central vortices. Quench dynamics reveals that macrovortices are robust under changes in rotation or interaction strength, sustaining clean monopole oscillations with well-separated, vorticity-dependent breathing frequencies. In contrast, trap quenches trigger a universal decay process mediated by vortex-phonon coupling, in which rotational energy is progressively transferred to compressible modes until the macrovortex splits into singly quantized vortices. Our results demonstrate that macrovortex lifetimes and decay pathways can be tuned by trap confinement, providing experimentally accessible signatures of vortex-phonon interactions and collective energy transfer in correlated quantum fluids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u73bb\u8272\u6c14\u4f53\u4e2d Mexican-hat\u52bf\u4e0b\u5b8f\u89c2\u6da1\u65cb\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u8870\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6da1\u65cb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u58f0\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u914d\u7f6e\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7eb3\u5165\u591a\u5c42\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6da1\u65cb\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b8f\u89c2\u6da1\u65cb\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u5f3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u9ad8\u6da1\u65cb\u5076\u8054\u81f3\u5355\u6da1\u65cb\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u914d\u7f6e\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u529f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u6da1\u65cb\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6da1\u65cb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

While ODT is well established for imaging thin, weakly scattering samples, it encounters significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous, strongly scattering thick samples such as tissues and organoids. In this work, a novel common-path interferometric approach to ODT is presented, specifically designed for the RI reconstruction of heterogeneous and highly scattering samples at high temporal stability. The proposed technique, termed lateral shearing (LS)-ODT, incorporates partial lateral shearing off-axis interferometry to suppress the effects of multiple scattering, similar to the mechanism in differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, which is widely used for imaging thick specimens. Additionally, the LS-ODT system uses dynamic speckle illumination to enhance both spatial phase and RI sensitivity compared to laser-based ODT systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on a cell phantom. Its robustness and accuracy are further validated across a wide range of samples, including mouse kidney tissue sections and brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in both thin and thick sections. Furthermore, correlative fluorescence and RI tomography of the organoids highlights the potential of LS-ODT to enhance and support a broad spectrum of biomedical studies, particularly in the field of histology.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel lateral shearing (LS)-based optical diffraction tomography (ODT) method is presented for imaging heterogeneous, high scattering samples like tissues with high temporal stability.", "motivation": "ODT is important for label-free refractive index reconstruction, but struggles with thick, scattering samples.

Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping.

In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models.

The system employs Cherenkov-based gamma-ray detection modules arranged around the target or patient, operated in time coincidence with a fast plastic beam monitor (described in a separate paper). This work focuses on the design and comprehensive characterization of the gamma-ray detection module. It consists of a monolithic PbF$_2$ crystal (2 $\\times$ 1.5 $\\times$ 1.5 cm$^{3}$) coupled to a 2 $\\times$ 2 SiPM matrix from Hamamatsu. A series of beam tests at different clinical facilities (MEDICYC and ProteusOne in France, CNAO in Italy) enabled the determination of the detector time resolution under various conditions, with values ranging from 222 to 283 ps FWHM (Full Width Half Maximum). Monte Carlo simulations including the optical response of PbF$_2$ allowed for the determination of the detection efficiency as a function of particle type and energy. For the final TIARA prototype, which will be composed of 30 modules, an overall detection efficiency of 0.45% is expected. Comparison with experimental data confirmed that the modules are effectively insensitive to neutrons, yielding an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with an estimated SNR of 17 for a module placed at 25 cm from the 148 MeV proton beam axis.

While dimer-monomer bound states are manifested as a single particle attached to dimer bound pair, it is still unclear about quantum walks and Bloch oscillations of dimer-monomer bound states. Here, we revisit three-particle bound states in the Bose-Hubbard model and find that interaction-induced impurities adjacent to bound pair and boundaries cause two kinds of bound states: one is dimer-monomer bound state and the other is bound edge states. In quantum walks, the spread velocity of dimer-monomer bound state is determined by the maximal group velocity of their energy band, which is much smaller than that in the single-particle case.

Starting from state-averaged complete active space self consistent field references, this approach produces highly accurate excitation energies for states dominated by a single doubly excited determinant, as well as states in glyoxal and similar molecules where two different doubly excited determinants have large weights.

The number of pigments in the mutant CPC is identical to that in the wild-type APC, and their spatial arrangements are similar. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the mutant CPC closely resemble those of the wild-type CPC rather than the wild-type APC, indicating that pigment spatial arrangement is not a primary factor in determining the excited-state energy structure. The 2D-ES measurements show that the wild-type CPC retains broad positive signals at 1 ps, signifying incomplete relaxation and persistence of excited vibronic states, unlike APC, which vibrationally relaxes to the bottom of the potential energy surface within the same timeframe. The mutant CPC behaves similarly to the wild-type CPC in the 2D-ES, reinforcing that the pigment number or arrangement is not a dominant factor. Instead, the local pigment-protein interaction governs the electronic structure and relaxation dynamics.

We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom.

A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \\pm 1.5 \u00b0$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet \"surfs\", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u81ea\u7531-standing graphene\u4ecb\u4e8e\u6c34\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u89d2\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u673a\u68b0\u5e94\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 graphene \u7684\u6da6\u6e7f\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1 graphene \u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d ab initio\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u6c34\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u89d2\u4e3a 72.1 \u00b1 1.5 \u5ea6\uff0c\u63a5\u89e6\u89d2\u663e\u8457\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e graphene \u7684\u529b\u5b66\u5e94\u53d8\uff0c\u6269\u5f20\u5e94\u53d8\u589e\u52a0\u6c34\u7684\u758f\u6c34\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u538b\u7f29\u5e94\u53d8\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6c34\u5206\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u63a5\u89e6\u89d2\u7684\u89c6\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3 graphene \u7684\u6da6\u6e7f\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u6d78\u6da6\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e graphene \u7684\u5fae\u7eb3\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-\u03b1r^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation.

The real part of the second Tsallis entropy displays a spectral form factor-like dip-ramp-plateau throughout the chaotic window and a suppressed ramp in the localized regime.

In the simplest one-dimensional ($1d$) traps, these interactions decay as a power-law with distance $1/r^\u03b1$, with a tunable exponent $\u03b1$. For small $\u03b1$, the resulting long-range $1d$ XY model exhibits continuous symmetry breaking, in marked contrast to its nearest neighbor counterpart. In this paper, we examine this model near the phase transition at $\u03b1_c$ from the lens of the spin stiffness, or superfluid density. We develop a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation and a generalized winding number estimator to measure the superfluid density in the presence of power-law interactions, which we test against exact diagonalization for small lattice sizes.

Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected.

First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection.

Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches.

The FEXI outcome, the recovery of diffusion coefficient in cells with impermeable membrane is multiexponential, tightly related to the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. Fitting the commonly used exponential recovery function results in a strong dependence of the apparent exchange time on the involved mixing time interval. For short mixing times, exchange time is of the order of 10 ms. It gets an order of magnitude larger for mixing times of a few hundreds of milliseconds. To obtain an estimate of membrane permeability, we reinterpret previously published data on preexchange lifetime in neuronal cell culture. It results in the permeability 0.005 micrometer/ms.

In this topical review, we discuss recent developments of coupled-wire description in nanoscale systems, where it emerges not only as a theoretical tool but also as a highly tunable physical platform. In these nanoscale realizations, coupled-wire networks are formed by one-dimensional channels embedded in two-dimensional materials, most prominently in moir\u00e9 and twisted structures. Such networks host a broad range of unconventional states of matter, including superconductivity, charge density waves, spin density waves, Mott insulating phases, Anderson insulating phases, quantum spin Hall states, quantum anomalous Hall states, and their fractionalized counterparts. The ability to electrically control interaction strength, confinement, and coupling between wires makes these systems qualitatively different from earlier realizations and allows continuous tuning between competing phases. Notably, recent work has demonstrated that the coupled-wire framework in moir\u00e9 networks completes the trio of quantum Hall phenomena, encompassing quantum Hall, quantum spin Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall states, together with their fractional analogues.

The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\\left(\\frac{\u03c1(r)}{\u03c1_{\\star}}\\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $\u03c1(r)=\\frac{\u03c1_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{\u03b1^2}\\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\\frac{K_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{\u03b1^2}\\right)^{1/2}}$.

We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \\pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents an analytic model of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with a scale-dependent equation of state to explain rotation curves of various low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals, and dwarf galaxies that challenge cold dark matter (CDM) descriptions.

While the model is promising for explaining a subset of galaxies, it falls short of providing a complete explanation for all cases, particularly in reproducing the canonical Tully-Fisher relation."}}

Diamond is an especially attractive material for quantum devices because it can host atomic-scale defects that emit single photons and store quantum information with exceptional stability. However, fabricating the optical structures needed to control light in diamond typically relies on slow, bespoke processes that are difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing. These masks define large arrays of nanoscale optical structures, shifting the most demanding pattern-definition steps away from the diamond substrate, improving uniformity, yield, and throughput. Using this method, we demonstrate hundreds of diamond \"quantum microchiplets\" with improved optical performance and controlled interaction with quantum emitters. The chiplet format allows defective devices to be replaced and enables integration with existing photonic and electronic circuits. Our results show that high-quality diamond quantum devices can be produced using scalable, foundry-compatible techniques. This approach provides a practical pathway toward large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies built on established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Ferromagnetism emerges at low fillings from the flat band and persists to stronger interactions and higher fillings via a double-exchange mechanism, where spins align to avoid Hund-rule penalties at the expense of Dirac-fermion kinetic energy.

However, the experimental validation of robust inter-cell interactions in Moire photonic structures and the modulation of flatbands for specific photonic applications remain challenging. Here, we propose a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity and demonstrate nanolasers enabled by strong flatband coupling. In contrast to a twist-angle Moire cavity, a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity provides a stable flatband frequency and a substantial enhancement in Q factor compared to an isolated single-cell cavity, as the unit-cell size decreases. The photonic band-structure measurement of the small-unit-cell Moire cavity by photoluminescence reveals pronounced flatbands. Cell-resolved spectroscopy further confirms the presence of flatbands by identifying resonant peaks that consistently emerge across unit cells in a Moire cavity with a lattice mismatch of 102 nm, but not in a larger-unit-cell Moire cavity with a mismatch of 60 nm. Furthermore, mode selection is achieved by reducing the center-hole size, thus isolating the hexapole mode from the degenerate dipole modes while maintaining strong inter-cell coupling. Consequently, we demonstrate a low-threshold hexapole flatband laser in a single mode. Therefore, the systematic modification of the relative lattice parameters of the two constituent lattices offers a promising strategy for developing Moire nanolasers and flatband nanophotonic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While experimental and theoretical methods have advanced our understanding of mechanochemical processes, predicting where energy concentrates within a molecule remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SITH (Splitting Intramolecular Tension due to stretcHing), a novel method that decomposes the total electronic energy change of a stretched molecule into contributions from individual degrees of freedom -- such as bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals -- using numerical integration of the work-energy theorem. Unlike previous approaches that rely on harmonic approximations, SITH provides high accuracy and robustness to study the distribution of energies of stretched molecules up to a first bond cleavage. Although SITH uses 3N-6 degrees of freedom for the energy decomposition, we show that it can work even for ring structures like prolines. We apply SITH to a dataset of tripeptides and demonstrate that glycine and proline exhibit significantly different energy distributions in their Ca-C backbone bonds under tension: glycine stores more energy, making it more prone to rupture, while proline has the opposite behaviour. These findings reveal intrinsic differences in mechanochemical susceptibility across amino acids, offering more accurate predictions of bond rupture in proteins, and similarly in other (bio)polymers.

Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_\u03c7$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities.

Multi-angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), which assigns independent parameters to each Hamiltonian operator term, achieves superior approximation performance even with fewer layers than standard QAOA. Unfortunately, this increased expressibility can raise the classical computational cost due to a greater number of parameters. The recently proposed Layerwise MA-QAOA (LMA-QAOA) reduces this overhead by training one layer at a time, but it may suffer from obtaining the precise solution due to the previously fixed parameters. This work addresses two questions for efficient MA-QAOA training: (i) What is the optimal granularity for parameter updates per epoch, and (ii) How can we get precise final cost function results while only partially updating the parameters per epoch? Despite the benefit of reducing the parameters that update per epoch can reduce the classical computation overhead, too fine or coarse a granularity of Hamiltonian update can degrade the MA-QAOA training efficiency. We find that optimizing one complete layer per epoch is an efficient granularity. Moreover, selectively retraining each layer by tracking gradient variations can achieve a final cost function equivalent to the standard MA-QAOA while lowering the parameter update overhead. Based on these insights, we propose Orbit-QAOA, which cyclically revisits layers and selectively freezes stabilized parameters. Across diverse graph benchmarks, Orbit-QAOA reduces training steps by up to 81.8%, reduces approximation ratio error by up to 72x compared to the unified stop condition-applied enhanced LMA-QAOA, and achieves equivalent approximation performance compared to the standard MA-QAOA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Orbit-QAOA\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5404\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Orbit-QAOA\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u7684MA-QAOA\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This integrated platform provides a unified workflow that addresses sample heterogeneity, throughput demands, and delivery efficiency, enabling broader implementation of non-viral gene delivery into primary cells for research and translational applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u65bc\u65cb\u6e2aassisted \u7535\u52a8\u6355\u83b7\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u512a\u5316\u89e3 Datenschellar, \u63d0\u4f9b agree_colors, \u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8 delivery efficiency in h merchandise", "motivation": "\u6587\u7ae0\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u75c5\u6bd2\u57fa\u56e0 delivery \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728 primary human cells \u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65cb\u6e2aassisted \u7535\u52a8\u6355\u83b7\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7d50\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u9078\u64c7\u6027\u7d30\u80de\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u6700\u4f73 runnable optimization across buffer and electrical conditions", "result": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 cell heterogeneity, \u63d0\u9ad8 throughput, \u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8f6c\u8fd0 plasmid DNA \u548c in vitro-transcribed mRNA", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709 broader implementation potential \u57fa\u65bc primary human cells \u5728 research \u548c translational applications \u4e2d\u7684\u61c9\u7528"}}

Here, we demonstrate free-space optical modulators based on imprinted BTO metasurfaces with targeted designs for optical and electric field confinement within the active material. With resonances exhibiting high quality factors of up to 200, we demonstrate improved transmission modulation at sub-volt driving amplitudes and frequencies up to 5 MHz. Additional enhancement is achieved via ferroelectric domain alignment, resulting in up to 25 % higher modulation strength compared to the unbiased case and up to 75 % compared to previous demonstrations.

In this work, we overcome these challenges and report single-crystal diffuse neutron scattering from hydrothermally grown Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ -- the highest quality crystals obtained to date for the Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ family. In contrast to the broad diffuse scattering observed in Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, we find highly structured diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ featuring strong intensities along the Brillouin zone boundaries.

While conventional thermodynamic probes can identify these critical points in bulk Ising metamagnets, achieving this in the two-dimensional (2D) limit, where enhanced fluctuation effects can substantially modify critical phenomena, remains to be realized. Here, we combine specific heat capacity (C_V) and magnetic circular dichroism measurements to identify these critical points, extract a tricritical exponent, and map out the complete magnetic phase diagram of 2D Ising metamagnetic CrI3. This is achieved in a nanomechanical device of 6-layer CrI3, in which a direct measurement of the temperature derivative of its mechanical resonance frequency gives C_V. The tricritical point is identified by the onset of an abrupt spin-flip transition on one side and, on the other side, by a vanishing specific heat \u03bb-anomaly for a continuous AF phase transition.

While the positive $\u039b$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $\u039b$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Within this framework, quarks interact with the gluon knot via abelian-dominated color-electric fields, which are squeezed into flux tubes by the dual Meissner effect, leading naturally to quark confinement.

In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC.

A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors.

For a finite region of infrared initial conditions, the RG trajectories remain regular at all scales and approach this fixed point.

In model~I, a Bondi-type mass model described by the asymptotic mass $\u03bc_c$, horizon mass $\u03bc_H$, and profile slope $\u03bb$, it is found that the absorption cross section increases with steeper $\u03bb$, larger $\u03bc_c$ (especially at higher frequencies), or smaller $\u03bc_H$. The differential scattering cross section in this model shows the strongest dependence on the horizon mass $\u03bc_H$. When $\u03bc_H$ exceeds a critical value for a fixed incoming wave frequency $\u03c9$, no partial wave transmits into the black hole, flattening the differential scattering cross section as a function of angle before it increases again with further increase of $\u03bc_H$. Model~II, which considers a truncated accretion region outside some radius $r_0$, contains a potential well in its effective scattering potential. Its absorption cross section decreases in the low-frequency region as the accretion radius $r_0$ decreases, and more importantly, it shows resonance peaks at the quasibound wave frequencies due to resonances induced by the potential well. The differential scattering cross sections show dips around intermediate scattering angles when the parameters (mainly $\u03bc_H$ and $\u03c9$) are such that the resonantly scattered and non-resonant waves interfere destructively around these angles. In both models, absorption exhibits a zero-absorption band as $\u03c9$ approaches $\u03bc_c$ from above, and in both absorption and scattering, the effects of the parameters are found to diminish in the high-frequency limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5438\u6536\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5438\u6536\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5438\u6536\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578bI\u7684\u5438\u6536\u622a\u9762\u968f\u659c\u7387\u03bb\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\u65f6\u03bcc\u5927\u3001\u03bcH\u5c0f\u3002\u6a21\u578bII\u7684\u5438\u6536\u622a\u9762\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u65f6\u968fr0\u51cf\u5c0f\u800c\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5171\u632f\u5cf0\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\u663e\u793a\u5171\u632f\u5cf0\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5438\u6536\u5448\u73b0\u96f6\u5438\u6536\u5e26\uff1b\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u65f6\u6a21\u578bII\u7684\u5438\u6536\u622a\u9762\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u5171\u632f\u5cf0\uff1b\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u9891\u4e0b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5438\u6536\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u51cf\u5f31\u3002"}}

A crucial aspect of our analysis is the recognition that the apparent horizon volume is not comoving; this requires a consistent accounting of particle exchange across the moving boundary.

Recent work showed that work extraction can be implemented universally, meaning the same implementation works for a large class of input states, while achieving a variable work cost that is optimal for each individual i.i.d. input state. Here, we revisit some techniques leading to derivation of the thermodynamic capacity, and leverage them to construct a thermodynamic implementation of $n$ i.i.d. copies of any time-covariant quantum channel, up to some process decoherence that is necessary because the implementation reveals the amount of consumed work. The protocol uses so-called thermal operations and achieves the optimal per-input work cost for any i.i.d. input state; it relies on the conditional erasure protocol in our earlier work, adjusted to yield variable work. We discuss the effect of the work-cost decoherence. While it can significantly corrupt the correlations between the output state and any reference system, we show that for any time-covariant i.i.d. input state, the state on the output system faithfully reproduces that of the desired process to be implemented.

We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\u03c4)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(\u03c4)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $\u03b3_{\\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 25.91$~K.

We reconsider contextuality from an information-theoretic perspective, focusing on operational models constrained to maintain a single internal state with fixed semantics across multiple contexts. Under this constraint, we show that contextual statistics certify an unavoidable obstruction to classical probabilistic descriptions. Specifically, any classical model that reproduces such statistics must either embed contextual dependence into the internal state or introduce additional external labels carrying nonzero information. This result identifies contextuality as a witness of irreducible information cost in classical representations, rather than as a purely nonclassical anomaly. From this viewpoint, quantum probability emerges as a canonical framework that accommodates contextual operations without requiring explicit contextual encoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\u8bc1\u660e\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5bb9\u7eb3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u518d\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u5d4c\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5bb9\u7eb3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u786e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

We identify dephasing as the primary mechanism enforcing this symmetry, which can be suppressed by intercomponent phase correlations. Consequently, a sufficient condition for realizing a continuous time crystal is a nonlinear quantum self-sustaining system exhibiting quantum synchronization among its constituents. As a concrete example, we demonstrate spontaneous oscillations in a synchronized array of van der Pol oscillators, corroborated by both semiclassical dynamics and the quantum Liouville spectrum. These results reduce the identification of time crystals in many-body systems to the evaluation of only two-body correlations and provide a framework for classifying uncorrelated time crystals as trivial.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The central thesis of this report is that early fault-tolerant quantum computing shifts many of the primary bottlenecks from device physics alone to computer-science-driven system design, integration, and evaluation. While large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers remain a long-term objective, near- and medium-term systems will support early fault-tolerant computation with small numbers of logical qubits and tight constraints on error rates, connectivity, latency, and classical control. How effectively such systems can be used will depend on advances across algorithms, error correction, software, and architecture.

However, the number of qubits available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU) is limited -- motivating the distributed preparation of such states across multiple QPUs as a practical approach to scalability. In this article, we investigate the distributed preparation of $n$-qubit $k$-excitation Dicke states $D(n,k)$ across a general number $p$ of QPUs, presenting a distributed quantum circuit (each QPU hosting approximately $\\lceil n/p \\rceil$ qubits) that prepares the state with communication complexity $O(p \\log k)$, circuit size $O(nk)$, and circuit depth $O\\left(p^2 k + \\log k \\log (n/k)\\right)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction to simultaneously achieve logarithmic communication complexity and polynomial circuit size and depth.

Network nonlocality sharing is witnessed when the quantum values of the network correlations associated with relevant parties simultaneously violate a star-network Bell inequality generated from the given class of bipartite Bell inequalities. We streamline the calculation of the quantum values of the network correlations and derive an analytical expression for the bipartite quantum correlator, valid for arbitrary measurement settings and weak-measurement strengths. The network nonlocality sharing for V\u00e9rtesi inequalities has been studied within the framework, and simultaneous violations are found in $(2,2,6)$ and $(2,2,465)$ cases, with the latter exhibiting greater robustness.

Superconducting quantum processors have demonstrated high-fidelity operations, but on larger devices there is commonly a broad distribution of qualities, with the low-performing tail affecting near-term performance and applications. Here we present an error budgeting procedure for the native two-qubit operation on a 32-qubit superconducting-qubit-based quantum computer, the OQC Toshiko gen-1 system. We estimate the prevalence of different forms of error such as coherent error and control qubit leakage, then apply error suppression strategies based on the most significant sources of error, making use of pulse-shaping and additional compensating gates. These techniques require no additional hardware overhead and little additional calibration, making them suitable for routine adoption. An average reduction of 3.7x in error rate for two qubit operations is shown across a chain of 16 qubits, with the median error rate improving from 4.6$\\%$ to 1.2$\\%$ as measured by interleaved randomized benchmarking. The largest improvements are seen on previously under-performing qubit pairs, demonstrating the importance of practical error suppression in reducing the low-performing tail of gate qualities and achieving consistently good performance across a device.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The existence of the mobility ring is revealed in the non-Hermitian SSH chain by studying of the critical behaviors near the boundary.

Fortunately, there are strong reasons to doubt that wave mechanics can describe the center of mass of systems at or above the Planck scale, thereby jeopardizing the construction of the corresponding Fock space. As a result, systems with masses exceeding the Planck mass would have their center of mass described through classical mechanics, regardless of being able to harbor macroscopic quantum phenomena as observed in the laboratory.

For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $\u03c4(N)=\u0398(\\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics.

In this paper, we introduce a post-selected quantum metrology scenario where the initial state, the dynamics associated with the phase shift, and the post-selection are all inspired by the Hardy paradox. Specifically, we identify an anomalous weak value that is characteristic of both the Hardy paradox and the potential enhancement of sensitivity by the post-selection. We find that the efficiency of the enhancement is reduced when the expectation value associated with the anomalous weak value is different from the inverse of this value. We conclude that the relation between enhanced phase estimation and the Hardy paradox requires a detailed understanding of the relation between weak values and expectation values.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These lecture notes provide an accessible yet rigorous introduction to the foundations of quantum optics, emphasising their relevance to quantum information science and technology. Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of light. Key families of states -- thermal, coherent, and squeezed -- are introduced as paradigmatic examples illustrating the transition from classical to nonclassical behaviour. The concepts of convexity, classicality, and quasiprobability representations are presented as complementary tools for characterising quantumness and defining operational notions such as P-nonclassicality. The discussion extends naturally to Gaussian states, composite systems, and continuous-variable entanglement, highlighting how nonclassicality serves as a resource for generating and quantifying quantum correlations. Theoretical developments are complemented by computational and experimental perspectives, including simulations of optical states using the Python library Strawberry Fields and data analysis from simulated data.
