Abstract: We present numerically exact non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional
Bose gas in quasi-periodic lattice that plays an intermediate role between the
long-ranged order and truly disordered systems exhibiting unusual correlated
phases. Precision control over lattice depth, interaction strength and filling
factor enables the exploration of various correlated phases in a finite
periodic lattice. We investigate the system dynamics when the secondary
incommensurate lattice is abruptly switched on. To solve the many-body
Schroedinger equation, we employ the multiconfigurational time-dependent
Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). The many-body dynamics are analyzed through
distinct measures of the Glauber correlation functions and dynamical
fragmentation. Our study reveals four distinct scenarios of localization
process in the non-equilibrium dynamics. Weakly interacting non-fragmented
superfluid of incommensurate filling in the primary lattice exhibits
collapse-revival dynamics of localization. In contrast, a fragmented superfluid
with commensurate filling exhibits dynamical Mott localization. A strongly
correlated, fully fragmented Mott state shows a subtle competition with
localization introduced by the secondary lattice that merely melts the Mott
correlations. Interestingly, in the fermionized Mott regime, where the density
in each well is fragmented, the intra-dimer correlations exhibit unexpected
robustness. These findings provide new insights into many-body correlation
dynamics and novel localization mechanisms in quasi-periodic lattices, paving
the way for engineering exotic quantum behaviors in ultracold atomic systems.

Abstract: Geometric frustration can significantly increase the complexity and richness
of many-body physics and, for instance, suppress antiferromagnetic order in
quantum magnets. Here, we employ ultracold bosonic $^{39}$K atoms in a
triangular optical lattice to study geometric frustration by stabilizing the
gas at the frustrated upper band edge using negative absolute temperatures. We
find that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength
for the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase
transition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics
of the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from
MI to the ($\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than
a few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \frs case, no
long-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a
significantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence. This
work opens the door to quantum simulations of frustrated systems that are often
intractable by classical simulations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: These lecture notes explain the classification of some simple fermionic
topological phases of matter in a pedestrian manner, with an aim to be
maximally pedagogical = doing things in excruciating detail. We focus on a
many-body perspective, even if many of the models we work with are
non-interacting. We start out with symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases
of free fermions that are protected by U(1) symmetry = topological insulators.
We then look at fermion topological phases that don't even need a symmetry =
topological superconductors, and explain how their classification changes in
presence of spinless time-reversal symmetry. We close by perturbatively
checking which of the 1D topological phases we had found are stable to
interactions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the impact of lattice effects due to heterostrain and relaxation on
the correlated electron physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, by
applying dynamical mean-field theory to the topological heavy fermion model.
Heterostrain is responsible for splitting the 8-fold degenerate flat bands into
two 4-fold degenerate subsets, while relaxation breaks the particle-hole
symmetry of the unperturbed THF model. The interplay of dynamical correlation
effects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a
wide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band
degeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent
maximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully
reproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy
results alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy
of local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy
measurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the
stronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the
electron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and
stability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our
results show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now
be faithfully reproduced and understood.

Abstract: Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal
properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the
simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton
phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by
starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which
condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work
[arXiv:2505.13604], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can
be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper,
we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging
web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases
protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry
fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of
topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the
importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of
matter.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The ability to control and manipulate time-reversal ($T$) symmetry-breaking
phases with near-zero net magnetization is a sought-after goal in spintronic
devices. The recently discovered hexagonal altermagnet manganese telluride
($\alpha$-MnTe) is a prime example. It has a compensated $A$-type
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where the in-plane ferromagnetic (FM)
moments in each layer are stacked antiferromagnetically along the $c$ axis, yet
exhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry
with a vanishingly small $c$-axis FM moment. However, the presence of three
120$^\circ$ separated in-plane magnetic domains presents a challenge in
understanding the origin of AHE and the effective control of the altermagnetic
state. Here we use neutron scattering to show that a compressive uniaxial
strain along the next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn bond direction detwins
$\alpha$-MnTe into a single in-plane magnetic domain, aligning the in-plane
moments along the same direction. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial strain
(-0.2% to 0.1%) significantly sharpens the magnetic hysteresis loop and
switches the sign of the AHE near room temperature. Remarkably, this is
achieved without altering the AFM phase-transition temperature, which can only
be explained by a strain-induced modification of the electronic band structure.
Our work not only unambiguously establishes the relationship between the
in-plane moment direction and the AHE in $\alpha$-MnTe but also paves the way
for future applications in highly scalable, strain-tunable magnetic sensors and
spintronic devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对材料科学中的相变和量子临界点感兴趣，尤其是通过 NMR 测量来研究材料的结构变化。

Method: 使用核磁共振 (NMR) 测量，具体测量了 In(1) 和 In(2) 坐标下的 Knight 偏移随压力的变化。

Result: 沿平面方向的 In(1) Knight 偏移随压力变化较小，这表明该方向上的偶极分量受到抑制，而沿 c 轴方向的变化较大。这说明 In(2) 点的偶极分量随压力变化较小。通过分析超 fine 耦合，利用 4f 电子 content 在费米面附近的变化解释了 In(1) 点随压力变化的现象。研究表明，超 fine 耦合反映了材料电子结构在 Kondo 破坏量子临界点附近的变化。

Conclusion: 压力变化显著影响了沿 c 轴方向上的 In(1) Knight 偏移，但未显著影响沿平面方向的 Knight 偏移。这表明材料的电子结构可能在接近 Kondo 破坏量子临界点时发生显著变化。

Abstract: We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Knight shift measurements of the
In(1) and In(2) sites in CeRhIn$_5$ as a function of pressure. In contrast to
the $c$ axis, the in-plane components of the In(1) Knight shift tensor exhibit
little to no pressure dependence. These results indicate that the dipolar
component of the tensor is strongly suppressed at the In(1) site, while it
remains constant with pressure at the In(2) site. We analyze the hyperfine
coupling in terms of a tight binding model for the electronic structure, and
determine that the pressure dependence of the In(1) shift cannot be explained
in terms of changes to the crystal field parameters, but rather can be
understood in terms of an increase in the 4f electron content at the Fermi
surface. Our results indicate that the hyperfine coupling reflects changes in
the electronic structure near a Kondo breakdown quantum critical point.

Abstract: We investigated hole (Cd)- and electron (Sn)-doped CeCoIn$_5$
(CeCo(In$_{1-x}T_x$)$_5$ ($T$ = Cd or Sn)) using infrared spectroscopy.
Doping-dependent hybridization gap distribution functions were obtained from
the optical conductivity spectra based on the periodic Anderson model
formalism. The hybridization gap distribution exhibits two components: in-plane
and out-of-plane hybridization gaps. The doping-dependent evolution of the two
gaps indicated that the out-of-plane gap was more sensitive to doping.
Furthermore, the magnetic optical resistivity exhibited a doping-dependent
evolution of the $f$-electron amplitude. The two dopant types exhibited
different physical properties depending on the level of doping. The Sn dopant
increases the $f$-electron amplitude, whereas the Cd dopant does not affect the
$f$-electron amplitude. Doping-dependent effective mass is peaked at pure (or
undoped) CeCoIn$_5$. Our spectroscopic results may help understand the
doping-dependent electronic evolution of one of the canonical heavy fermion
systems, CeCoIn$_5$.

TL;DR: It is shown that DMFT and holography are closely related, with the scale dimensions for branch Green's functions and boundary correlation functions determined by DMFT solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between DMFT and holography is important for advancing theoretical approaches in strongly correlated electron systems.

Method: Analytic derivation of scale dimensions and BMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model.

Result: The scale dimensions give consistent information with DMFT for the Mott physics in the bulk.

Conclusion: Holographic renormalization group in DMFT explains the scale relationship between boundary and bulk systems in strongly correlated electron systems.

Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical
frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the
concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an
intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time
geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely
related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT,
particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a
holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the
outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its
fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's
function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter
space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's
function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge
of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's
function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard
model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition
in the deep interior.

Motivation: 魔层材料在强关联状态下表现出丰富的拓扑态，如互作用的整数和分数级Chern绝缘体。现有的互惠挑战Hartree-Fock平均场方法成功，但忽略了动量相关性，导致对称性自发性过度估计和对单粒子激发的定量描述失败。因此，需要一个一般的多体摄动框架来研究魔层系统。

Method: 本文提出了一种多体扰动框架，结合了所有带Hartree-Fock计算、随机相位近似（RPA）关联能量和GW准粒子校正。我们应用此框架到由菱形五层石墨烯和六元硼氮相互层组成的魔层超晶格。

Result: 所有带Hartree-Fock计算揭示了在-moer层填充-ν=1-时的相图，与实验测量定性吻合。引入RPA关联能量后，定量与电场中传输性质的演化相符。GW准粒子带具有显著减小的间隙和带宽，而准粒子权重接近于一，表明基态由单行列式充分描述。因此，该方法在该系统中验证了互惠方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该多体摄动框架为具有普遍适用性的超越互惠方法提供了系统的方法，可用于研究魔层系统。

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states,
including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common
approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the
Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical
correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry
breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle
excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework
for moir\'e systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random
phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle
corrections. We apply this framework to moir\'e superlattice consisted of
rhombohedral pentalayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Our
all-band Hartree-Fock calculations, which include all plane-wave components up
to the high-energy cutoff of the continuum model, reveal a phase diagram at
moir\'e filling $\nu=1$ that qualitatively aligns with experimental
measurements. Incorporating RPA correlation energy further yields quantitative
agreement with the evolution of transport properties across electric fields.
The $GW$ quasiparticle bands exhibit significantly reduced gaps and bandwidths
compared to Hartree-Fock results, while quasiparticle weights close to unity
indicate that the ground state is well-described by a Slater determinant,
justifying the qualitative effectiveness of mean-field approaches for integer
fillings in this system. Our versatile framework provides a systematic
beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moir\'e systems.

Motivation: Understanding and designing classical spin liquids for potential applications in quantum computing and material science.

Method: Drafting formalisms, cluster decoration rules, reciprocal space analysis, and testing with toy models.

Result: Recipe for tunable models with adjustable flat bands and spin liquid behavior, applicable in 2D and 3D.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework for designing versatile spin-liquids with engineerable features.

Abstract: Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local
constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with
distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in
\emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints
on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules
allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to
quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to
conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent
lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This
approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases
the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser
connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly
tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a
versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with
targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines.

Abstract: Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted
growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed
matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying
such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains
insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for
detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by
global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact
relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy
spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that
the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement
spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice
models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in
critical free-fermion systems.

Result: 研究发现，一种改进的 Anderson 模型中，itinerant电子间表现出有效的 onsite相互作用，其符号和大小由杂化能相对于费米能的位置决定。

Conclusion: 这种方法为理解高温超导的机理提供了新的可能性，尤其是它揭示了 two-particle 杂化与 onsite相互作用之间的直接联系。

Abstract: A modified Anderson lattice is proposed, whose the Hamiltonian accounts for
the two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons instead of
one-particle hybridization which takes into account in the original Anderson
model. The 1D version of this model can be solved using the Bethe ansazt. It
has been shown that hybridization between itinerant and frozen localized
electrons results in an effective on-site interaction between itinerant
electrons. The magnitude and sign of this interaction depend on the position of
the level relative to the Fermi energy (the energy of this level corresponds to
the two-particle state of localized electrons at a site). It is shown that when
the energy of an localized electron in the two-particle state lies above the
Fermi energy, the effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons is
attractive. A repulsive interaction between itinerant electrons occurs when
this energy lies below the Fermi energy. Thus, two-part hybridization between
localized and itinerant electrons can lead to effective attraction between
itinerant electrons, which is unique in itself and may underlie the nature of
high-temperature superconductivity.

Abstract: We report a random singlet ground state in the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg
pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$. Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder

power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\rm mag}/T$,
$^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and $\lambda_{\rm LF}$ demonstrate a disorder-driven

Abstract: We consider an electron interacting locally with two-level systems (TLSs) as
an archetypal model for charge transport in the presence of inelastic
scatterers. To assess the importance of quantum effects in the optical and d.c.
conductivity we solve the model numerically without approximations using the
finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), and compare the results with
Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). In the slow fluctuation limit, the coupling
to the TLSs causes transient localization of the carriers analogous to the one
recently found in the electron-boson scattering problem, featuring enhanced
resistivities and displaced Drude peaks. Fast inelastic scatterers suppress
localization, restoring a more conventional regime where transport and optical

*Ihor Sukhenko,Volodymyr Karbivskyy*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 文章研究了含铜 substitutions 的磷酸铅化合物的 DFT 筛选方法，并提出了三个设计规则：热力学稳定、Cu 原位偏好和近费米面结构的对称性强。通过 P/V/As 和 X、O/F/Cl/Br 的凸包分析，发现钒系列化合物是唯一符合要求的。Cu 在 Pb^I (4f) 上替换不会破坏能带，而 Pb^I (6h) 替换会显著影响能带。对称性降低的微小变化 $P3 → P1$ 可以打开能带隙，这促使引入了对称性强的条件筛选。筛选结果着重关注了 Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ 以及可能含有 Cl$_2$ 的化合物。文章建议了后续实验研究以及深入研究强相关性的计划.

Motivation: 材料科学中的取代反应性质研究一直是挑战，尤其是涉及过渡金属和稀有气体时。本研究提出了一个新的筛选方法，结合了热力学稳定性、Cu 偏好位置和对称性等因素，为选择合适的化合物提供了指导。

Conclusion: 通过结合 DFT 方法和三个设计原则，文章筛选出了含铜替换的磷酸铅化合物族中的主要候选者，为后续的实验研究和对强相关性的深入研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We develop a DFT screening procedure for copper-substituted lead apatites of
the composition Pb$_9$Cu(XO$_4$)$_6$Y that enforces three design rules:
thermodynamic stability, Cu site preference, and symmetry robustness of the
near-Fermi electronic structure. A convex-hull analysis over P/V/As as X,
O/F/Cl/Br as Y, identifies vanadates as the only members on or beneath the
hull. Across the family, Cu substitution at Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($4f$) preserves
flat bands at E$_F$, whereas Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($6h$) either gaps or severely
distorts them. Small symmetry-lowering relaxations ($P3 \rightarrow P1$) are
also capable of opening the band gap, motivating symmetry robustness as a
filter. Applying these criteria singles out Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ (and,
possibly, Cl$_2$) as leading candidates. This work motivates experimental study
of the selected compounds, as well as a dedicated study of strong correlations.

### [17] [Spin-polaron fingerprints in the optical conductivity of iridates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20337)
*Francesco Cassol,Léo Gaspard,Cyril Martins,Michele Casula,Benjamin Lenz*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel explanation for the double peak structure in optical transport measurements in iridate materials with a half-filled $j_{	ext{eff}}=1/2$ manifold, attributing it to spin-polarons instead of Hubbard subbands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the optical transport properties of iridate materials is crucial for advancing the field of strongly correlated electron systems. The double peak structure observed in these materials has been a topic of debate, and this paper aims to provide a new explanation.

Method: The authors employ dynamical mean-field theory and the self-consistent Born approximation to model the iridate materials Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. They use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical transport measurements as their primary tools to validate their theoretical findings.

Result: The theoretical models based on spin-polarons successfully reproduce the experimental observations, particularly the features of the first peak in the optical transport. The study also shows that the spin-polaron scenario is robust in the low-doped regime, applicable not only to these iridates but also to similar materials in antiferromagnetic cuprates.

Conclusion: This work challenges the conventional understanding of the double peak structure in iridate materials and provides a compelling explanation based on spin-polarons. The findings have broad implications for the study of strongly correlated electron systems and suggest that spin-polarons may be a universal feature in these materials.

Abstract: As a consequence of their spin-orbit entangled ground state, many $5d^{5}$
iridate materials display a peculiar double peak structure in optical transport
quantities, such as absorption and conductivity. Their common interpretation is
based on the presence of Hubbard subbands in the half-filled
$j_{\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$ manifold. Herein, we challenge this picture, proposing a
scenario based on the presence of spin-polaron (SP) quasiparticles, and
assigning a dominant SP character to the first peak. We illustrate it by taking
the materials Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ as paradigmatic examples, which
we investigate within the dynamical mean-field theory and the self-consistent
Born approximation. Both theories reproduce nontrivial features revealed by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical transport measurements,
supporting our interpretation. In the case of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, we show how the SP
scenario survives in the low-doped regime. Similar optical transport
fingerprints are expected to be found in the wider class of $5d^5$ iridates and
more generally in strongly correlated antiferromagnetic regimes, such as those
found in cuprates.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the Narlikar
gravity model with bulk viscous fluid by the new foam of creation field $C(t) =
t + \int \alpha (1 - a)dt + c_1$, based on the Hoyle-Narlikar's creation-field
theory, using a joint analysis of Observational Hubble Data (OHD) and the
Pantheon supernova (PP) compilation. Our analysis reveals that the creation
field coupling constant $(f)$ is always positive within the Narlikar gravity
model from OHD+PP data sets. The best-fit estimates yield $ H_0 = 71.2 \pm 2.1
\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\xi_0 = 0.23$, quoted at the $1 \sigma$
level. The Narlikar gravity model predicts a transition redshift of $z_t
\approx 0.63$ marking the onset of late-time cosmic acceleration, with the
corresponding age of the Universe estimated as $13.50\pm1.80 Gyr$.
Interestingly, the inferred higher value of $H_0$, relative to SH0ES
determinations, suggests a possible alleviation of the $\sim 4.1\sigma$ Hubble
tension. Furthermore, we assess the stability of the model and demonstrate that
the late-time acceleration can be consistently explained through the energy
conditions. This model retains dynamical flexibility while ensuring analytical
tractability and provides a promising framework to investigate the cosmological
implications of Hoyle-Narlikar gravity, particularly regarding late-time
acceleration and the evolution of dark energy.

Abstract: We investigate gravitationally induced interference within the framework of
teleparallel gravity, deriving a general expression for the gravitational phase
difference and applying it to an EMS spacetime. We then analyze how this phase
difference is affected by the presence or absence of black hole charge. Our
results show that, irrespective of charge, the dominant contribution to the
gravitational phase difference arises from the black hole mass. Nevertheless,
while the influence of charge is negligible under standard astrophysical
conditions, we identify a possible amplification mechanism through its
interplay with the coupling parameter $\alpha$ in the case of extremal charged
black holes. This finding not only offers new theoretical insights but also
suggests experimental opportunities for probing charged black hole parameters
via quantum interferometric techniques.

Motivation: 连续引力波的高计算成本使得传统的模板搜索在大规模参数空间中无法有效执行。因此，引入机器学习方法如注意力U-网（ATTNeT）来降低计算资源需求显得尤为必要。

Method: 研究采用了注意力U-网（ATTNeT）作为卷积神经网络（CNN）模型，通过在模拟数据上进行训练，其中包含高斯噪声，覆盖了从20Hz到1000Hz的所有频率范围。

Result: 实验结果表明，ATTNeT在20Hz的训练频率下具有最佳灵敏度，其90%检测效率的灵敏度深度为$D^{90	ext %} = 29.97 	ext ± 0.24	ext {Hz}^	ext {-1/2}$，每50mHz范围内只有1%的误报率，与20-1000Hz联合训练的ATTNeT相比，其灵敏度更高。

Abstract: Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high
computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces,
particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution
to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this
study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on
$\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches
at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz
achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity
depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm
rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields
$D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are
comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with
less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as
$T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained
at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network
demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence
on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the
trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that
attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous
gravitational wave searches.

Abstract: In this work, we present two generalized formulations of the Holographic and
Ricci dark energy (DE) models, given by $ \rho_{GH} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl} \left[
1-\epsilon\left(1-\frac{R}{H^2}\right) \right]H^2$ and $\rho_{GR} =
3c^2M^{2}_{pl}\left[ 1-\eta\left(1-\frac{H^2}{R}\right) \right]R$ where $H$ and
$R$ denote the Hubble parameter and the Ricci scalar, while $\epsilon$ and
$\eta$ are model parameters related by $\epsilon = 1 - \eta$. We derived
explicit analytical expressions for key cosmological quantities, including the
Hubble parameter, the DE density $\rho_D$, the DE pressure $p_D$, the equation
of state parameter of DE $\omega_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. The
analysis was carried out for four distinct cases: (i) the standard model in its
original formulation; (ii) the inclusion of spatial curvature; (iii) the
addition of interactions between the dark sectors; and (iv) the presence of
both interaction and curvature. Moreover, we also considered the limiting case
of a DE Dominated Universe.
  To further characterize the dynamical features of the models, we investigated
several diagnostic tools, namely the Statefinder parameters, the cosmographic
approach, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic and the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$ to
assess stability against perturbations. Moreover, we established a
correspondence between the DE models we studied and some scalar field theories,
including tachyon, k-essence, dilaton, quintessence, Dirac-Born-Infeld,
Yang-Mills and Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) fields.

Method: 研究采用了分析的方法，分析了附近地izon的条件，并使用Wald 不等式。通过数学推导和数值计算，导出了最大能量提取效率的闭式表达式。详细讨论了不同参数（如旋转、电荷、Born-Infeld参数）对能量提取效率的影响。

Result: 研究结果表明，随着电荷和非线性Born-Infeld参数增加，黑洞的horizon面积和ergoregion半径逐渐减小，能量提取效率通常低于Kerr和Kerr-Newman黑洞。然而，在某些特定参数区间， Born-Infeld几何可能导致更高的能效。此外，计算了不可约质量，发现非线性电动力学效应会减少horizon面积和相应的熵估计。

Conclusion: 总体而言，本研究在 Born-Infeld 电动力学框架下，成功地研究了能量提取效率与黑洞参数之间的关系。在特定条件下， Born-Infeld几何允许更高的能效。未来的工作可以进一步探索这些效应的极限情况，以及它们在实际天体中的潜在应用。

Abstract: We investigate the extraction of rotational energy from rotating
Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) black holes, where nonlinear electrodynamics
introduces a radius-dependent effective charge modifying the spacetime
geometry. Focusing on neutral test particles in the equatorial plane, we derive
analytic expressions for their kinematics and establish conditions for negative
energy orbits essential to the Penrose process using the near-horizon limit and
Wald inequality. We present a closed-form expression for maximal energy
extraction efficiency as a function of spin, charge, and the Born-Infeld
parameter $\beta$. Our numerical survey reveals that increasing charge and
nonlinear Born-Infeld effects generally reduce horizon radius and ergoregion
size, suppressing energy extraction efficiency compared to Kerr and often
Kerr-Newman black holes. However, at certain spins and \$beta$, the EBI
geometry can enhance efficiency beyond Kerr-Newman. We also compute the
irreducible mass, showing how nonlinear electromagnetic dynamics reduce the
horizon area and the associated entropy proxy. These results provide a unified
picture linking nonlinear electrodynamics, horizon structure, and energy
extraction efficiency across relevant parameters.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In principle, rapidly rotating black holes (BHs) with accretion disks --
either prograde or retrograde -- could naturally act as high-energy particle
colliders (HEPCs) because particles falling in from infinity that collide with
particles in the disk near the BH horizon can exhibit center-of-mass (CM)
energies beyond the capabilities of terrestrial instruments. However, we show
that scattering can moderate the CM energy of near-horizon collisions. We find
that rapidly rotating BHs with prograde accretion disks are the most viable
candidates for astrophysical HEPCs, whereas BHs with retrograde disks are
disfavored, when scattering is incorporated.

Conclusion: 该方法在计算黑洞回转粒子的自我力方面具有优势，但未来仍需解决计算复杂性和适用范围的扩展问题。

Abstract: We investigate the use of the Gegenbauer procedure for time-domain
reconstruction in frequency-domain calculations of the self-force on a particle
orbiting a black hole. The conventional technique relies on the so-called
method of extended homogeneous solutions (EHS), which circumvents the Gibbs
phenomenon that would otherwise hamper the reconstruction of the particle's
field from frequency modes. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of EHS
reconstruction deteriorates rapidly with increasing orbital eccentricity, due
to large numerical cancellations between frequency-mode contributions.
Furthermore, the method is only suitable for bound orbits and cannot be fully
applied in scattering scenarios. The Gegenbauer reconstruction procedure
involves a re-projection of the partial Fourier representation onto a
complementary basis of polynomials. The resulting series converges
exponentially while averting the cancellation problem. We demonstrate the
procedure with numerical results for the spherical harmonic modes of the scalar
field sourced by a scalar charge in orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We
illustrate the merits of this approach, and discuss the challenges that remain
for a full Gegenbauer-based self-force calculation.

Abstract: We uncover a new class of phenomena in gravitational physics, whereby
resonances in the complex plane can be excited via tailored time-dependent
scattering. We show that specific forms of temporal modulation of an incoming
signal can lead to complete absorption for the entire duration of the
scattering process. This, then, makes stars and black holes truly black. Such
``virtual absorption'' stores energy with high efficiency, releasing it once
the process finishes via relaxation into the characteristic virtual absorption
modes -- also known as total transmission modes -- of the object. While such
modes are challenging to obtain and four-dimensional black holes have a
restricted set of solutions, we also show that higher dimensional black holes
have a complex and interesting structure of virtual absorption modes.

Abstract: As part of our program to develop a general theory of relativity for open
systems, we introduce a covariant theory that incorporates the effects of
classical and quantum spacetime alterations in a new metric tensor that
effectively includes these alterations, thereby generating a Riemannian
manifold from a new varied action without boundary terms. We illustrate the
theory by studying an inflationary model which incorporates the quantum
feedback effects of spacetime on the dynamics of the inflaton field
$\hat{\varphi}$, enabling the simultaneous quantization of $\hat{\varphi}$ and
the fluctuating gravitational field $\hat{\Omega}$ without relying on
perturbative theory. We obtain an exact solution for the modes of both fields,
$\hat{\varphi}$ and $\hat{\Omega}$, which comply with different quantum
algebras. The normalization of the inflaton field modes that is obtained is
intrinsically related to the geometric field modes, in such a way that the
quantization of the fields results from an expression that links the geometric
fields with the physical fields. Finally, the quadratic fluctuations of
spacetime are calculated, and its spectrum is analyzed.

Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of standard and generalized Rastall gravity
inflationary models, using the scalar spectral index and the Rastall parameter
expressed as functions of the number of $e-$folds $N$. Within a general
formalism, we derive the effective potential in terms of the relevant
cosmological parameters and the Rastall parameter for these gravity frameworks.
As a specific example, we analyze the attractor $n_s(N) - 1 \propto N^{-1}$,
first by considering constant values of the Rastall parameter to reconstruct
the inflationary stage in standard Rastall gravity, and then by assuming a
linear dependence on the number of $e-$folds $N$ to reconstruct the
inflationary model in generalized Rastall gravity. Thus, the reconstruction of
the potential $V(\phi)$ is obtained for both standard and generalized Rastall
gravity inflationary models. In both frameworks, we constrain key parameters of
the reconstructed models during inflation using the latest observational data
from Planck.

Abstract: Supernova explosions are expected as one of the promising candidates for
gravitational wave sources. In this study, we examine the supernova
gravitational waves, focusing on the multidimensional treatment of gravity in
the simulation. For this purpose, we newly performed two-dimensional
relativistic simulations with a nonmonopole (two-dimensional) potential and
compared the resultant gravitational wave signals in the simulations with the
frequencies of the proto-neutron stars with and without the Cowling
approximation. Then, we find that the proto-neutron star frequencies with the
Cowling approximation overestimate the gravitational wave frequencies. On the
other hand, the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations with metric
perturbations agree well with the gravitational wave signals in the
simulations. Employing the new data, we derive a new fitting formula for the
supernova gravitational wave frequencies with the two-dimensional gravitational
potential, independently of the progenitor mass. Combining this new formula
with the previous one derived from the Cowling approximation, we also derive
the formula to predict the gravitational wave frequencies with a
two-dimensional potential, using those with a monopole potential.

Abstract: This paper investigates the gravastar model as a potential alternative to
black holes, utilizing the Kuchowicz metric in the context of Rastall gravity.
The model comprises three distinct regions: an interior with positive energy
density and negative pressure, a thin intermediate shell made of
ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, and an exterior vacuum. The negative pressure
within the interior generates an outward force exerted on the shell, fulfilling
the Zel'dovich criterion. This configuration eliminates the central singularity
and replaces the event horizon with the shell. We then derive the radial metric
functions for both the inner and thin region, yielding a non-singular solution.
Furthermore, we examine the physical properties of the shell, such as its
energy, proper length, entropy, equation of state parameter, gravitational
redshift and adiabatic index, across a range of Rastall parameter values. We
conclude that the resulting gravastar model offers a promising solution to the
singularity problem of conventional black holes within the context of this
non-conservative theory.

Abstract: General relativity describes the dynamics of gravitational waves, which can
feature nonlinear interactions, such as those underlying turbulent processes.
Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of
gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical
description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such
a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a
set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general
relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation
underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear
interactions described by this equation are in part Alfv\'enic, linking
gravitational wave turbulence to Alfv\'enic turbulence. Our work paves the way
for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through
insights from magnetohydrodynamics.

Abstract: We investigate a novel gravitational configuration formed by a massless real
phantom field and an axion scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity. This
system describes an Ellis-type wormhole situated at the center of an axion
star. By normalizing the mass of the axion field to unity, the physical
properties of the model are determined by three independent parameters: the
potential's decay constant, the frequency of the axion field, and the
wormhole's throat parameter. We assess the traversability of this wormhole by
examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution.
Our analysis of the wormhole's embedding diagrams indicates that, although the
wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat
configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific
conditions. Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of
at least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat.

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive cosmographic analysis of Friedmann cosmologies
modified by non-extensive entropy frameworks, focusing on Tsallis, R\'enyi, and
Kaniadakis entropies within a novel modified energy-momentum tensor approach.
In our approach the microscopic matter density remains $\rho=m~n$ while the
horizon thermodynamics of non-extensive entropy modifies the effective source
that drives expansion, $\rho_{eff}=f(\rho)\rho$ which reduces to the standard
case for $f(\rho)=1$. By deriving the generalized Friedmann equations for each
entropy type, we calculate analytical expressions for key cosmographic
parameters, including the deceleration ($q_0$), jerk ($j_0$), snap ($s_0$), and
lerk ($l_0$) parameters, and examine their behavior compared to the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model. Our results reveal significant differences between the
traditional formal approach and the modified energy-momentum approach,
particularly in the Tsallis model where cosmographic parameters and the
dimensionless Hubble function $E(z)$ show notable deviations for deformation
parameters away from unity. Moreover, both R\'enyi and Kaniadakis models
exhibit increasing tension with $\Lambda$CDM at higher redshifts, while
remaining similar at low redshifts. Importantly, given the persistent
$\sim5\sigma$ Hubble tension between local and global measurements, our
analysis indicates that the flexibility of the modified entropic cosmology
framework to alter the expansion rate could potentially alleviate this
discrepancy by modifying the effective expansion history in a way compatible
with observations. Future work will involve full Bayesian analyses with
Pantheon+, DESI, and Planck data to further assess the viability of these
models in resolving current cosmological tensions.

Method: 通过研究 EMRI 和 Galactic 白矮双星系统之间复杂的引力波信号干扰，采用贝叶斯推断方法来提高参数估计的准确性。通过去除能观测的 Galactic 白矮双星信号来减少干扰。

Result: 结果显示， Galactic 白矮双星系统的强信号会显著干扰 EMRI 的探测，甚至可能是主要的干扰源。尽管去除部分干扰信号后，EMRI 参数的贝叶斯推断达到了高精度，与理想情况下的高斯噪声环境相当。

Conclusion: Pathfinders, 进一步研究 Galactic 双星系统如何干扰 EMRI, 并开发新的信号处理技术以提高 LISA 的探测能力。

Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatory, the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna, is expected to observe between a few and a few
thousand extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) per year. Due to the simultaneous
presence of other gravitational wave signals in the data, it can be challenging
to detect EMRIs and accurately estimate their parameters. In this work, we
investigate the interaction between a gravitational signal from an EMRI and
millions of signals from inspiralling Galactic white dwarf binaries. We
demonstrate that bright Galactic binaries contaminate the detection and
characterization of EMRIs. We perform Bayesian inference of EMRI parameters
after removing resolvable Galactic binaries and confirm an accuracy comparable
to that expected in Gaussian noise.

TL;DR: This paper investigates static spherically symmetric solutions in the framework of nonlocal gravity, a modified form of general relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore modified gravitational theories and their solutions, particularly focusing on static spherically symmetric configurations.

Method: The method involves introducing a scalar gravitational susceptibility function S(x) and modifying the source-free gravitational field equations from Einstein's general relativity (GR).

Result: The Schwarzschild spacetime is shown to be an exact solution of the modified equations when S is constant. The mass is found to be M/(1+S), where M is the GR limit mass. The interpretation as a black hole is ruled out due to the divergence of algebraic invariants of the Weitzenböck torsion at the Schwarzschild horizon.

Conclusion: Nonlocal gravity allows for exact Schwarzschild solutions with modified mass, but the physical interpretation as a black hole becomes invalid in this framework.

Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric solutions within the framework of
the local limit of nonlocal gravity. This theory departs from Einstein's
general relativity (GR) through the introduction of a scalar gravitational
susceptibility function $S(x)$, $1+S > 0$, which is a new feature of the
spacetime that vanishes in the GR limit. It is shown that the Schwarzschild
spacetime constitutes an exact solution of the modified source-free
gravitational field equations provided $S$ is a constant. The mass of the
corresponding Schwarzschild solution is given by $M/(1+S)$, where $M$ denotes
the mass of the solution in the GR limit. The interpretation of the solution in
terms of a black hole is ruled out due to the divergence of the algebraic
invariants of the Weitzenb\"ock torsion at the Schwarzschild horizon.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved algorithm for suppressing tilt-to-length (TTL) noise in the Taiji gravitational wave detector, addressing noise floor and gravitational wave signal considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TDF noise suppression is crucial for enhancing gravitational wave detection sensitivity, particularly in the challenging environment of space-based instruments.

Method: The algorithm improves upon existing methods by incorporating an adaptive noise floor estimation and gravitational wave signal modeling during the suppression process, utilizing a spacecraft dynamics simulation that includes drag-free and attitude control systems.

Result: Numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness, and its robustness across various payload statuses is demonstrated.

Conclusion: The algorithm offers a significant advancement toward achieving Taiji's full sensitivity by addressing key noise sources and optimizing noise suppression in the presence of gravitational waves.

Abstract: The Taiji mission for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection employs
laser interferometry to measure picometer-scale distance variations induced by
GWs. The tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise in the inter-spacecraft
interferometers, which originates from the angular jitters of the spacecrafts
and the movable optical subassemblies, is predicted to be one of the main noise
sources that might reduce Taiji's sensitivity to GWs. Since these angular
jitters can be read out through the differential wavefront sensors, it is
possible to suppress TTL noise during the data processing stage by fitting and
subtracting it. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for TTL noise
suppression, which addresses the issue of unknown noise floor required for
optimal estimation in the practical detection scenario, and the design of this
algorithm takes into account the presence of GW signals. The algorithm is
validated via numerical simulation, which is built on a spacecraft dynamics
simulation incorporating Taiji's drag-free and attitude control system. We also
demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm by varying TTL coefficients at
different levels, indicating that our algorithm is applicable to a range of
payload statuses, and ultimately providing a critical advancement toward
realizing Taiji's full sensitivity.

### [37] [Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20344)
*Hanna Liis Tamm,Nicolas Aimar,João Luís Rosa*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper studies models of ultra-compact objects that mimic black holes using polarization observations. Two models, relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars, are examined with the GYOTO software. Key observables like Stokes parameters I, Q, U and EVPA are extracted. The models show qualitative similarity to black holes, with slight differences that can constrain spacetime metrics and probe fundamental properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the motivation to understand the spacetime of exotic compact objects by analyzing polarization signatures. This approach offers a powerful method to infer properties that are otherwise challenging to observe directly.

Method: The study uses numerical simulations via GYOTO to model the orbits of hot spots in relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. Observables such as polarization patterns in the QU-plane and EVPA are extracted and compared.

Result: The relativistic fluid sphere model, featuring a pressure singularity, closely resembles a black hole. In contrast, the gravastar model shows notably different EVPA curves, especially at lower inclinations. The differences become more pronounced at higher inclinations, suggesting potential restrictions on some ECO models based on future high-inclination observations.

Conclusion: The research enhances our understanding of spacetime metrics around exotic compact objects by leveraging polarization semantics, particularly through the comparison of fluid spheres and gravastars.

Abstract: Recent observations of polarimetric parameters of active galactic nuclei
motivate the study of polarization in the spacetime of exotic compact objects
which can mimic the features of black holes in the strong field regime of
gravity. In this work, we study the properties of two models for ultra-compact
objects containing light rings - relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. We
have simulated the orbit of a hot spot around the considered objects in the
polarization ray-tracing software GYOTO, and extracted observables, namely
integrated images of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U; their evolution during the
orbit in the QU-plane, and the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Our
models resemble the black hole qualitatively, with slight additional imprints
which provide a useful tool to constrain the spacetime metric of supermassive
compact objects with current and future observations, and probe the fundamental
properties of these objects. We have found that one fluid star model with a
pressure singularity resembles the black hole entirely, while another gravastar
features notable differences in the EVPA curve in the low-inclination case.
Since differences between the models become more pronounced for a higher
inclination, our results could potentially restrict the adequateness of ECO
classes with future high-inclination observations.

Abstract: A broadband, thermally stable absorber is essential for thermophotovoltaic
(TPV) systems to simultaneously convert solar and industrial waste heat into
usable energy to meet growing power demands. Here, we proposed an ingenious
polarization-independent truncated pyramid-shaped symmetric multilayer
metamaterial absorber in a metal-insulator-metal-insulator (MIMI) architecture
with almost complete absorption over a broad wavelength range. A total of six
structures (W/AlN, Mo/AlN, Ta/AlN, Rh/MgO, Rh/SiO2, Re/BN) were designed, and
the materials were selected based on their lattice matching to prevent
delamination at interfaces between layers. The absorption mechanism was studied
at room temperature using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and
the structure was optimized through a brute force design approach, which
illustrates a best average absorption of 98.2% till 4000 nm and 97.73% till
5072 nm wavelength for the W/AlN structure with metal and dielectric
thicknesses of 60 nm and 17.5 nm, respectively. Moreover, W/AlN structure
exhibits over 96% average absorption up to 50 degree incident angles
irrespective of polarizations. The thermal stability was evaluated using the
finite element method (FEM) by determining von Mises stress at elevated
temperatures. Thermal analysis revealed that only W/AlN can withstand around
1700 K temperature and 1500 times the incident power before permanent
deformation. A temperature-dependent Drude-Lorentz model was used to further
analyze the effect of absorption on the optical performance of the highly
absorptive and thermally stable W/AlN structure. Additionally, we determined
the effect of the concentration factor, and the operating temperature on the
system efficiency by considering the emission loss of the heated absorber.

Abstract: Light-emitting metasurfaces provide a compact, integrated solution for
simultaneous light generation and beam shaping, making them a promising
candidate for advanced photonic applications. However, existing approaches for
tailoring far-field emission patterns primarily operate in the spontaneous
emission regime, where low coherence limits precise light control. Here, we
present a light-emitting metasurface system with holographic lasing output,
composed of a binary-structured metasurface integrated with a gain medium, that
enables coherent light generation and precise beam shaping of the output lasing
emission. With a compact footprint, low lasing threshold, and wide field of
view, our system offers an exceptional platform for generating
arbitrarily-structured lasing light, with significant potential for
miniaturized optical systems.

TL;DR: Author proposes a method to generate a skyrmion needle that maintains its topology under high-NA conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently a lack of methods to transport skyrmions without their topological properties being altered under high-NA conditions.

Method: The authors propose using a single plasmonic metalens that functions as both a polarization filter and a super-resolving focusing element.

Result: Experiments and simulations demonstrated that the proposed skyrmion needle exhibits non-diffractive propagation over a depth of 5 lambda while maintaining the Stokes-vector texture at subdiffraction scales.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing methods for skyrmion transport and opens new possibilities for applications in informatics, light-matter interaction, and optical metrology.

Abstract: Optical Stokes skyrmions have garnered extensive interest due to their
intrinsic topological robustness and potential in informatics.However, most
research remains confined to paraxial, low-numerical-aperture (low-NA) regimes,
where their large transverse dimensions restrict broader applications.Under
high-NA focusing, the polarization texture typically degrades or transforms
abruptly as the beam traverses the focal region, hindering topology-preserving
transport.In this work, we propose a strategy to generate a skyrmion needle
field that maintains both subdiffraction confinement and non-diffractive
propagation under high-NA conditions, thus preserving their topological
characteristsics. Leveraging the polarization invariance of conventional
optical needles, we realize the Stokes skyrmion needle using a single plasmonic
metalens,designed to function as both a polarization filter and a
super-resolving focusing element.Experimental and simulation results verify
non-diffractive propagation over an extended depth of focus (up to 5 lambda),
while the Stokes-vector texture retained at subdiffraction scales throughout
propagation. This skyrmion needle not only addresses previous propagation
constraints but also opens new avenues for diffraction-unlimited information
transport. Such skyrmion needles exhibit substantial potential in fields
including light-matter interaction, optical metrology, and informatics.

Abstract: Directly switching optical signals outperforms conventional optoelectronic
hardware in terms of cost, latency, and energy efficiency, and is expected to
address the growing demand for data node capacity driven by the development of
machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Therefore,
optical circuit switching (OCS) technology has piqued widespread research
interest in various technical solutions, including silicon photonics. However,
silicon-based integrated OCS remains constrained by challenges such as network
performance and port scalability. Here we propose a magneto-optical
heterogeneous integrated nonreciprocal OCS (NOCS) network based on a silicon
photonics platform, achieving bidirectional full-duplex nonreciprocal
transmission by programming reciprocal and nonreciprocal phase shifters. We
demonstrate that compared with the existing OCS architecture, NOCS has the
advantages of ultra-high reconfiguration speed, large-scale integration
compatibility, and bidirectional channel isolation reducing the number of
required ports. NOCS could meet the programming speed requirements of the AI
backend network, or supports nonreciprocal optical switching applications

Conclusion: 多晶圆结构通过激发和抑制不同波段的SHG，实现高效、高转换效率的对称SHG产生。

Abstract: As one of the two types of backward second-harmonic generation (SHG),
symmetric SHG exhibits some physical characteristics and application prospects
that are distinct from those of forward SHG. It is generally realized through
quasi-phase matching, which imposes more stringent requirements on the poling
period and thus presents challenges for domain engineering. Although employing
larger poling periods can ease fabrication, it inevitably reduces conversion
efficiency, a drawback that can be compensated by using a cavity. In this work,
we employed a semi-monolithic cavity to enhance the efficiency of 7th-order
symmetric SHG, achieving a measured one-sided conversion efficiency of 7.2 %,
which corresponds to a theoretical total efficiency of 14.4 %. This represents
an improvement of more than three orders of magnitude compared with the
single-pass case. In addition, the nonlinear coefficient of the crystal of
${d_{33}} = 4.8$ $\rm pm/V$ was estimated.

Abstract: Optical frequency combs paved the way for fast and compact multi-component

implement a scheme for a rapid, compact spectroscopic analyser that operates
without moving components, leveraging the tunability and speed of a single
quantum walk comb laser. Previously, these combs have been shown to deliver
stable, tunable and broadband lasing. Here, a single quantum cascade
laser-based comb emitting within the significant molecular fingerprint region
of the mid-infrared spectrum was employed in a non-interferometric setup for
targeted and non-targeted analysis of various organic solvent vapours. With a
time resolution as small as 10 microseconds and a high dynamic range reaching
three orders of magnitude in concentration, this approach is suitable for the
real-time analysis of chemical kinetics.

Abstract: Molecular chirality plays an important role in chemistry and biology, allows
control of biological interactions, affects drugs efficacy and safety, and
promotes synthesis of new materials. In general, chirality manifests itself in
optical activity (circular dichroism or circular birefringence). Chiral
plasmonic nanoparticles have been recently developed for molecular enantiomer
separation, chiral sensing and chiral photocatalysis. Here, we show that
optical chirality of plasmonic nanoparticles exhibiting strong scattering can
remain completely undetected using standard characterisation techniques, such
as circular dichroism measurements. This phenomenon, which we term meso-chiral
in analogy to meso-compounds in chemistry, is based on mutual cancellation of
absorption and scattering chiral responses. As a prominent example, the
meso-optical behaviour has been numerically demonstrated in multi-wound-SiO2/Au
nanoparticles over the entire visible spectral range and in other prototypical
chiral nanoparticles in narrower spectral ranges. The meso-chiral property has
been experimentally verified by demonstrating chiral absorption of gold
helicoid nanoparticles at the wavelength where conventional circular dichroism
measurements show absence of chiral response (gext=0). These findings
demonstrate a valuable link between microscopic to macroscopic manifestations
of chirality and can provide insights for interpreting a wide range of
experimental results and designing chiral properties of plasmonic
nanoparticles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) have been suggested for ultra-sensitive sensing
because the eigenfrequency splitting grows as the nth-root of a perturbation,
suggesting divergent responsivity. In ideal linear devices, however, this
responsivity gain is reconciled by a matching divergence in the quantum
shot-noise floor, so the net signal-to-noise ratio remains unchanged. Recent
work has extended this argument to nonlinear devices, such as above-threshold
lasers, predicting other divergences at an EP that is shifted by the interplay
of noise and saturation effects. Here we analyze a system of two coupled
saturable resonators and show analytically that a self-consistent treatment of
fluctuation dynamics removes these divergences entirely. Islands of instability
arise in the parameter space surrounding the EP due to the coupling of phase
noise into the amplitude dynamics, dictating a maximum responsivity and maximum
noise that can be experimentally observed. Stochastic Langevin simulations of
the full nonlinear system corroborate our analytical results down to zero
detuning.

TL;DR: Refgen is a machine learning pipeline for discovering new refrigerants by integrating physics-based models with molecular generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scarcity of validated alternatives to hydrofluorocarbons in refrigeration systems by leveraging generative AI and physics models.

Method: Refgen uses generative models combined with physics-based predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemistry, and vapor compression simulations to guide the discovery of new refrigerants.

Result: The result is a novel approach that effectively uses limited data to discover new refrigerants with better efficiency, safety, and environmental impact than existing methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Refgen successfully combines physics-based knowledge with machine learning to advance the discovery of environmentally friendly refrigerants.

Abstract: Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as
hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down.
Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for
alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a
few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation.
This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven
methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine
learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for
valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical
properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor
compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning
fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding
discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental
impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce
data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set
of compounds.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers the promise of revolutionizing quantum chemistry by
enabling the solution of chemical problems for substantially less computational
cost. While most demonstrations of quantum computation to date have focused on
resolving the energies of the electronic ground states of small molecules, the
field of quantum chemistry is far broader than ground state chemistry; equally
important to practicing chemists are chemical reaction dynamics and reaction
mechanism prediction. Here, we review progress toward and the potential of
quantum computation for understanding quantum chemistry beyond the ground
state, including for reaction mechanisms, reaction dynamics, and finite
temperature quantum chemistry. We discuss algorithmic and other considerations
these applications share, as well as differences that make them unique. We also
highlight the potential speedups these applications may realize and challenges
they may face. We hope that this discussion stimulates further research into
how quantum computation may better inform experimental chemistry in the future.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The study introduces a new method to improve the efficiency of the Generative Quantum Eigensolver (GQE) by leveraging deep learning to transfer knowledge between molecular systems, using an example of the UCCSD ansatz in quantum chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original VQE algorithm has limitations, prompting the integration of deep generative models to enhance its capabilities. The motivation is to address these limitations and improve the efficiency of quantum-classical hybrid frameworks.

Method: The method involves using the SMILES representation and text-based approach to model UCCSD quantum operators, employing text pattern similarities and text similarity metrics to establish a transfer learning framework for knowledge transfer between molecular systems.

Result: The baseline approach demonstrates the success of knowledge transfer for ground-state energy calculations in the GQE paradigm, significantly reducing computational resource requirements.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in enhancing the efficiency of quantum-classical computations for molecular systems by leveraging deep learning and transfer learning techniques.

Abstract: Given the inherent limitations of traditional Variational Quantum
Eigensolver(VQE) algorithms, the integration of deep generative models into
hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, specifically the Generative Quantum
Eigensolver(GQE), represents a promising innovative approach. However, taking
the Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles(UCCSD) ansatz which is
widely used in quantum chemistry as an example, different molecular systems
require constructions of distinct quantum operators. Considering the similarity
of different molecules, the construction of quantum operators utilizing the
similarity can reduce the computational cost significantly. Inspired by the
SMILES representation method in computational chemistry, we developed a
text-based representation approach for UCCSD quantum operators by leveraging
the inherent representational similarities between different molecular systems.
This framework explores text pattern similarities in quantum operators and
employs text similarity metrics to establish a transfer learning framework. Our
approach with a naive baseline setting demonstrates knowledge transfer between
different molecular systems for ground-state energy calculations within the GQE
paradigm. This discovery offers significant benefits for hybrid
quantum-classical computation of molecular ground-state energies, substantially
reducing computational resource requirements.

Motivation: 深入理解水的热力学性质对于生命科学和气候研究至关重要，传统理论方法面临挑战，需借助计算模拟。然而，路径积分分子动力学模拟受计算资源限制，通过降低模拟成本的机器学习势能方法可能出现突破。

Method: 研究者开发了高维神经网络势能（HDNNP），并结合路径积分分子动力学算法，在Can umbrella采样框架下进行模拟。为进一步加速计算，设计了并行算法以同时计算能量、力和坐标的演化及热阻性时间演化。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解水和水溶液的热力学性质提供了强有力的计算工具。

Abstract: Water is a unique solvent with many remarkable properties. An example is its
exceptionally high heat capacity, which plays an important role in storing and
transporting thermal energy, with implications for many processes from
regulating the body temperature of living organisms to moderating our climate
at the global scale. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the heat capacity
of water from first principles, highly accurate computer simulations are
required. Apart from a reliable description of the atomic interactions, the
presence of light hydrogen atoms necessitates the explicit consideration of
nuclear quantum effects through path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD)
simulations. The high computational costs of PIMD simulations, which are even
further increased by the need for an extensive statistical sampling of energy
fluctuations to determine the heat capacity, can be strongly reduced by
replacing first principles calculations with machine learning potentials to
represent the atomic interactions. In this study, we use high-dimensional
neural network potentials (HDNNPs) constructed from density functional theory
calculations employing the RPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 functionals. To further
enhance the computational performance, we introduce a highly efficient PIMD
algorithm computing in parallel not only the energies and forces but also the
coordinate and thermostat time evolutions. Using this approach, we are able to
determine converged data for the heat capacity from a 4 ns simulation employing
128 beads. In particular, for the revPBE0-D3 functional we find excellent
agreement with experiment, providing evidence that our approach represents a
promising framework for the quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic
properties of water and aqueous solutions.

TL;DR: 改变纳米级孔隙表面离子电荷会影响其中被水分子所束缚的分子运动特性，这将影响其在几何、物理化学和生物过程中的作用。通过使用两种结构相似的有机bsite (PMOs)，分别为无电和带电的基团单元，观察了两者对液态水分子运动特性的影响。结果发现，带电的PMO显著减缓了水分子的动态，缩短了扩散因子并增加住了在孔隙中的停留时间。在改变孔隙填充率后，这种影响扩展到孔隙内部的整个体积。这对于玻璃转变、流动泵和薄膜设计等应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Interfacial interactions significantly alter the fundamental properties of
water confined in mesoporous structures, with crucial implications for
geological, physicochemical, and biological processes. Herein, we focused on
the effect of changing the surface ionic charge of nanopores with comparable
pore size (3.5-3.8 nm) on the dynamics of confined liquid water. The control of
the pore surface ionicity was achieved by using two periodic mesoporous
organosilicas (PMOs) containing either neutral or charged forms of a chemically
similar bridging unit. The effect on the dynamics of water at the nanoscale was
investigated in the temperature range of 245 -300 K, encompassing the glass
transition by incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS), For both types
of PMOs, the water dynamics revealed two distinct types of molecular motions:
rapid local movements and translational jump diffusion. While the neutral PMO
induces a moderate confinement effect, we show that the charged PMO drastically
slows down water dynamics, reducing translational diffusion by a factor of four
and increasing residence time by an order of magnitude. Notably, by changing
the pore filling values, we demonstrate that for charged pore this effect
extends beyond the interfacial layer of surface-bound water molecules to
encompass the entire pore volume. Thus, our observation indicates a dramatic
change in the long-range character of the interaction of water confined in
nanopores with surface ionic charge compared to a simple change in
hydrophilicity. This is relevant for the understanding of a broad variety of
applications in (nano)technological phenomena and processes, such as
nanofiltration and membrane design.

Abstract: Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) based on absolutely localized molecular

we develop a neural network EDA model capable of predicting the electron
delocalization energy component of water molecules, which captures the
stabilization arising from charge transfer between occupied absolutely
localized molecular orbitals of one molecule and the virtual orbitals of
another. Exploiting the locality assumption of the electronic structure, our
model enables accurate prediction of electron delocalization energies for
molecular systems far beyond the size accessible to conventional density

the applicability of our approach by modeling hydration effects in large

Abstract: We consider the problem of bounding the effective nonreciprocal properties of
metamaterials. Recently, significant progress was made by showing that this
problem can be reduced to bounding an equivalent reciprocal one and applying a
monotonicity argument. Here, we build upon this result and provide bounds
incorporating additional information about the metamaterial. Specifically, in
the two-phase case, we provide bounds for isotropic metamaterials. In the
multiphase case, we provide bounds for uniaxial metamaterials that additionally
incorporate the volume fractions. In both instances, the incorporated
additional information significantly tightens the bounds. In the two-phase
case, we evaluate the bounds by comparing them to the effective properties of
hierarchical laminate microstructures. This comparison ultimately leads us to
propose a set of conjectured bounds. While our discussion focuses on the Hall
effect, our results are more broadly applicable to other nonreciprocal effects
in so far as their mathematical description is equivalent. In particular, our
bounds apply to the Faraday effect in the quasistatic regime and in the absence
of losses and resonances.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The climate impact of building envelopes is often quantified using their
energy savings and CO2 emission reduction benefits. However, building envelopes
also trap solar and thermal infrared heat, which is dissipated as a direct
heating penalty into our warming planet. For static or adaptive envelopes that
passively heat buildings by radiatively retaining heat, these two effects are
antagonistic. Yet, their net effect remains unexplored. In this study, we
compare the emission reductions benefit, and direct heating penalty of two
classes of roof envelopes, traditional and adaptive radiative coolers (TRCs and
ARCs). Calculations for buildings in different urban climates show that
relative to TRCs like cool roofs, ARCs like smart roofs may have a net heating
impact on earth well past this century. Thus, despite their relative energy
savings and CO2 emissions reductions benefits, adaptive envelopes on roofs have
a negative climate impact relative to traditional cooling designs. Our findings
are generalizable across climates and a range of building envelopes and call
for a rethinking of how sustainability is quantified for building envelopes,
and of material and architectural design for buildings.

Motivation: The paper motivates the development of advanced gate dielectrics for nanosheet transistors, recognizing the limitations in current evaluation methods and calling for systematic criteria.

Method: The paper proposes a general framework for evaluating gate dielectrics in nanosheet transistors without detailing specific methods or experiments.

Result: While the paper formulates criteria for suitable gate dielectrics, no experimental results are presented.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that these proposed criteria could enhance the effectiveness of gate dielectrics but leaves detailed implementation and testing to future research.

Abstract: The recent progress in nanosheet transistors has established two-dimensional
(2D) semiconductors as viable candidates for future ultra-scaled electronic
devices. Next to reducing contact resistance, identifying good gate dielectrics
is a fundamental challenge, as the dielectric/channel interface dramatically
impacts virtually all performance parameters. While several promising gate
dielectrics have recently been reported, the evaluation of their quality and
suitability is often fragmentary and focused on selected important performance
metrics of the gate stack, such as the capacitive gate control, leakage
currents, reliability, and ease of fabrication and integration. However,
identifying a suitable gate stack is a complex problem that has not yet been
approached systematically. In this perspective, we aim to formulate general
criteria for good gate dielectrics.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the radiation tolerance of photonic integrated circuits, focusing on Mach-Zehnder modulators. They found that 10-keV X-ray irradiation significantly degraded the performance of silicon photonic MZMs, with reduced bandwidth, eye closure, and increased error rates. The degradation was attributed to total ionizing dose effects causing hole trapping at silicon/silicon dioxide interfaces and fast traps near the conduction band edge. Interestingly, when all leads were grounded, no radiation sensitivity was observed, emphasizing the importance of testing under standard conditions for ground-based radiation testing and on-orbit studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiation tolerance is essential for deploying photonic integrated circuits in radiation-prone environments like space, high-energy particle accelerators, and defense facilities. Ensuring performance and compactness in such environments is increasingly important as demand for high-capacity information processing and transport grows.

Method: The study used photonic MZMs as exemplars and tested their electro-optic performance under 10-keV X-ray irradiation. They measured the influence of ionization effects on bandwidth, eye closure, and error rates. Additionally, they conducted experiments with MZMs having all leads grounded to observe the effect of testing conditions.

Result: The irradiation caused significant performance degradation in silicon photonic MZMs, primarily due to total ionizing dose effects. Hole trapping at waveguide interfaces and fast traps near the conduction band edge were key factors. Moreover, they observed no degradation when the leads were grounded, suggesting that standard operating conditions are crucial for testing in ground-based and space environments.

Conclusion: This research highlights the need for comprehensive radiation tolerance assessment of photonic integrated circuits like MZMs. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of radiation-induced degradation and underscore the importance of testing under standard conditions for reliable deployment in radiation-prone environments.

Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits have become essential for meeting the growing
global demand for high-capacity information processing and transport. Assessing
their radiation tolerance is essential for deploying systems in radiation prone
environments - including in space, high-energy particle accelerators, and
defense radiation testing facilities - where the performance and compactness of
photonic integrated circuits are increasingly advantageous. This work
investigates the analog and digital radio frequency electro-optic performance
of Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) subject to 10-keV X-ray irradiation, which
mimics cumulative ionization effects in space flight. Silicon photonic MZMs
serve as excellent exemplars since they are interferometric devices comprised
of elements common to many integrated photonic circuits. Under standard bias
conditions, the irradiated MZMs exhibited significantly reduced bandwidth, a
corresponding eye closure and baud rate dependent increases in the estimated
error rate. The observed performance degradation is attributed to total
ionizing dose effects which leads to hole trapping at the silicon/silicon
dioxide waveguide interfaces as well as fast traps with energies near the
conduction band edge. Notably, when MZMs were irradiated with all leads
grounded, no radiation sensitivity to the electro-optic response was observed
highlighting the importance of testing under standard operating conditions for
ground-based radiation testing as well as on-orbit studies. Understanding the
radiation induced performance degradation of MZMs and other integrated photonic
devices is increasingly important for space and accelerator environments as
performance requirements and deployment opportunities increase.

Motivation: 该研究可能旨在探索 holographic principle 在不同 cosmological 前景下的应用。根据 de Sitter 空间流动和伪视界的相关知识，扩展 holographic 技术至包含小或零 cosmological constant 的情况，为研究量子引力作准备。

Method: 研究者先对现有 de Sitter 静态位图 holographic 技术进行一般化，然后将双层 holographic 需求量 prescription 应用于包含小或零 cosmological constant 的 de Sitter 空间。通过分析观察者中心的 causal patch 与父 de Sitter 区域的关系，分类研究不同情况下需要的 holographic 屏的数量。

Result: 结果表明，当观察者中心的 causal patch 与父 de Sitter 区域重合时，两种 holographic 屏足够记录全时空的几何学 entanglement entropy，且其最大值为父 de Sitter 区域的 Gibbons-Hawking 熵。当 causal patch 与父 de Sitter 区域断开时，需要更多层 holographic 屏。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了 holographic principle 的应用，提供了一种在特定 cosmological 背景下记录全时空的方法。未来可能进一步研究这些方法在量子引力理论中的应用。

Abstract: We generalize the de Sitter static patch holographic proposal and the bilayer
holographic entanglement entropy prescription to de Sitter geometries
containing a bubble of smaller positive or vanishing cosmological constant.
When the causal patch of an observer at the center of the bubble overlaps with
the ``parent'' de Sitter region, we propose that the full spacetime can be
holographically encoded on two holographic screens. The leading geometrical
entanglement entropy between the two screens, which can be constant or
time-dependent in some cases, never exceeds the Gibbons-Hawking entropy
associated with the ``parent'' de Sitter space. When the causal patch of the
observer at the center of the bubble is causally disconnected from the
``parent'' de Sitter region, the holographic proposal no longer applies, and
more than two holographic screens are required to encode the whole spacetime.

Method:  uses Schur-Weyl duality to construct the index, demonstrates its relevance by matching with supergravity below the black hole threshold, and reveals additional microstate sectors above the threshold.

Result:  the new index generalizes the standard index, offering more detailed information about microstates. It matches the modified elliptic genus below the black hole threshold and uncovers distinct microstate sectors above the threshold.

Conclusion:  the proposed supersymmetry index enhances our understanding of microstate structure in AdS3/CFT2, particularly in regions where the modified elliptic genus fails to provide information.

Abstract: We propose a new supersymmetry index for symmetric orbifold CFTs in the setup
of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. In a novel formulation for symmetric
orbifold CFTs based on the Schur-Weyl duality, we show how this index naturally
emerges and its protection follows from the detailed nature of exactly marginal
operators in these theories. This index is a one-parameter generalization of
the standard index and gives more fine-grained information about the structure
of microstates than previously available. For the case of the D1-D5 CFT for
$T^4$ we demonstrate precise matching of the new index between supergravity and
CFT below the black-hole threshold, where the standard index -- the modified
elliptic genus -- is trivial. Above the threshold, we uncover a decomposition
of black-hole microstates into distinct sectors, invisible to the modified
elliptic genus.

### [62] [The SymTFT for $N$-ality defects: Part I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19429)
*Justin Kaidi,Xiaoyi Shi,Soichiro Shimamori,Zhengdi Sun*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the construction of SymTFT for theories with N-ality extensions, involving gauging a Z_N symmetry, choosing a fractionalization class, and incorporating discrete torsion. The bulk Z_N symmetry choice is particularly involved and determines key boundary F-symbols. Under some conditions, the defects' properties align with Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between gauge symmetries and topological defects in higher-form symmetries is fundamental for advancing theoretical physics, particularly in the context of phase transitions, duality, and the behavior of defects in higher-dimensional spaces.

Method: The paper employs abstract algebra and category theory, specifically focusing on group theory and fusion categories. The authors derive explicit expressions for F-symbols by analyzing the interplay between bulk symmetries and boundary defects. They use pentagon and hexagon identities to relate different F-symbols and demonstrate how these symbols can produce known structures like Tambara-Yamagami categories under specific conditions.

Result: The authors establish that the bulk Z_N symmetry choice determines boundary F-symbols with a single incoming N-ality defect. The twisted gauging procedure is shown to preserve certain symmetries and allows for the construction of specific F-symbols which exhibit features reminiscent of Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories. The findings contribute to the classification of defects and boundaries in higher-form symmetry extensions.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for constructing SymTFTs in the presence of N-ality extensions. By linking bulk symmetry choices to boundary F-symbols through the lens of fractionalization and discrete torsion, the authors make progress in understanding the algebraic structures underlying these theories. For prime N, explicit F-symbols are provided, offering concrete examples that could guide future research in condensed matter and high-energy physics.

Abstract: In order to obtain the SymTFT for a theory with an $N$-ality extension of a
discrete, Abelian group $G$, one begins by considering a bulk $G$-gauge theory,
and then gauges an appropriate $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. This procedure involves
three choices: the choice of a suitable bulk $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, of a
fractionalization class, and of a discrete torsion. The first choice is,
somewhat surprisingly, the most involved, and in this paper we discuss it in
detail. In particular, we show that the choice of bulk $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry
determines all boundary $F$-symbols with a single incoming $N$-ality defect,
and that any theory with an $N$-ality symmetry is invariant under a certain
twisted gauging given in terms of these $F$-symbols. These $F$-symbols can
furthermore be input into the pentagon identities to obtain the other
$F$-symbols, up to freedoms related to the choices appearing in the second and
third steps of bulk gauging. Although many of our results hold for general $N$,
we restrict ourselves in some places to the case of $N=p$ prime. In particular,
for generic triality defects, we acquire explicit $F$-symbols which are
reminiscent of those in Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories.

Abstract: This work presents a study of the entanglement entropy (EE) in a class of
four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ linear quiver SCFTs deformed by the presence of a
VEV. We review the holographic backgrounds dual to these theories, and
calculate the EE for different Ryu-Takayanagi embeddings. We allow the
embeddings to explore, in addition to the usual spatial direction, the internal
coordinate $z$, associated with the quiver degrees of freedom. Via the
numerical optimization of splines on triangulations, we find the minimal
configuration and the value of the EE for the different embeddings and quiver
parameters. Our results agree with previous studies showcasing phase
transitions in the EE. We also provide novel results illuminating the
dependence of the EE on the fundamental and gauge degrees of freedom, signaling
partial deconfinement, which are worthy of further study.

*Jose J. Blanco-Pillado,Daniel Jiménez-Aguilar,Oriol Pujolàs*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper investigates the singular behaviors of $(2+1)$-dimensional domain wall strings under the effective Nambu-Goto description. The study identifies and classifies swallowtail bifurcations resulting from the collision of wiggles on these strings and the collapse of closed loops. Lattice simulations demonstrate that these singular features lead to significant energy emission, potentially with implications for cosmological domain wall collapse studies in higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the singular behaviors of domain wall strings is crucial for comprehending their dynamics and implications in cosmology, particularly in the context of early universe cosmology where domain wall collapse is a key phenomenon.

Method: The authors employ the effective Nambu-Goto description to predict singular behaviors, followed by lattice simulations to model the field theory evolution of thin walls and observe the energy emission associated with swallowtail bifurcations.

Result: The study reveals that swallowtail bifurcations, arising from the collision of wiggles and the collapse of closed loops, accurately replicate in lattice simulations. These findings suggest that singular evolutions could have important observable signatures in the collapse of domain wall networks in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights into the singularities of domain wall strings and their implications for cosmological scenarios, highlighting the importance of studying these features in higher-dimensional contexts.

Abstract: The effective Nambu-Goto description of $(2+1)$-dimensional domain walls
predicts singular behavior of its worldsheet resulting in swallowtail
bifurcations. This phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of cusps,
which emerge in different forms that we identify and classify. We describe in
detail how swallowtail bifurcations generically arise in the collision of
wiggles on straight domain wall strings, as well as in the collapse of closed
loops, even for smooth initial conditions. Remarkably, by means of accurate
lattice simulations, we find that these distinctive swallowtail features are
reproduced in the field theory evolution of sufficiently thin walls, typically
emitting a significant fraction of their initial energy in the process. These
results suggest that such singular evolutions could potentially have important
implications for the observable signatures associated with the collapse of
domain wall networks in (3+1) dimensions in the early universe.

Result: 因果冲突区域与已知解相似，但通过三曲率奇点保护了 chronology。

Conclusion: 该新解保护了 chronology，对于Lorentz不变量引力和AdS有效。

Abstract: We study causal properties of the recently found rotating black-hole solution
in the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating (LV)
gravity in four dimensions with the LV Maxwell field and a cosmological
constant $\Lambda (>-3/a^2)$ for an arbitrary rotation parameter $a$. The
region of non-trivial causality violation containing closed timelike curves is
exactly the same as in the Kerr-Newman or the Kerr-Newman-(Anti-)de Sitter
solution. Nevertheless, chronology is protected in the new rotating black hole
because the causality violating region becomes physically inaccessible by
exterior observers due to the new three-curvature singularity at its boundary
that is topologically two-torus including the usual ring singularity at
$(r,\theta)=(0,\pi/2)$. As a consequence, the physically accessible region
outside the torus singularity is causal everywhere.

Abstract: SYK models provide an interesting playground for exploring the $AdS_2/CFT_1$
correspondence. We focus on a class of SYK models that exhibit higher-spin
symmetry, whose gravity sector is described by a BF theory generalizing
Jackiw--Teitelboim gravity to higher spins. We further develop this framework
by constructing consistent interactions between higher-spin gauge fields and
scalar matter fields. Two concrete realizations are proposed: Model A, arising
from a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of
$\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$, and Model B, a perturbatively local Poisson
sigma-model with an infinite-dimensional target space. While both capture
higher-spin dynamics on $(A)dS_2$, they differ in their algebraic structures
and locality properties, thus offering complementary perspectives on
higher-spin holography.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the phase structure of QCD matter using a dynamical
Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton holographic model, using both thermodynamic and
dynamical observables. Depending on the warp factor, the model admits either a
standard confinement/deconfinement transition or a first-order \textit{specious
confinement}/deconfinement transition ending at a critical end point (CEP),
giving rise to a rich phase diagram with a supercritical region. We probe this
structure using both thermodynamic (heat capacity) and dynamical (squared speed
of sound, IR wall) observables. We show that the loci of maxima in the heat
capacity and minima in the sound speed define two distinct crossover lines
emanating from the CEP and extending into the supercritical region, each
tracing a different separation between confined-like and deconfined-like
matter. As a dynamical probe, the persistence of the IR wall introduces another
separation line, not emanating from the CEP, and reveals a triangular region,
before the CEP, where the system is thermodynamically confined but dynamically
deconfined. We further study the Schwinger effect as a nonperturbative probe of
vacuum instability, determining the critical and threshold electric fields in
both confined and deconfined phases. In the specious confined phase and in the
confined-like phase beyond the critical end point, these fields depend on
temperature and chemical potential, unlike in the standard confined phase, and
we are able to trace their behavior for the first time including the
supercritical region. Our results highlight the complementarity of
thermodynamic and dynamical probes in mapping the QCD phase diagram and, in
particular, establish the Schwinger threshold and critical fields as sensitive
diagnostics of confinement not only in the known phase transitions but also in
the supercritical regime.

Abstract: We consider a class of theories containing power-law terms in both the Ricci
scalar and a scalar field, including their non-minimal couplings. As a first
step, we systematically classify all non-trivial cases with a propagating
scalar field that arise from the simplest general power-law formulation, which
contains the minimal number of terms. We then analyze each case in detail,
focusing on the structure of the degrees of freedom, by both formulating the
theories in the Einstein frames and focusing on the singular points in the
Jordan frame. We demonstrate that such theories can give rise to different, and
sometimes unexpected structure of the modes, that can change at the leading
order depending on the background.

Abstract: We analyze the vacuum fluctuations and the stress-energy tensor of a scalar
field of mass $M$ in a conical spacetime, where the topological singularity at
the apex requires boundary conditions for the field equation. The necessity of
boundary conditions was established by Kay and Studer in the early 1990s, but
the consequences of their arbitrariness, represented here by a parameter $q$,
for renormalized observables have not been examined. While for $M=0$ stability
is achieved only under Dirichlet boundary conditions, for $M>q$ the field is
stable and a localized mode emerges. This mode admits a natural interpretation
as a covariant model of an extended particle detector, which allows us to
investigate how such detectors modify the local vacuum structure. In this
framework, the renormalized stress-energy tensor offers a natural way to
quantify the influence of the detector on the surrounding spacetime.

*Victor Hugo M. Ramos,João Paulo M. Pitelli,João C. A. Barata*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR:  papers discusses a particle detector model in quantum field theory on a spacetime with a spatial origin removed, using Robin boundary conditions. The detector gets bound-state solutions and the stress-energy tensor is studied. The approach extends traditional detectors like Unruh-DeWitt to more general geometries like conical and global monopole spacetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses spacetime singularities and boundary conditions in quantum field theory. It explores how boundary conditions influence particle detectors and stress-energy tensors, aiming to generalize detector models beyond flat spacetime.

Method: The authors use quantum field theory on curved spacetime, removing the spatial origin and employing Robin boundary conditions. They solve the radial equation for bound states and analyze the stress-energy tensor's decomposition.

Result: The detector model displays contributions from discrete bound states, boundary condition modifications, and Dirichlet sectors. The stress-energy tensor shows cancellation of discrete terms, revealing that the detector's stress-energy is dictated by boundary conditions, leading to a unified framework for such detectors in various geometries including naked singularities.

Conclusion: This framework provides a relativistic and boundary-condition driven approach for localizing detectors, which is a significant advancement beyond the traditional Unruh-DeWitt detector model, enabling extensions to non-trivial spacetime geometries.

Abstract: We develop a localized particle detector model formulated as a massive
quantum field on Minkowski spacetime with the spatial origin excised. To render
the problem well-posed at the puncture, we impose boundary conditions at the
excised point, which we take to be of Robin type. This setup yields a discrete
sector, given by bound-state solutions of the radial equation with real,
positive frequencies, which characterizes the detector. We construct the full
two-point function and show its decomposition into: (i) the discrete radial
bound-state sector, (ii) the boundary condition modified continuous sector, and
(iii) the unmodified Dirichlet sector. We then compute the detector field's
stress-energy tensor and prove its covariant conservation. For the specific
localized modes in this setup, the discrete-sector contribution cancels in the
complete stress-energy tensor, leaving only boundary-condition induced terms.
Notably, the discrete modes crucial to localized field-based detectors emerge
naturally from the boundary conditions, without ad hoc confining potentials,
providing a fully relativistic framework that extends the traditional
Unruh-DeWitt paradigm. This mechanism is not restricted to Minkowski spacetime:
the same construction can be applied to massive fields on backgrounds with
naked singularities, such as conical and global monopole spacetimes, offering a
unified route to detector localization in a broad class of geometries.

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解超对称规范理论中行列式现象提供了一种新的非扰框架。结果表明，行列式的非扰结构在各个 't Hooft共轭下都是统一的，这有助于更深入地理解这些规范理论的基本属性。

Abstract: We analyze determinants associated with Bessel kernels and generic symbol
functions, which govern a class of observables across all values of the 't
Hooft coupling in supersymmetric gauge theories. Previous approaches, based on
integro-differential equations, have provided systematic strong-coupling
expansions for the logarithms of these determinants, expressed through the
moments of the symbol. The resulting asymptotic series, once completed with
non-perturbative terms, allowed the leading resurgence relations to be tested.
In this Letter we focus directly on the determinants themselves, and we uncover
a strikingly simple non-perturbative structure: all trans-series corrections
share a universal form, while the moments transform in a direct and intuitive
way. This simplicity points to an underlying organizing principle for the
non-perturbative dynamics of gauge theory observables.

Abstract: Recently, a one-to-one correspondence between non-trivial non-Hermitian
topology and directional amplification has been demonstrated, theoretically and
experimentally, for the case of one complex band. Here, we extend our framework
to multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from
trivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new
quantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to
define physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour
and to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian
topology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both
invariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give
rise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our
results with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D
non-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is
relevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage
for applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal
sensors.

Abstract: Scattering of electrons from chiral spin textures such as the skyrmions is an
emerging research area due to its richness in topological quantum transport,
which is significant for spintronic devices. We study the dynamical process of
scattering of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian
wavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular
dependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the
spin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial
outcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities
irrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts
associated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound
state at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics,
the numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary
spin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin
transport.

Abstract: Present information and communication technologies are largely based on
electronic devices, which suffer from heat generation and high power
consumption. Alternatives like spintronics and magnonics, which harness the
spin degree of freedom, offer compelling pathways to overcome these fundamental
limitations of charge-based electronics. Magnonics relies on spin waves, the
collective excitations of magnetic moments in magnetically ordered materials,
to achieve processing and transport of information at microwave frequencies
without relying on charge currents. However, efficient means for
all-electrical, high-resolution, semiconductor-compatible readout of
information encoded in spin waves are still missing. Here, we demonstrate the
electrical detection of spin waves using a nanoscale magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ) cell fabricated in a state-of-the-art complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) production line. By engineering the dynamic
coupling between spin waves and the magnetization state of the MTJ, we
demonstrate transduction of spin-wave excitations into measurable electrical
signals with high fidelity. Moreover, through these measurements, we find
spectral line widths, associated with nonlinear processes, down to a few
hundreds of kHz, which opens up new perspectives for spin waves as quantum
transducers.

Motivation: Improving quantum dot measurement speed and initialization time is critical for scalable quantum computing.

Method: Neural network-based autotuning with FPGA integration in QET.

Result: 9.8x reduction in measurement time, 2.2x speedup in quantum dot initialization.

Conclusion: This approach efficiently enhanced measurement and system tuning, pivotal for advancing spin qubit processors.

Abstract: Spin qubits need to operate within a very precise voltage space around charge
state transitions to achieve high-fidelity gates. However, the stability
diagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to
acquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state
increases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability
diagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor.
Currently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach
shows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in
the number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an
autotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by

Motivation: Exploring nonlinear magnon generation and control in resonators has potential applications in magnonic signal processing.

Method: Experiments using an on-chip resonator, thin Co Fe B film, micro-focused Brillouin light scattering, and in-plane magnetic field manipulation.

Result: Fundamental and higher-order magnetoelastic waves observed at varying coupling strengths, with analytical model confirming generation of subharmonics and harmonics in strong coupling regime.

Conclusion: Phonons enable control of nonlinear magnon behavior, offering new magnonic signal processing pathways.

Abstract: We experimentally observe the generation of magnon harmonics and subharmonics
in an on-chip surface acoustic wave resonator incorporating a thin
Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ film, using micro-focused Brillouin light
scattering. In our devices, rotating the in-plane magnetic field allows
continuous tuning of the magnon-phonon coupling from weak to strong within the
same resonator. In the weak coupling regime, we only observe fundamental
magnetoelastic wave signal at $f_{1}$. Conversely, in the strong coupling
regime, in addition to the fundamental magnetoelastic wave, we observe
subharmonic and harmonic signals at $3/2f_{1}$, $2f_{1}$, and $3f_{1}$, which
are well reproduced by our analytical model. Our results establish phonons as a
means to generate and control nonlinear magnons in the strong coupling regime,
providing a new route for magnonic signal processing.

Abstract: Quantum states naturally represent symmetry groups, though often in a
projective sense. Intriguingly, the projective nature of crystalline symmetries
has remained underexplored until very recently. A series of groundbreaking
theoretical and experimental studies have now brought this to light,
demonstrating that projective representations of crystal symmetries lead to
remarkable consequences in condensed matter physics and various artificial
crystals, particularly in their connection to topological phenomena. In this
article, we explain the basic ideas and notions underpinning these recent
developments and share our perspective on this emerging research area. We
specifically highlight that the appearance of momentum-space nonsymmorphic
symmetry is a unique feature of projective crystal symmetry representations.
This, in turn, has the profound consequence of reducing the fundamental domain
of momentum space to all possible flat compact manifolds, which include torus
and Klein bottle in 2D and the ten platycosms in 3D, presenting a significantly
richer landscape for topological structures than conventional settings.
Finally, the ongoing efforts and promising future research directions are
discussed.

Abstract: Magnonic waveguide based on domain wall (DW) is considered as a crucial
breakthrough toward the realization of magnonic nanocircuits. However, the
effective control of spin waves propagating in DWs remains to be explored.
Here, we construct a magnonic crystal (MC) by using a chain of the domain wall
skyrmions (DWSKs) to manipulate the spin-wave propagation in DWs. We show that
the DWSK chain can be created by leveraging voltage-controlled
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The DWSK-based MC opens magnonic bandgaps,
which can be dynamically adjusted through magnetic fields modulating the DWSK
size. Furthermore, the manipulation of spin waves by the DWSK-based MC
maintains robust in curved DW, demonstrating its adaptability to complex device
architectures. Our work provides an effective method to control the spin-wave
propagation in DWs and paves the way for designing energy-efficient magnonic
nanocircuits.

TL;DR: We introduce a new Z2 topological invariant for 3D band structures in the CI symmetry class, which distinguishes topological phases not detectable by existing indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in understanding topological invariants for 3D CI symmetric systems, particularly those with PT and PC symmetries.

Method: The authors define a Z2 invariant based on the eta-invariant and spin-Chern-Simons (spin-CS) action under PC symmetry quantization.

Result: The invariant is shown to be additive, dependent on spin structure, and capable of distinguishing topological phases in lattice models.

Conclusion: This new invariant provides a tool to classify and detect topological phases in CI symmetry-protected systems.

Abstract: We construct a previously missing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant for
three-dimensional band structures in symmetry class CI defined by parity-time
(PT) and parity-particle-hole (PC) symmetries. PT symmetry allows one to define
a real Berry connection and, based on the $\eta$-invariant, a
spin-Chern--Simons (spin-CS) action. We show that PC symmetry quantizes the
spin-CS action to $\{0,2\pi\}$ with $4\pi$ periodicity, thereby yielding a
well-defined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. This invariant is additive under direct
sums of isolated band structures, reduces to a known $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index when
a global Takagi factorization exists, and in general depends on the choice of
spin structure. Finally, we demonstrate lattice models in which this newly
introduced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant distinguishes topological phases that
cannot be detected by the previously known topological indices.

Abstract: The fundamental role of magnetic materials in modern science and technology
has driven a rapid surge in research on unconventional magnetism in recent

magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space,
have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and
technological applications. Among these, $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the
pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic
magnetic order of $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate,
numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed
in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the
altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$,
systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band
properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate
surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating
evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting
results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future

TL;DR: Graphene's unique electronic structure allows studying quantum Hall effect breakdown across various energy scales. This work examines the breakdown of quantum Hall effect in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation from DC to 10 GHz. The conductance is described by variable range hopping (VRH), with hopping energies extracted from temperature and field-driven measurements. VRH thermometry distinguishes between cold and hot electron regimes. The results show a crossover from non-ohmic VRH dominated by fields to ohmic transport dominated by Joule heating in the quantum Hall regime of graphene.

Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms and breakdown conditions of the quantum Hall effect is crucial for advancing semiconductor physics and device applications.

Method: The study uses high-mobility graphene Corbino devices subjected to broadband excitation. Conductance analysis under various conditions reveals the dominant transport mechanisms.

Result: The crossover between non-ohmic field-dominated VRH and ohmic Joule heating-dominated transport is observed in the quantum Hall regime of graphene.

Conclusion: Graphene's quantum Hall effect breakdown under broadband excitation is governed by a transition from field to Joule heating dominated transport.

Abstract: Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and
valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall
effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the
breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband
excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is
consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping
energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH
thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime,
which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our
results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is
governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic,
Joule-heating-dominated transport.

Result: 成功生成了新的拓扑相和 Majorana 模式，扩展了 hosts 拓扑 超导体的材料范围。

Conclusion:  Floquet 工程化提供了创造新拓扑相和 Majorana 模式的新途径。

Abstract: Topological superconductor is regarded as an ideal candidate for topological
quantum computing due to its ability to simulate the enigmatic Majorana
fermions that satisfy non-Abelian statistics. Previous studies revealed that
symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders
of Majorana modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of
Majorana modes. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this
symmetry-imposed constraint on topological phases. By applying periodic driving
on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of
first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order Majorana modes
are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological superconductors
with coexisting first-order Majorana boundary modes and second-order Majorana
corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single
gap are generated at ease by the periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing
understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an
avenue for the creation of exotic topological superconductors without altering
symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host
topological superconductor.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the quantum Hall effect and finds that the localization length in broken-symmetry quantum Hall states of graphene shows significant non-universality, deviating from expected scaling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the motivation to understand the quantum Hall effect more deeply, particularly discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.

Method: The method employed involves systematic measurement of the localization length in graphene-based quantum Hall states with broken symmetry.

Result: The results reveal marked variations in the minimum localization length, up to a tenfold difference, along with clear deviations from universal scaling as predicted by percolation theory.

Conclusion: The findings imply that non-universal scaling behaviors in the quantum Hall effect cannot be fully explained by conventional percolation theory and require further theoretical exploration.

Abstract: The quantum Hall effect hosts quantum phase transitions in which the
localization length, that is the size of disorder-induced bulk localized
states, is governed by universal scaling from percolation theory. However, this
universal character is not systematically observed in experiments, including
very recent ones in extremely clean devices. Here we explore this
non-universality by systematically measuring the localization length in
broken-symmetry quantum Hall states of graphene. Depending on the nature and
gap size of these states, we observe differences of up to a tenfold in the
minimum localization length, accompanied by clear deviations from universal
scaling. Our results, as well as the previously observed non-universality, are
fully captured by a simple picture based on the co-existence of localized
states from two successive sub-Landau levels.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of correlated hopping on

Using the accurate numerical renormalization group method, we analyze the
transport characteristics, focusing on the interplay between electronic

We calculate the electrical conductance and thermopower as functions of the dot
energy level, lead polarization, and the amplitude of correlated hopping.
Moreover, we analyze the effect of competing correlations on the Kondo
resonance and discuss the asymmetry of conductance peaks under the influence of
the exchange field. We demonstrate that the presence of correlated hopping is
responsible for asymmetric spin-dependent transport characteristics. Our
results provide valuable insight into how correlated hopping affects
spin-dependent transport and thermoelectric efficiency in quantum dot systems

Abstract: In this work, we propose performing key operations in quantum computation and

drive a Raman transition to generate photons with specific temporal shapes and
to absorb, and hence detect, single photons. The strong atom-cavity interaction
can also be used to implement the atom-photon controlled-phase gate, which can
then be used to construct photon-photon gates, create photonic cluster states,
and perform non-demolition detection of single photons. We provide numerics

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable and programmable quantum sensing platform for fundamental physics exploration.

Abstract: Quantum networks are emerging as powerful platforms for sensing,

quantum sensing network based on entangled atomic ensembles, where optical
clock qubits emulate mass superpositions in atom and atom-clock interferometry.
Our approach uniquely combines scalability to large atom numbers with minimal
control requirements, relying only on collective addressing of internal atomic
states. This enables the creation of both non-local and local superpositions
with spatial separations beyond those achievable in conventional
interferometry. Starting from Bell-type seed states distributed via photonic
channels, collective operations within atomic ensembles coherently build
many-body mass superpositions sensitive to gravitational redshift. The
resulting architecture realizes a non-local Ramsey interferometer, with
gravitationally induced phase shifts observable in network-based interference
patterns. Beyond extending the spatial reach of mass superpositions, our scheme
establishes a scalable, programmable platform to probe the interface of quantum
mechanics and gravity, and offers a new experimental pathway to test atom and
atom-clock interferometer proposals in a network-based quantum laboratory.

Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of
infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear
optics, particularly strong-field physics and high-harmonic generation.
However, theoretical studies were focused on interactions with single-atoms
only, neglecting that under realistic conditions light propagates through the
media. This raises two key questions: How does BSV propagates in strongly
light-driven nonlinear media, and under what conditions it can generate
observable nonlinear signals? We address these questions by introducing a fully
quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media using
high-harmonic generation as a nonlinear observable. We found that the infrared
photon losses, atomic ground-state depletion and atomic ionization, induce
decoherence effects which significantly limit the propagation length in the
medium, and reduce the harmonic yield by more than two orders of magnitude
compared to that produced by coherent laser light. Nevertheless, we establish
the conditions under which BSV generated harmonics can be detected. Our results
lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear
optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the fidelity of quantum logic gates is crucial for the development of reliable quantum computing systems. The presence of spontaneous emission, a fundamental quantum noise mechanism, poses a significant challenge to achieving this goal.

Method: The authors analyze the dynamics of qubits under spontaneous emission using a modified Schrödinger equation conditioned on no-decay events. They employ quantum error correction and mitigation strategies to address the issue, applying their framework to atomic qubit systems.

Result: The study demonstrates that spontaneous emission must be carefully considered in the design of high-fidelity quantum logic gates. The proposed methods improve the fidelity of gate operations on qubits, even when coherence is preserved.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of accounting for spontaneous emission in quantum computing architectures and provides a foundation for developing more robust quantum logic gates through error mitigation techniques.

Abstract: As a fundamental phenomenon in quantum systems, spontaneous emission
constitutes an inevitable source of error, which ultimately degrades the
fidelity of quantum logic gates. A successful quantum logic gate needs to
operate on the condition that no decay event, such as spontaneous emission,
occurs. Such successes can be ensured by post-selection based on syndrome
extraction according to the theory of quantum error correction or quantum error
mitigation. In this case, the wave function of qubits remains a pure state but
is subject to additional influences from spontaneous emission, even without
actual decay events. Therefore, such a process must be appropriately described
by a modified version of Schr\"odinger equation for the dynamics conditioned on
no-decay. Calculations reveal that this effect must be seriously taken into
consideration for the design of high-fidelity quantum logic gates. With respect
to realistic experimental conditions, even if the coherence is well preserved,
improving the fidelity of manipulating physical qubits requires careful
consideration of the subtle influences of decay processes such as spontaneous
emission. Specifically, the gate and readout processes in the atomic qubit
platform are discussed.

Abstract: We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model,
having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an
external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the
single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for
arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified
through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the
time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson
statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model
for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical
results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B
\textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we
extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that
the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$,
these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral
statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with
perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson
statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r
\rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute
the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S
\rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the
limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some
potential experimental realizations of our model.

Abstract: We demonstrate a highly sensitive real-time magnetometry method at two
measurement points. This magnetometry method is based on the frequency-division
multiplexing of continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance. We use
two ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers separated by 3.6 mm to measure a
magnetic field. A different bias field is applied to the two NV ensembles to
resolve the resonance peak for each ensemble in the frequency space and enables
the multiplexed magnetometry at the two points. The sensitivities achieved at
the measurement points are $21~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and
$22~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$. The proposed magnetometry method can be expanded to
include more measurement points and shorter spacing. The capability of
real-time measurement at numerous points with short spacing and high
sensitivity is beneficial for various applications, including biomagnetic
sensing, geophysical research, and material science.

Abstract: We present an efficient quantum algorithm for a structured state
discrimination problem we call the subspace decoding task. Building on this, we
show that the algorithm enables efficient and optimal decoding of certain
families of structured classical linear codes transmitted over binary-input
classical-quantum pure-state channels. Such decoders can substantially enhance
the performance of quantum algorithms based on Regev's reduction, such as
decoded quantum interferometry. In particular, we obtain optimal and efficient
quantum decoders for all classical codes with efficient trellis
representations. As an application, we design a quantum decoder for turbo codes
and, through density evolution, demonstrate decoding thresholds that surpass
the Shannon bound and closely approach the Holevo bound.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子平台中的 SPAM 错误分析和抵消提供了新的方法和见解，有助于提高量子门的准确性并优化抵消策略。

Abstract: In many platforms, errors from state-preparation and measurement (SPAM)
dominate single-qubit gate errors. To inform further hardware improvements and
the development of more effective SPAM mitigation strategies, it is necessary
to separately characterize the error contributions from state-preparation (SP)
and measurement (M). Here, we show how to construct a protocol that can
efficiently and separately characterize the SP and M error parameters by using
only high-fidelity single-qubit gates and repeated single-qubit measurements
without reset. The measurements are assumed to be non-destructive and M errors
are taken to be (spatially and temporally) uncorrelated and classical. Notably,
the circuit depth of the protocol is independent of system size, and the target
parameters may be characterized to a precision that is only limited by the
number of experimental repetitions. We employ our protocol for the parallel
characterization of SPAM errors on multiple qubits in the IBM Quantum Platform
devices, where we find SP infidelities up to $6.57\%$ and readout assignment
errors up to $19.1\%$. Using numerical simulations, we also demonstrate how
measurement-error mitigation that does not properly account for SP errors
generally leads to a biased estimate of measured observable expectation values.

Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of
endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to
identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued
random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense,
super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are
boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion
similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the
theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment
interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix
gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that
manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener
information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum
system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.

Abstract: Optical frequency combs are utilized in a wide range of optical applications,
including atomic clocks, interferometers, and various sensing technologies.
They are often generated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in chip-integrated
microring resonators, a method that requires low optical input power due to the
high quality factor of the resonator, making it highly efficient. While the
classical properties of optical frequency combs are well-established, this work
investigates the quantum-mechanical characteristics of the individual comb
modes. We derive simple equations describing the squeezing, second-order
correlation and joint spectral intensity (JSI) between the generated signal and
idler modes. Even with the resonator's detuning limiting the generation of
signal- and idler pairs with significant photon numbers, many still exhibit
substantial squeezing and entanglement. It is demonstrated that the design and
dispersion characteristics of the ring resonator significantly impact the
quantum features of the modes. Depending on the design, it is possible to
enhance either the particle or mode entanglement of specific signal- and idler
pairs. Thus, our findings enable the optimization for utilizing quantum
frequency combs in various applications, including quantum sensing, computing
and communication.

Motivation: Scalability is crucial for future quantum technologies to be practical and widespread.

Method: The project combines hardware, error correction, and network architecture advancements, evaluating both near-term and scalable solutions.

Result: Significant progress has been made in developing quantum repeaters and network control systems.

Conclusion: InterQnet demonstrates progress toward scalable quantum communications, though further research is needed to fully realize its potential.

Abstract: Quantum communications have progressed significantly, moving from a
theoretical concept to small-scale experiments to recent metropolitan-scale
demonstrations. As the technology matures, it is expected to revolutionize
quantum computing in much the same way that classical networks revolutionized
classical computing. Quantum communications will also enable breakthroughs in
quantum sensing, metrology, and other areas. However, scalability has emerged
as a major challenge, particularly in terms of the number and heterogeneity of
nodes, the distances between nodes, the diversity of applications, and the
scale of user demand. This paper describes InterQnet, a multidisciplinary
project that advances scalable quantum communications through a comprehensive
approach that improves devices, error handling, and network architecture.
InterQnet has a two-pronged strategy to address scalability challenges:
InterQnet-Achieve focuses on practical realizations of heterogeneous quantum
networks by building and then integrating first-generation quantum repeaters
with error mitigation schemes and centralized automated network control
systems. The resulting system will enable quantum communications between two
heterogeneous quantum platforms through a third type of platform operating as a
repeater node. InterQnet-Scale focuses on a systems study of architectural
choices for scalable quantum networks by developing forward-looking models of
quantum network devices, advanced error correction schemes, and entanglement
protocols. Here we report our current progress toward achieving our scalability
goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore Heisenberg-limited measurements without entangled states and resolve contradictions in scaling laws between cavity superradiance and quantum limits.

Method: Coupled qubits with a common measurable environment, analysis of the Tavis-Cummings model with superradiance approximation.

Result: Findings contradict themselves due to conflicting scaling predictions.

Conclusion: Must reconcile superradiance effects with quantum limits for robust quantum metrology applications.

Abstract: In a seminal paper [8] it was shown that Heisenberg-limited measurements
could be achieved without using entangled states by coupling the quantum
resources to a common environment that could be measured, at least, in part.
The authors also claimed that their method would be robust under decoherence,
and, in particular, applied it to derive an analytical expression to measure
the change in length of an optical cavity within the Tavis-Cummings model using
the superradiance approximation, which would still have a 1/N scaling. Here, we
show that the analytical derivations in [8] are incompatible with the cavity
superradiance, leading to the standard quantum-limited scaling 1/\sqrt{N}.

Conclusion:  important step towards enabling reliable polarization measurements in challenging imaging scenarios. the method opens new possibilities for applications requiring low photon flux, such as space-based imaging or medical imaging devices.

Abstract: Polarimetry and optical imaging techniques face challenges in photon-starved
scenarios, where the low number of detected photons imposes a trade-off between
image resolution, integration time, and sample sensitivity. Here we introduce a
quantum-inspired method, functional classical shadows, for reconstructing a
polarization profile in the low photon-flux regime. Our method harnesses
correlations between neighbouring datapoints, based on the recent realisation
that machine learning can estimate multiple physical quantities from a small
number of non-identical samples. This is applied to the experimental
reconstruction of polarization as a function of the wavelength. Although the
quantum formalism helps structuring the problem, our approach suits arbitrary
intensity regimes.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The reliable transmission of quantum information remains a central challenge
in the presence of environmental noise. In particular, maintaining high
teleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence,
which disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation
techniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic
environments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be
harnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation? In this work, we
address this problem by analyzing how non-Markovian dynamics influence
teleportation fidelity. We employ a statistical speed approach based on the
Hilbert Schmidt norm to witness information backflow and monitor the system's
instantaneous evolution rate. Our study focuses on two measurement-based
strategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal
(QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM)
with post selection and QMR. Through analytical expressions and detailed
numerical simulations, we demonstrate that both strategies can enhance
teleportation fidelity under non-Markovian noise. Notably, the EAM-based scheme
exhibits superior robustness, achieving high fidelity even without fine-tuned
parameters. Our results establish a concrete link between non-Markovian memory
effects, statistical speed, and coherence preservation, offering practical
insights for the design of resilient quantum communication protocols.

*Parker Kuklinski,Benjamin Rempfer,Justin Elenewski,Kevin Obenland*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Block-encodings are widely used in quantum computing to represent data within unitary operators. While unstructured methods are applicable to arbitrary data, they suffer from hidden costs and poor accuracy. This paper demonstrates that even for a small 6-qubit encoding, structure-agnostic techniques require intractable resources compared to those that respect the mathematical structure of the block. The paper concludes that unstructured encoding methods should only be used in the most unusual circumstances, contradicting existing literature that often employs these methods for quantum algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely explores the limitations of unstructured methods in quantum computing and proposes more efficient structured approaches for specific encoding tasks, challenging conventional practices in the field.

Method: The paper details the comparison between structure-agnostic and structure-aware encoding methods, evaluating their resource requirements and accuracy for a 6-qubit encoding task. It presents evidence that structured methods are more efficient.

Result: The research shows that structured encoding methods are more resource-efficient and accurate compared to unstructured ones, even for small-scale encoding tasks. This suggests that unstructured methods should be used cautiously unless in the most extreme scenarios.

Conclusion: The study challenges the conventional use of unstructured encoding methods in quantum computing, suggesting that they should only be employed in highly unusual circumstances. The findings provide a rationale for preferring structured methods in most applications.

Abstract: Block-encodings are ubiquitous in quantum computing as a way to represent
data within a unitary operator. While several unstructured methods are
applicable to arbitrary data, these techniques are burdened by hidden costs and
poor accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that, even for a small 6-qubit
encoding, these structure-agnostic techniques require wildly intractable
resources. We compare these resources with an encoding method which respects a
mathematical representation of the block, leading to the conclusion that
unstructured encoding mehtods should only be used in the most extenuating
circumstances. This finding runs contrary to existing literature on quantum
algorithms which often employ structure-agnostic methods.

Result: 添加可 correction 要求后，唯一性定理恢复有效。

Conclusion: 编码方案的唯一性依赖于可 correction 的条件和错误校正操作。

Abstract: Holographic codes are a type of error-correcting code with extra geometric
structure ensured by a ``complementary recovery'' property: given a division of
the physical Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ into $\mathcal{H}_A$ and
$\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}$, and an algebra of physical operators
$\mathcal{M}\subseteq (\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_A)\otimes I_{\mathcal{H}_{\bar
A}})$, the logical operators in $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_L)\simeq
\mathcal{L}(P\mathcal{H})$ which can be created by acting in $\mathcal{M}$ are
identical to the logical operators whose expectation values cannot be altered
by acting in the commutant $\mathcal{M}^\prime$, and vice versa. In
arXiv:2110.14691, a uniqueness theorem was stated: the only possible tuple of
(code, bipartition, algebra) which can exhibit complementary recovery is the
maximal one $\mathcal{M}=P(\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_A)\otimes
I_{\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}})P$. We point out a counterexample to this result,
using a ``non-adjacent'' bipartition of a four-qubit code proposed in
arXiv:2110.14691. We show that the failure of uniqueness is due to a failure to
enforce error correction against erasure of $\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}$, which
requires enforcing the algebraic Knill-Laflamme condition $[P E_i^\dagger E_j
P,\mathcal{M}]=0$ for each pair of error operators. When we add the additional
requirement that $\mathcal{M}$ be correctable with respect to this channel,
uniqueness is restored, and we re-prove the theorem of arXiv:2110.14691 with
this added assumption. We present the list of bipartitions of the ``atomic''
holographic codes in arXiv:2110.14691 in which the correctability assumption
can be violated.

Abstract: Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for
building scalable quantum networks, with electro-optics conversion emerging as
a promising approach. Recent experiments, however, observe significant quality
factor degradation in superconducting microwave cavities when realizing the
electro optics transducers. Here, we identify the piezomechanical scattering,
where microwave photon loss through phonon radiation into substrate, as a
universal dissipation mechanism in these hybrid quantum devices. By
establishing a direct analogy to Rayleigh scattering theory, we derive
universal scaling laws governing phononic dissipation process. Our analysis
reveals a fundamental trade-off that optimizing coherent transduction coupling
inevitably increases dissipation, regardless of the configurations of microwave
and optical cavities. We propose potential strategies to overcome this
challenge. These findings establish piezomechanical scattering as a critical
design constraint for quantum transducers and provide insights to optimize
their performances toward practical quantum networking.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the potential applications of these findings in quantum computing, theoretical physics, and topology, suggesting that the relationship between TQNNs, amplituhedra, and topological structures could open new avenues for research and technological development in these fields.

Abstract: We study the relationship between computation and scattering both

Abstract: The optical cavity undergoes a quantum phase transition when the strength of
a two-photon drive exceeds a critical point (CP), and the great sensitivity of
CP in sensing has been recognized. However, these methodologies are customized
to sense linear perturbations, and quantum noise is divergent at the CP. Here,
we propose a scheme for sensing the weak Kerr nonlinearity in an optical cavity
by both single- and two-photon drives, based on the CP for phase transition. We
show that the mean photon number around the CP induced by the two-photon drive
sensitively depends on the Kerr coefficient in the optical cavity, so that the
weak anharmonicity in the optical cavity can be measured sensitively by
detecting the mean photon number. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
single-photon drive provides an effective way to suppress the quantum noise and
improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This scheme can be applied to detecting the
weak nonlinear interactions in a wide range of optical systems.

symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges
near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the
finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically
and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional
ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field. Our results provide
new insights into the mechanism of Lee-Yang theory and open avenues for
exploring unexplored landscapes of phase transitions in quantum many-body
systems.

Abstract: Avoided crossings (ACs) are hallmark signatures of mode interaction in
quantum and wave systems. Open microcavities whose resonances are naturally
described as quasi-normal modes (QNMs) with complex eigenfrequencies offer a
convenient platform to observe how openness and loss reorganize modal
structure. We introduce a compact \emph{quadrature space} framework that
represents a complex QNM by probability weights on its real and imaginary
quadratures, and we apply Shannon-type measures to these distributions. This
representation separates marginal spreading of each quadrature from inter
quadrature correlation and is robust to nodal sets and exterior zero amplitude
points. Applying the method to AC regions, we find that delocalization is
driven not only by broadening of individual quadratures but also by a
pronounced increase in internal correlation near at the AC, revealing an
internal reorganization of resonant modes in non-Hermitian settings. The
approach is broadly transferable to other open resonator platforms and provides
a general information-theoretic diagnostic for openness-driven mode
interactions.

Conclusion: 通过动态优化选择量子态扩散过程和量子跳跃过程，可以显著降低量子力学模拟的方差和计算误差。

Abstract: Stochastic unraveling schemes are powerful computational tools for simulating
Lindblad equations, offering significant reductions in memory requirements.
However, this advantage is accompanied by increased stochastic uncertainty, and
the question of optimal unraveling remains open. In this work, we investigate
unraveling schemes driven by Brownian motion or Poisson processes and present a
comprehensive parametric characterization of these approaches. For the case of
a single Lindblad operator and one noise term, this parametric family provides
a complete description for unraveling scheme with pathwise norm-preservation.
We further analytically derive dynamically optimal quantum state diffusion
(DO-QSD) and dynamically optimal quantum jump process (DO-QJP) that minimize
the short-time growth of the variance of an observable. Compared to jump
process ansatz, DO-QSD offers two notable advantages: firstly, the variance for
DO-QSD can be rigorously shown not to exceed that of any jump-process ansatz
locally in time; secondly, it has very simple expressions. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed DO-QSD scheme may achieve substantial reductions
in the variance of observables and the resulting simulation error.

*Francesco Perciavalle,Gian Marco Rizzo,Francesco Plastina,Nicola Lo Gullo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the phenomenon of local reminiscence in the PXP model using Rydberg atom arrays. It finds that specific initial states, such as $	heta$-symmetric and blockaded states, exhibit robust local memory retention, with fidelities approaching unity and reduced fluctuations as the system size grows. The study contributes to understanding quantum many-body scars and constrained dynamics in complex quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum systems, particularly those exhibiting non-ergodic dynamics, is crucial for advancing our knowledge in quantum physics and condensed matter physics. This work contributes to elucidating the mechanisms behind quantum many-body scars and local reminiscence.

Method: The research employs local fidelity and dynamics of local observables as metrics to assess memory retention. The PXP model, realized in Rydberg atom arrays, is analyzed using these metrics to identify and characterize states with robust memory retention.

Result: The study identifies $	heta$-symmetric and blockaded states as key contributors to local reminiscence. These states exhibit near-perfect fidelity and suppressed fluctuations, indicating their ability to retain memory of initial conditions despite system size increases.

Conclusion: This finding supports the idea that non-ergodic regimes in quantum systems can maintain local memory while supporting complex global dynamics, offering new insights into quantum many-body scars and constrained spin dynamics.

Abstract: We study the emergence of local reminiscence in the PXP model, a constrained
spin system realized in Rydberg atom arrays. The spectrum of this model is
characterized by a majority of eigenstates that satisfy the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis, alongside a set of nonthermal eigenstates, known as
quantum many-body scars, that violate it. While generic initial states lead to
thermalization consistent with eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, special
configurations generate non-ergodic dynamics and preserve memory of the initial
state. In this work, we explore local memory retention using local fidelity and
the dynamics of local observables. We find that two specific states,
$\theta$-symmetric and blockaded states, exhibit robust local reminiscence,
with fidelities near unity and suppressed fluctuations as the system size
increases. Our results show that non-ergodic regimes can sustain stable local
memory while still allowing for complex global dynamics, providing new insights
into quantum many-body scars and constrained dynamics.

*Dylan Harley,Freek Witteveen,Daniel Malz*

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that, for injective PEPS with a sufficiently high injectivity threshold, local observable evaluation becomes tractable, but remains computationally hard below a certain threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the computational complexity of evaluating local observables in PEPS is crucial for determining their practicality in quantum simulations and condensed matter physics.

Method: The authors employ a mathematical approach, analyzing the relationship between injectivity thresholds and contraction complexity.

Result: They identify a critical injectivity threshold; above which evaluation becomes efficient, below which it remains computationally hard.

Conclusion: This study provides a clear threshold for efficient computation when using injective PEPS, contributing to optimal algorithm design for tensor network calculations.

Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) constitute a variational family of
quantum states with area-law entanglement. PEPS are particularly relevant and
successful for studying ground states of spatially local Hamiltonians. However,
computing local expectation values in these states is known to be postBQP-hard.
Injective PEPS, where all constituent tensors fulfil an injectivity constraint,
are generally believed to be better behaved, because they are unique ground
states of spatially local Hamiltonians. In this work, we therefore examine how
the computational hardness of contraction depends on the injectivity. We
establish that below a constant positive injectivity threshold, evaluating
local observables remains postBQP-complete, while above a different constant
nontrivial threshold there exists an efficient classical algorithm for the
task. This resolves an open question from (Anshu et al., STOC `24).

Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a framework for approximating special

way that sets it apart from other classical or quantum approaches. We show that
the instances of MaxCut on which DQI attains a nontrivial asymptotic
approximation guarantee are solvable exactly in classical polynomial time. We
include a streamlined exposition of DQI tailored for MaxCut that relies on
elementary graph theory instead of coding theory to motivate and explain the
algorithm.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum compilers that reduce the number of T gates are essential for
minimizing the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation. To achieve
effective T-count reduction, it is necessary to identify equivalent circuit
transformation rules that are not yet utilized in existing tools. In this
paper, we rewrite any given Clifford+T circuit using a Clifford block followed
by a sequential Pauli-based computation, and introduce a nontrivial and
ancilla-free equivalent transformation rule, the multi-product commutation
relation (MCR). This rule constructs gate sequences based on specific
commutation properties among multi-Pauli operators, yielding seemingly
non-commutative instances that can be commuted. To evaluate whether existing
compilers account for this commutation rule, we create a benchmark circuit
dataset using quantum circuit unoptimization. This technique intentionally adds
redundancy to the circuit while keeping its equivalence. By leveraging the
known structure of the original circuit before unoptimization, this method
enables a quantitative evaluation of compiler performance by measuring how
closely the optimized circuit matches the original one. Our numerical
experiments reveal that the transformation rule based on MCR is not yet
incorporated into current compilers. This finding suggests an untapped
potential for further T-count reduction by integrating MCR-aware
transformations, paving the way for improvements in quantum compilers.

Abstract: In this work we consider a routing problem and compare quadratic and
higher-order representations using the Quantum Approximate Optimisation
Algorithm (QAOA). The majority of works investigating QAOA use quadratic
Hamiltonians to represent the considered problems, which can lead to poor
scaling in qubit requirements. We address the gap of direct comparisons between
quadratic and higher-order forms through an investigation into two distinct
formulations of the same use case. We find that the higher-order form yields
better solution quality and scales better in terms of numbers of qubits, but
requires more two-qubit gates. We additionally consider a factoring method to
reduce the gate depth of the higher-order version, which achieves a significant
reduction in the number of two-qubit gates when run on real IBM hardware.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the ergodic theorem for infinite-dimensional quantum
Markov semigroups, originally introduced by Frigerio and Verri in 1982, and its
latest version developed by Carbone and Girotti in 2021. We provide a
sufficient condition that ensures exponential convergence towards the positive
recurrent subspace, a well-known result for irreducible quantum Markov
semigroups in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Several illustrative examples
are presented to demonstrate the application of the ergodic theorem. Moreover,
we show that the positive recurrent subspace plays a crucial role in the study
of global asymptotic stability.

Abstract: This systematic review investigates the application of digital signal
processing (DSP) techniques -- originally developed for coherent optical
communication systems to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD).
The convergence of these domains has enabled significant advances in CV-QKD
performance, particularly in phase synchronization, polarization tracking, and
excess noise mitigation. To provide a comprehensive and reproducible synthesis
of this emerging field, we employed the APISSER methodology, a task-oriented
framework adapted from the PRISMA protocol. A structured search across IEEE
Xplore and Web of Science databases (2021-2025) yielded 220 relevant
publications, which were screened, classified, and analyzed to address six
research questions. Our findings highlight that many classical DSP algorithms,
such as Kalman filtering, carrier recovery, adaptive equalization, and
machine-learning-assisted signal estimation, have been successfully adapted to
the quantum regime, often requiring modifications to meet security and noise
constraints. We also identify a range of recent DSP innovations in coherent
optical communication systems with high potential for future CV-QKD
integration, including neural equalization, probabilistic shaping, and joint
retiming-equalization filters. Despite these advances, challenges remain in
achieving robust phase tracking under ultra-low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
conditions, real-time polarization compensation, and secure co-existence with
classical channels. This review maps current trends, technical barriers, and
emerging opportunities at the intersection of signal processing for quantum and
classical communication, supporting the development of scalable and resilient
CV-QKD systems.

Motivation: Understanding the Schwinger Model phase diagram is important for advancing QCD studies.

Method: We developed the NN-IQS model, which generates additional sample points in a continuous domain and generalizes beyond the training range.

Result: The NN-IQS model effectively predicts the phase diagram beyond its training range and maintains robust performance.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning in advancing theoretical physics research.

Abstract: The Schwinger Model from Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) has long served as a
valuable simplified model for exploring key physical phenomena in Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD)-a field rich with fundamental insights but is
substantially more complex. While the phase diagram of the Schwinger Model
bears extraordinary significance and remains challenging to investigate, recent
progress on the model mainly focuses on detailed case studies. Here, we propose
a model that we refer as the Neural Network Facilitated Implicit Quantum
Simulation (NN-IQS) model as a solution. After training on limited discrete
data points on the Schwinger Model phase diagram, the NN-IQS model allows quick
generation of extra sample points over a continuous domain. The model can even
generalize beyond its training range, maintaining robust performance in
previously unexplored parameter space and system sizes.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We give new dequantization and hardness results for estimating spectral sums
of matrices, such as the log-determinant. Recent quantum algorithms have
demonstrated that the logarithm of the determinant of sparse, well-conditioned,
positive matrices can be approximated to $\varepsilon$-relative accuracy in
time polylogarithmic in the dimension $N$, specifically in time
$\mathrm{poly}(\mathrm{log}(N), s, \kappa, 1/\varepsilon)$, where $s$ is the
sparsity and $\kappa$ the condition number of the input matrix. We provide a
simple dequantization of these techniques that preserves the polylogarithmic
dependence on the dimension. Our classical algorithm runs in time
$\mathrm{polylog}(N)\cdot s^{O(\sqrt{\kappa}\log \kappa/\varepsilon)}$ which
constitutes an exponential improvement over previous classical algorithms in
certain parameter regimes.
  We complement our classical upper bound with $\mathsf{DQC1}$-completeness
results for estimating specific spectral sums such as the trace of the inverse
and the trace of matrix powers for log-local Hamiltonians, with parameter
scalings analogous to those of known quantum algorithms. Assuming
$\mathsf{BPP}\subsetneq\mathsf{DQC1}$, this rules out classical algorithms with
the same scalings. It also resolves a main open problem of Cade and Montanaro
(TQC 2018) concerning the complexity of Schatten-$p$ norm estimation. We
further analyze a block-encoding input model, where instead of a classical
description of a sparse matrix, we are given a block-encoding of it. We show
$\mathsf{DQC}1$-completeness in a very general way in this model for estimating
$\mathrm{tr}[f(A)]$ whenever $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are sufficiently smooth.
  We conclude our work with $\mathsf{BQP}$-hardness and
$\mathsf{PP}$-completeness results for high-accuracy log-determinant
estimation.

Conclusion: 该研究展现了量子算法在复杂计算任务中的巨大潜力，尤其是在计算上下文深度方面。这对于量子计算的发展和应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Quantum contextuality is a limitation on deterministic hidden variable
models, testable in measurement scenarios where outcomes differ under quantum
or classical descriptions due to a common set of constraints. When considering
measurements of $N$-qubit spin operators, constraints arise from commutation
relations and classical bounds are determined by the $\textit{degree}$ of
contextuality, an NP-hard quantity to compute in general, related to the larger
class of optimisation problems known as $\texttt{MaxLin2}$. In this work we
give a quantum algorithm based on Grover's search algorithm, computing the
degree of contextuality in $O(\sqrt{n} \log\log{n})$ in $n$ states, a speedup
over classical brute force method. We also study variations of Grover which
encode the relevant information in the phases of the basis states, reducing
circuit width and depth requirements with indicative complexity of
$O(n^{\frac{1}{3}}(\log{n})^{2}\log\log{n})$. Testing on contemporary quantum
backends with the IBM quantum experience gives inconclusive outputs due to
noise-induced errors, an issue hopefully fixed by future hardware.

Abstract: We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems
undergoing a general physical process. These QSLs were obtained using two
families of entropic measures, namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon
divergence, which in turn defines a faithful distance of quantum states, and
the square root of the quantum Jeffreys divergence. The results apply to both
closed and open quantum systems, and are evaluated in terms of the Schatten
speed of the evolved state, as well as cost functions that depend on the
smallest and largest eigenvalues of both initial and instantaneous states of
the quantum system. To illustrate our findings, we focus on the unitary and
nonunitary dynamics of mixed single-qubit states. In the first case, we obtain
speed limits $\textit{\`{a} la}$ Mandelstam-Tamm that are inversely
proportional to the variance of the Hamiltonian driving the evolution. In the
second case, we set the nonunitary dynamics to be described by the noisy
operations: depolarizing channel, phase damping channel, and generalized
amplitude damping channel. We provide analytical results for the two entropic
measures, present numerical simulations to support our results on the speed
limits, comment on the tightness of the bounds, and provide a comparison with
previous QSLs. Our results may find applications in the study of quantum
thermodynamics, entropic uncertainty relations, and also complexity of
many-body systems.

Conclusion: 本研究展示了在高噪声环境中，通过改进的量子自测试方法，可以更有效地在实际量子设备中进行设备独立性验证。

Abstract: Self-testing is a key characteristic of certain nonlocal games, which allow
one to uniquely determine the underlying quantum state and measurement
operators used by the players, based solely on their observed input-output
correlations [MY04]. Motivated by the limitations of current quantum devices,
we study self-testing in the high-noise regime, where the two players are
restricted to sharing many copies of a noisy entangled state with an arbitrary
constant noise rate. In this setting, many existing self-tests fail to certify
any nontrivial structure. We first characterize the maximal winning
probabilities of the CHSH game [CHSH69], the Magic Square game [Mer90a], and
the 2-out-of-n CHSH game [CRSV18] as functions of the noise rate, under the
assumption that players use traceless observables. These results enable the
construction of device-independent protocols for estimating the noise rate.
Building on this analysis, we show that these three games--together with an
additional test enforcing the tracelessness of binary observables--can
self-test one, two, and n pairs of anticommuting Pauli operators, respectively.
These are the first known self-tests that are robust in the high-noise regime
and remain sound even when the players' measurements are noisy. Our proofs rely
on Sum-of-Squares (SoS) decompositions and Pauli analysis techniques developed
in the contexts of quantum proof systems and quantum learning theory.

TL;DR: Evolved developmental pathways in regulatory networks are organized in ways that make them both robust and prone to phenocopying, even after environmental perturbations outside their normal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how developmental systems balance robustness and phenocopying is crucial for fields like evolutionary biology and systems biology.

Method: The study used an abstract regulatory model and analyzed the effects of both small and large perturbations on developmental trajectories.

Result: Evolution simplifies high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes, allowing developmental pathways to be both robust and prone to phenocopying.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into the balance between robustness and phenocopying during evolution.

Abstract: Developmental trajectories are known to be canalized, or robust to both
environmental and genetic perturbations. However, even when these trajectories
are decanalized by an environmental perturbation outside of the range of
conditions to which they are robust, they often produce phenotypes similar to
known mutants called phenocopies. This correspondence between the effect of
environmental and genetic perturbations has received little theoretical
attention. Here, we study an abstract regulatory model which is evolved to
follow a specific trajectory. We then study the effect of both small and large
perturbations to the trajectory both by changing parameters and by perturbing
the state in a timed manner. We find, surprisingly, that the phenomenon of
phenocopying emerges in evolved trajectories even though the alternative
trajectories are not selected for. Our results suggest that evolution
simplifies the structure of high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes which can
simultaneously show robustness and phenocopying.

A model based on statistical mechanics captures these interactions through Monte Carlo simulations of cell populations in a 2D lattice. Each cell has fluxes for glucose consumption, respiration, and waste production/absorption. The system minimizes an energy function influenced by competitive (J_g > 0) and cooperative (J_w < 0) couplings between cells. The results reveal three phases: a competitive phase dominated by glucose competition, a cooperative phase marked by ordered waste exchange, and a disordered phase with local-scale cooperation. Evolutionary dynamics show how initially non-interacting cells can develop effective metabolic interactions, leading to heterogeneous cultures sustained by cross-feeding. Analytical solutions using mean-field approximations support these findings. The model provides insights into how environmental constraints and stochastic fluctuations shape community structures, offering a versatile approach to study several emergent phenomena in biological systems.

Motivation: Understanding the behavior of cell cultures and how they interact is crucial for advancing research in fields like microbiology, ecology, and synthetic biology. This paper presents a novel model using statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations to explore the complex dynamics of cell populations, offering valuable insights into the emergent properties of these systems.

Method: The study employs a computational modeling approach using Monte Carlo simulations on a 2D lattice of cells. Each cell is characterized by fluxes of three biochemical reactions, and the interactions between cells are governed by competitive and cooperative couplings. The model minimizes an energy function using these couplings, and evolutionary dynamics are incorporated to study the development of metabolic interactions over time.

Result: The model identifies three distinct phases in cell populations: a competitive phase dominated by glucose competition, a cooperative phase marked by ordered waste exchange, and a disordered phase with local-scale cooperation. The incorporation of evolutionary dynamics reveals that initially non-interacting cells can develop effective metabolic interactions, leading to the formation of cross-feeding relationships and the emergence of heterogeneous cultures. Analytical solutions using mean-field approximations support these findings, providing a robust framework for understanding the complex interactions within cell populations.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamic interactions within cell cultures using statistical mechanics and computational modeling. The identification of three distinct phases and the demonstration of how metabolic interactions evolve over time offer new insights into the emergent properties of biological systems. This approach has the potential to be applied to other complex systems, opening up new avenues for research in various fields.

Abstract: Cell cultures exhibit rich and complex behaviors driven by dynamic metabolic
interactions among cells. In this work, we present a model that captures these
interactions through a framework inspired by statistical mechanics. Using Monte
Carlo simulations, we explore the equilibrium and dynamical properties of a
population of cells arranged in a two-dimensional lattice, where each cell is
characterized by fluxes of three reactions: glucose consumption ($g$),
respiration ($r$), and waste production/absorption ($w$). The system minimizes
an energy function influenced by competitive ($J_g > 0$) and cooperative ($J_w
< 0$) couplings between cells. Our results reveal three distinct phases: a
competitive phase dominated by glucose competition, a cooperative phase marked
by ordered waste exchange, and a disordered phase with local-scale cooperation.
By incorporating evolutionary dynamics, we demonstrate how initially
non-interacting cells can develop effective metabolic interactions, leading to
heterogeneous cultures sustained by cross-feeding. These findings are further
supported by analytical solutions derived using mean-field approximations. The
model provides insights into how environmental constraints and stochastic
fluctuations shape community structures, offering a versatile approach to study
several emergent phenomena in biological systems.

Abstract: We extend a recently developed three-dimensional semiclassical model to study
double and triple ionization of Ne driven by infrared laser pulses at various
intensities. This model fully accounts for the Coulomb singularity of each
electron with the core, as well as for the interaction of a recolliding
electron with a bound electron. The model avoids artificial autoionization by
employing effective Coulomb potentials to describe the interaction between
bound electrons. Using the extended effective-Coulomb-potential for bound-bound
electrons (ECBB) model, we compute triple and double ionization spectra. For
instance, we compute the distributions of the sum of the final momenta along
the laser field of the escaping electrons. Taking focal volume averaging into
account, we find very good agreement with experimental results, particularly
for triple ionization. Also, we identify the main pathways of triple and double
ionization and explain how these pathways give rise to the main features of the
triple and double ionization spectra.

Abstract: The contradiction of micro-reversibility and macro-irreversibility is an old
problem in statistical mechanics. This article argues that irreversibility is
present even at the micro level because of the mechanical-electromagnetic
