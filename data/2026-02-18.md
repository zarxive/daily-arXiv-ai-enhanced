### [1] [May Negative Mass Objects exist in the sky?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15058)
*Shin'ichi Nojiri,S. D. Odintsov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究中推测了负质量物体（NMOs）可能存在，并展示了它们在常见理论框架下的可行性，探讨了其在光和粒子轨道中的行为，以及正负质量物体结合的可能性及其实际观测的潜在途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关于负质量物体的物理性质及其是否存在，一直是理论物理和天体物理学中的一个重要问题。通过构建有效的理论模型和分析，可以更深入地理解其潜在的观测可能性。

Method: 研究采用了经典引力理论框架，结合爱因斯坦场方程和弦理论-inspired扩展理论，如两个标量场理论和标量爱因斯坦-高斯-博内重力理论。通过求解这些方程组，得到了包含负质量物体的系统解，并通过分析光和粒子的运动轨迹来验证其物理行为。

Result: 负质量物体的存在可能与标准引力方程的解相一致，特别是当系统包含正质量物体、宇宙流和负的宇宙常数时。研究发现，正负质量物体可以形成稳定的束缚系统，其中正质量物体受到排斥力的作用。此外，还探讨了更复杂的非零质量物体的性质。

Conclusion: 负质量物体的研究为理解更复杂的引力系统和暗物质机制提供了新视角。尽管目前尚处于理论阶段，但这些发现为未来的观测提供了科学依据，尤其是对于大型望远镜和宇宙探测器而言，探索这种极端物体的存在具有重要意义。

Abstract: We conjecture the possibility of negative mass objects (NMOs) existing in the sky. It is shown that they may not be so exotic as usually expected. We show that NMOs appear as solutions of standard gravitational equations if we consider the system of a compact positive mass object, cosmological fluid and negative cosmological constant. We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties.

### [2] [Horizon-Brightened Acceleration Radiation and Optical Signatures of Generic Regular Black Holes from Nonlinear Electrodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15077)
*Uktamjon Uktamov,Ali Övgün,Reggie C. Pantig,Bobomurat Ahmedov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures for regular black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics. They examine the thermodynamics properties, photon-sphere location, and shadow size using specific spacetimes as examples. They also analyze quantum effects near the event horizon and derive radiation properties like entropy and a Wien-type displacement law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of black holes and their radiation characteristics under nonlinear electrodynamics is crucial for advancing theoretical astrophysics and testing quantum gravity effects.

Method: The authors use a combination of analytical and numerical methods, employing static, spherically symmetric spacetimes and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for parameter inference.

Result: Key findings include a detailed characterization of the photon sphere and shadow size, quantum radiation behavior near the horizon, and derived relations like the HBAR entropy-energy spectrum and Wien-type displacement law.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding HBAR radiation and its implications for regular black holes and quantum astrophysics.

Abstract: We investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures for a broad class of regular black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics. The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation.

### [3] [Black-hole thermodynamics in doubly special relativity: local-frame MDRs and rainbow metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15216)
*Abdelmalek Boumali*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the extension of modified dispersion relations within the framework of doubly special relativity to curved spacetimes and black holes, concluding similar Hawking temperatures across different approaches when using a consistent energy scale. The study also discusses discrepancies and the implications for quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the applicability of DSR principles in curved spacetimes and understanding Hawking temperature corrections in black holes.

Method: A comparative analysis of three extension methods and application of black-hole thermodynamics to evaluate Hawking temperatures under different energy scales and spacetime frameworks.

Result: Consistent Hawking temperature expressions emerge from energy-independent and energy-dependent approaches under a common scale choice, with corrections becoming negligible for macroscopic black holes.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that despite varying approaches, similar Hawking temperatures result, highlighting the robustness of DSR modifications in black hole thermodynamics and suggesting future research directions in quantum gravity.

Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) deforms special-relativistic kinematics while preserving the relativity principle by introducing a second invariant scale, typically the Planck energy $E_{\rm Pl}$. Extending DSR-inspired modified dispersion relations (MDRs) to curved spacetimes is challenging, as ambiguous definitions of the deformation energy risk reintroducing preferred frames.
  We review three common extensions beyond flat spacetime: (i) MDRs in local orthonormal frames on fixed backgrounds, (ii) phase-space/Hamiltonian geometry with relative locality, and (iii) rainbow metrics. Using black-hole thermodynamics for static spherically symmetric horizons, we compare two implementations: (A) energy-independent background with local-frame MDR, and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metric.
  When the same prescription is used for the deformation energy scale $E_\star$, both approaches yield identical Hawking temperatures: \begin{equation} T(E_\star)=T_0\,\frac{g(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}{f(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}\,,\qquad T_0=\frac{κ_0}{2π}\,, \end{equation} where $κ_0$ is the classical surface gravity.
  This $g/f$ scaling holds for examples such as Amelino--Camelia-type MDRs (leading correction $\propto E p^2/E_{\rm Pl}$, giving $T(E_\star)\simeq T_0(1-\fracη{2}E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})$ for $η>0$) and the Magueijo--Smolin invariant ($f=g$, so $T(E_\star)=T_0$).
  Further DSR effects on evaporation (thresholds, phase space, greybody factors, composition laws) are discussed. Discrepancies in the literature arise mainly from different choices of $E_\star$ (energy at infinity vs.\ local frame). For macroscopic black holes, corrections are suppressed by $T_0/E_{\rm Pl}$ and become relevant only near the Planck regime, where full quantum gravity dominates.

### [4] [Investigation of the gravitational dust collapse of the LQG-inspired effective asymmetric bounce model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15227)
*Kristina Giesel,Hongguang Liu,Eric Rullit*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The abstract discusses gravitational dust collapse in a model inspired by loop quantum gravity with an asymmetric bounce, analyzing singularity resolution and trapped surface formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is to understand gravitational collapse and singularity resolution in quantum gravity frameworks, particularly focusing on asymmetric bounces.

Method: The authors used a combination of analytical and numerical methods to examine the model, focusing on singularity resolution and trapped surface dynamics.

Result: The study found that the central singularity is resolved in the model, and during the bounce phase, a shell-crossing singularity appears as a polymerized vacuum region forms. Additionally, a critical mass threshold for horizons exists in the pre-bounce phase but not in the post-bounce phase.

Conclusion: This work contributes to understanding quantum gravitational effects on dust collapse, highlighting differences in dynamics before and after the bounce phase regarding singularity formation.

Abstract: We investigate gravitational dust collapse within an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG)-inspired model exhibiting an asymmetric bounce in the marginally bound case. This work extends previous studies, which have predominantly focused on models with either symmetric bounces or asymmetric bounces restricted to homogeneous dust configurations. Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate quantum and classical signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter halo. Starting from the exact spherically symmetric solution describing this composite system, we analyze particle production for both bosonic and fermionic fields using semiclassical techniques. Hawking radiation is derived through Bogoliubov transformations and independently via the tunneling method with energy conservation, allowing us to identify the effective temperature, emission spectrum, and the role of dark matter parameters in suppressing particle creation. The evaporation process is examined in the high-frequency regime, leading to modified evaporation times and emission rates relative to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We further study absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves employing a partial-wave analysis, computing phase shifts, partial and total cross sections, and assessing the impact of the Hernquist scale radius and density on these observables. Finally, null and timelike geodesics are explored to characterize light propagation and particle motion in the presence of the dark matter halo.

Conclusion: 总的来说，该论文对非转扭子类型 D 黑洞类的解进行了详细的分析，展示了这些解在不同外场条件下的多样性和复杂性。

Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the non-twisting subcase of the large class of type D black holes with a non-aligned electromagnetic field, presented recently in [H. Ovcharenko and J. Podolsky, Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 064076]. We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\mathrm{AdS}_2\times\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $Φ_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work. We also show the explicit relation to solutions previously found by Van den Bergh and Carminati, and we discuss the connection to the Alekseev-Garcia and Alexeev solutions.

### [7] [A fresh look at boundary terms in Einstein-Hilbert gravity via an initial value variational principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15469)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A key tenet of general relativity is the dynamical nature of space-time, ideally represented as an initial value problem. Here we explore the variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity as initial value problem by constructing its Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action, including a careful treatment of boundary terms. The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations.

### [8] [On the Limitations of Karmarkar's Condition in Static, Conformally Flat Spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15486)
*Samstuti Chanda,Ranjan Sharma,Sunil D. Maharaj*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A static, spherically symmetric spacetime with vanishing Weyl tensor and Karmarkar's condition must be conformally flat and belong to embedding class-I solutions, which are either the Schwarzschild interior or de Sitter spacetime. Pressure anisotropy and complexity factor vanish, and these solutions only depend on the imposed geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding geometric constraints on spacetime solutions, such as Schwarzschild and de Sitter models, is crucial for exploring fundamental aspects of general relativity and their implications in astrophysics, particularly in the context of stellar models and cosmology.

Method: The analysis employs the combined use of general relativistic principles, including exact solutions derivation and curvature constraints, focusing on conformal flatness and Karmarkar's condition.

Result: The spacetime solutions are uniquely determined as conformally flat with embedding class-I, and the examination of physical properties within these solutions leads to the vanishing of pressure anisotropy and complexity factor, highlighting their simplicity yet significance.

Conclusion: While the derivation is based solely on geometric constraints, it restricts the physical properties significantly, suggesting that additional factors may be necessary for developing realistic stellar models and cosmological applications using similar methods.

Abstract: For a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate the class of exact solutions that arise when two fundamental geometric constraints are imposed simultaneously: the Karmarkar's condition and the vanishing of the Weyl tensor. These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials.

Abstract: Displacement memory, induced by a wave pulse in a regular black hole spacetime, is studied using geodesic (timelike) separation and geodesic deviation. The presence of the wave pulse in such a black hole is modeled via a function $H(u)$ appearing in a restricted version of a generic Bondi-Sachs type line element. Choosing a sech-squared profile for $H(u)$, we first study (numerically) geodesic separation and geodesic deviation in a flat background. Thereafter, similar investigations are carried out in the presence of the black hole, but in regions far away from the vicinity of the horizon. Our results suggest the presence of a distinct displacement memory effect, which depends on the value of the regularisation parameter $g$ as well as the pulse height. Between different types of regular black holes, one notices parameter-dependent changes in the net displacement memory. Further, a clear difference in the magnitude of displacement memory (at large $u$) in regular and singular black holes is also visible in our numerical results.

Motivation: 研究黑洞的量子修正效应及其对黑洞热力学和动力学性质的影响，特别是在不同质量黑色洞中的表现。

Result: 量子修正项显著影响了QPO位置、ISCO分离；量子引力效应影响了量子扰动势和引力吸收概率；热力学修正项对小质量黑洞更重要，在较大数量级时退化为标准Bekenstein-Hawking定律。

Conclusion: 量子修正参数对黑洞的动力学和热力学性质有可观测影响，可通过QPO观测约束该参数。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $ζ$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $ζ$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.

The first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr formula are explicitly verified. Furthermore, we study the thermodynamic criticality of the system by deriving the critical points and examining the effects of the space-time geometric parameters. We also obtain the inversion temperature and demonstrate that the minimum inversion temperature is modified by the space-time parameters. In addition, the sparsity of Hawking radiation and thermal fluctuations of the system are investigated, highlighting the effects of the parameters on the entropy corrections. Finally, we analyze the optical properties of the black hole, in particular the photon sphere and shadow radius, showing how these parameters influence these features.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics and gravitational-wave signatures of periodic orbits of spinning test particles moving in the equatorial plane around static, spherically symmetric black holes within the framework of Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity. Based on the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, combined with the Tulczyjew spin supplementary condition, we derive the orbital dynamic equations for spinning particles moving in the equatorial plane and impose a timelike constraint to exclude unphysical superluminal trajectories. By comparing with the classical Schwarzschild black hole, we systematically analyze the effects of the nonlocal gravitational parameters $ζ$ and $b$ on the effective potential governing the radial motion of particles and the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, gravitational waveforms exhibit significant phase differences: an increase in $ζ$ induces a phase delay, whereas an increase in $b$ results in a phase advance. A one-year simulation of the orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral demonstrates that when $b=2$ and $ζ\approx10^{-6}$, the mismatch between the gravitational waveforms predicted for the nonlocal gravity black hole and those for the Schwarzschild black hole reaches the distinguishable threshold ($\mathcal{M}=0.0125$), providing a basis for observational discrimination between general relativity and nonlocal gravity.

Abstract: The ingoing and outgoing null expansions associated to a spatial 2-sphere are quantized in the spherically symmetric model of loop quantum gravity. It is shown that the resulting expansion operators are self-adjoint in the kinematical Hilbert space with generalized eigenstates. It turns out that the outgoing and ingoing expansion operators share the common continuous part of their spectra but have different additional isolated eigenvalues. These results provide new insights on the avoidance of the singularities in classical general relativity and the establishment of certain notion of quantum horizons.

Abstract: We establish results on the dynamics of interacting charged null fluids in general relativity, specifically in the context of the bouncing continuation proposed in [Ori91]. In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $γ$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordström spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{μν})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordström and Vaidya regions. Across $\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{μν}\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.

Abstract: We consider the Polyakov loop correlator in the confining phase of large $N$ Yang-Mills theory in three and four dimensions. It can be computed by summing over the exchange of closed flux tubes winding around the thermal cycle. At short separations, the leading divergence is controlled by perturbation theory. Combining these two facts allows us to determine the asymptotic spectral density of string states contributing to the correlator. This sharply relates the weakly-coupled UV of the gauge theory to the dynamics of highly energetic flux tubes. Then, in a toy integrable setting, we explore how this can bound the scattering data of the Goldstone modes on top of a long string. We derive a bound on the asymptotic behavior of the reflection amplitude of Goldstones against the flux tube boundary sourced by the Polyakov line, and rule out an asymptotically linear phase shift for the S-matrix. Along the way, we discuss how causality can impose bounds on thermodynamic quantities, and show how the positivity of time delays follows from unitarity and analyticity of $2d$ massless elastic S-matrices. We include a review on reflection amplitudes, and their computation in the theory of long effective strings.

Abstract: Exact nonperturbative solutions to hermitian one-matrix models, their topological string duals, as well as their double-scaling limits to multicritical and minimal string theories, may be obtained via the use of resurgent transseries. These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches. In order to study these solutions globally across their phase diagrams, however, complete non-linear Stokes data is still needed -- which will be addressed in a complementary follow-up paper.

Abstract: We propose a loop-level generalization of the inverse string theory Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) kernel: the planar inverse KLT integrand. The integrand is defined constructively via a novel Berends-Giele-like recursion that exposes the inverse KLT kernel as the simplest toy model of a ``stringy amplitude''. We show that, to all loop orders, the inverse KLT integrand is structurally equivalent to integrands in the cubic scalar tr$φ^3$ theory. This simplicity is obscured in the conventional Feynman diagram approach, where the inverse KLT integrand receives contributions from an infinity of infinite towers of contact interactions. The inverse KLT integrand is a rational function of stringified kinematic variables and is naturally defined on the kinematic surface proposed by Arkani-Hamed et al.. It provides an elementary analogue of the surfacehedron integrand for the tr$φ^3$ theory involving only scalar resonances and unifies the scattering of cubic scalars and pions in the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) to all loop orders via kinematic $α'$-shifts.

Motivation: The paper aims to address fundamental issues in semiclassical gravity by exploring modifications to the holographic dictionary, with the goal of providing a unified framework for resolving inconsistencies.

Method: The authors employ a systematic approach by modifying the holographic dictionary and constructing an extended semiclassical gravitational path integral that addresses factorization, entropy computation, and incorporates new operators.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates potential to resolve three key inconsistencies in a unified manner while maintaining foundational aspects of semiclassical gravity.

Conclusion: The paper presents a promising direction for reconciling inconsistencies in semiclassical gravity through modifications to the holographic dictionary and construction of an extended gravitational path integral.

Abstract: We review three well known inconsistencies in the standard mathematical formulation of semiclassical gravity: the factorization problem, the information problem, and the closed universe problem. Building upon recent work, we explore how modifying the holographic dictionary may provide the necessary freedom to resolve these three problems in a unified manner while maintaining more well established aspects of the standard correspondence. Using the modified holographic dictionary as a scaffolding, we propose a program for constructing an `extended' semiclassical gravitational path integral which (i) is manifestly factorizing, (ii) computes a von Neumann entropy which satisfies the Page curve, and (iii) incorporates new operators that create closed baby universe states. Our construction may be interpreted as imposing a semiclassical version of background independence/a no global symmetry condition, defining a modified large N limit, preparing an ensemble of dual theories, or enforcing observer rules using gravitational degrees of freedom.

Abstract: We demonstrate that modern machine-learning methods can autonomously reconstruct several flagship analytic structures in scattering amplitudes directly from numerical on-shell data. In particular, we show that the Kawai--Lewellen--Tye (KLT) relations can be rediscovered using symbolic regression applied to colour-ordered Yang--Mills amplitudes with Mandelstam invariants as input features. Using standard feature-selection techniques, specifically column-pivoted QR factorisation, we simultaneously recover the Kleiss--Kuijf and Bern--Carrasco--Johansson (BCJ) relations, identifying a minimal basis of partial amplitudes without any group-theoretic input. We obtain the tree-level KLT relations with high numerical accuracy up to five external legs, using only minimal theoretical priors, and we comment on the obstacles to generalising the method to higher multiplicity. Our results establish symbolic regression as a practical tool for exploring the analytic structure of the scattering-amplitude landscape, and suggests a general data-driven strategy for uncovering hidden relations in general theories. For comparison, we benchmark this general approach with a recently introduced neural-network based method.

Abstract: Non-topological solitons, such as Q-balls, may contribute to the cosmological dark matter. The formation and evolution of Q-balls in the early universe requires an understanding of solitons with nonzero angular momentum. We derive (rather than assume) the schematic form of the scalar field configurations that produce rotating Q-balls, which produce their well known quantized angular momentum. This analysis leads to additional insight into the properties of these rotating solitons, including a method for computing their characteristic angular velocity. By considering rotating solitons in two spatial dimensions, we investigate these attributes concretely. We develop analytical approximations for the solitons and their defining quantities. We show that they agree with numerical results and exhibit the general properties of rotating solitons.

Abstract: Or should we talk about dS/CFT correspondence or dS/SFT correspondence in cosmological correlators? In non-unitary field theories -- which are conjectured to be dual to cosmological correlators -- scale invariance does not necessarily imply full conformal invariance. While general relativity predicts the emergence of conformal invariance (or boost symmetry in the bulk), various modified theories of gravity suggest only scale invariance, characterized by the absence of bulk boost symmetry. We demonstrate this distinction using Einstein-Aether theory as a canonical example.

Motivation: Compact boson stars are interesting objects in theoretical physics, and understanding their properties in CP^N models with higher-order derivatives is crucial for exploring new phenomena.

Method: The authors use analytical and numerical methods to derive the necessary conditions for solutions and analyze the E(Q) relationship in an extended Skyrme-Faddeev model with quartic derivative terms.

Result: The model supports finite-energy solutions despite Derrick's scaling argument, and the quartic terms affect the energy-charge scaling, offering new insights into the stabilization of compact structures.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the understanding of compact solutions in higher-derivative models, opening new avenues for exploring compact boson stars in particle physics and cosmology.

Abstract: While $CP^N$ models with analytic potentials are known to support finite-energy compact Q-ball and Q-shell solutions, their behavior in more complex Lagrangian frameworks remains a subject of active research. This work explores these non-topological structures within an extended Skyrme-Faddeev-type model that incorporates quartic derivative terms. In this context, harmonic time dependence and the presence of quartic terms constitute two independent stabilization mechanisms that allow the configurations to circumvent Derrick's scaling argument. We investigate the necessary conditions for the existence of these solutions and analyze the influence of quartic terms on the properties of the resulting compactons, specifically examining the $E(Q)$ relationship between energy and Noether charge. Our findings provide valuable insights into the stability and characteristics of compact boson stars within $CP^N$ models featuring higher-order derivative terms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the contributions of Hawking radiation and the Schwinger mechanism in black hole physics is crucial for clarifying the origin of black hole entropy and verifying the no-hair theorem.

Method: The paper employs the island formula and heat kernel methods to compute entanglement entropy from both effects in near-extremal RN black holes. A brick wall model and Pauli-Villars regularization are also used for comparative analysis.

Result: The two particle emission mechanisms can be distinguished by their unique entanglement signatures in the context of near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes following the Page time.

Conclusion: This study provides a novel method to differentiate between Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, offering deeper insights into black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity.

Abstract: A charged black hole can emit charged particles via two independent mechanisms: the Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, which are intertwined in the radiation spectrum. In this paper, we will show that the two effects can be distinguished by analyzing the entanglement entropy carried by the produced particle pairs. Explicitly, we apply the island formula to the near extremal Reissner-Nordstr{ö}m (RN) black hole to calculate the total entanglement entropy of the radiation. Meanwhile we use the heat kernel method to calculate the entanglement entropy of charged particle pairs produced solely from the Schwinger effect. By comparing with the total entanglement entropy, we obtain the entanglement entropy produced purely from the Hawking radiation. Consequently, the two effects are distinguishable in near extremal RN black holes after the Page time. Furthermore, we also employ the brick wall model and the Pauli-Villars regularization to derive the entanglement entropy from the Schwinger effect, which gives a slightly different result with that obtained from the heat kernel method.

Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for three-dimensional quantum Hall fluids of extended objects (quasi-strings) in the presence of a strong three-form background field associated with a bundle gerbe. In the strong-field regime, fast internal dynamics is frozen and the low-energy kinematics is governed by generalized guiding-center variables consisting of vectorial and tensorial coordinates. We show that these guiding-center variables obey a noncommutative geometry giving rise to a three-dimensional generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra for projected density operators. Moreover, we relate this algebra to the canonical quantization of a topological BF+BB theory whose level is identified with the Dixmier-Douady invariant. Our results clarify the structure of incompressible quantum Hall-type phases and their geometric and topological features in three spatial dimensions.

Abstract: The required absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity has been used to imply that all non-compact gauge theories are in the swampland. This argument stems from the idea that non-compact gauge symmetries always seem to be accompanied by global symmetries that cannot be broken with a finite number of fields. In this work, we investigate whether these symmetries can be broken by an uncountable infinity of fields. We find that the symmetries can be broken, but as soon as we add these fields the EFT breaks down and in some cases decompactifies to a higher-dimensional theory without the non-compact gauge symmetry, akin to undoing a Kaluza-Klein reduction on a non-compact space. We make various comments on the species scale, free parameters, and the Weak Gravity Conjecture along the way.

The topological analysis independently confirms the existence of critical points and classifies the system within the universal topological scheme for black hole thermodynamics.

Motivation: The pursuit of precise wave control through complex media, enabled by advanced technologies, leads to the challenge of achieving full transmission control, which is addressed in this work.

Method: Multi-scattering-based approach using generalized Wigner-Smith operators and experimental demonstration in an acoustic waveguide, showing non-Abelian characteristics and extending to arbitrary unitary operations.

Result: Exhibition of reflectionless transmission with unitary matrices, braiding of waveguide modes, and applicability to other wave types with potential use cases in advanced technologies.

Conclusion: Pioneering method for multi-scattering-based wave control, expanding the potential for various wave manipulations in future applications.

Abstract: Multiple scattering of waves in complex media can be harnessed and tailored for diverse phenomena in sound and light. Despite the tremendous progress enabled by technologies such as time-reversal propagation and wavefront shaping, the full control of transmission matrix remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a multi-scattering-based approach to design reflectionless complex media with a unitary transmission matrix of arbitrary structures. As such, the perfect transmission of waves through such a medium performs a unitary operation. Based on this principle, we experimentally demonstrated braiding of multiple waveguide modes in an acoustic waveguide via multiple scattering and showed non-Abelian characteristics arising from the concatenation of distinct complex media. Furthermore, we show that the principle can be extended for realizing arbitrary unitary operations beyond braiding. Our scheme uses generalized Wigner-Smith operators to design the optimal acoustic complex media with near-arbitrary targeted functionalities. The scheme is generally applicable beyond acoustics, with broad implications to other wave types. Our results demonstrate unprecedented control over multiple-scattering waves and are relevant to applications that require precise control over propagation, such as multiplexed communications, wave-based logic operations, and computations.

Using symmetry considerations, the researchers identified key properties of band splitting, such as the symmetry of spin distribution in electron bands, the symmetry of bands in external magnetic fields, and the dependence of quantum oscillation frequencies and amplitudes on the magnetic field.

Conclusion: The symmetry-based approach allows for a general understanding of band splitting in altermagnets like CrSb, which is essential for predicting and designing new materials with tailored magnetic properties.

Abstract: Altermegnets are a class of metallic magnets characterized by spin-split electron bands. Band splitting in the hexagonal altermagnet CrSb was studied using the ARPES method, magnetotransport and torque measurements, combined with DFT+U calculations. The shape, position, and even symmetry of the Fermi surfaces found in these studies vary. The developed approach, based on symmetry considerations, allows us to establish several general properties of band splitting in the altermagnet CrSb, including the symmetry of the spin distribution in each electron band, the symmetry of the bands in an external magnetic field, and the dependence of the frequencies and amplitudes of quantum oscillations on the magnetic field.

Abstract: We compute universal electrical transport near continuous transitions between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a metallic phase in moire Chern bands, focusing on fillings $ν=-1/2$ and $ν=-3/4$. The critical theory represents a novel QED-Chern-Simons framework: a charged sector at a bosonic Laughlin-superfluid critical point is coupled, via emergent gauge fields and Chern-Simons mixing, to a neutral spinon Fermi surface. Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$. Gauge-mediated inelastic scattering removes the collisionless Drude singularity and produces a universal scaling function $Σ(ω/T)$ and finite DC conductivities $σ(0) \approx 0.033 e^2/\hbar$ ($ν=-1/2$) and $0.047 e^2/\hbar$ ($ν=-3/4$). We also identify a Chern-Simons "filtering" mechanism that suppresses transmission of Landau damping from the spinon Fermi surface to the critical gauge mode. Our approach provides concrete transport diagnostics for detecting quantum criticality in moire superlattices.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the electronic structure of Ba4Ir3O10 using DFT and spin-polarized Dirac muffin-tin orbitals with GGA+U. The material has a quasi-2D structure with buckled sheets and corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers. The Ir atoms are split into two sites (Ir1 and Ir2) due to the trimer geometry. The Ir1-Ir2 distance is small, leading to strong bonding and antibonding states at Ir1, but a large energy gap is observed only at Ir2 due to strong Coulomb correlations. RIXS experiments show sharp features from transitions involving t2g levels and a wide feature from charge transfer, consistent with theoretical calculations.

Motivation: Understanding the electronic properties of unconventional materials like iron-based superconductors and transition metal oxides is crucial for advancing material science and condensed matter physics. This study contributes to this understanding by examining the electronic structure of Ba4Ir3O10, a promising compound for such investigations.

Method: The study employs a combined theoretical approach using DFT with GGA+U correction in a fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac muffin-tin orbital framework to analyze the electronic structure of Ba4Ir3O10.

Result: The key findings include the identification of strong bonding and antibonding states at different Ir sites, the emergence of a significant energy gap due to strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site, and the experimental confirmation of RIXS features through comparison with theoretical calculations.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive electronic structure analysis of Ba4Ir3O10, highlighting the importance of Ir site-specific correlations in determining its electronic properties, and validates the theoretical framework for studying similar materials.

Abstract: We have investigated the electronic structure of Ba4Ir3O10 within the density-functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations (GGA+U) in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. Ba4Ir3O10 has a quasi-2D structure composed of buckled sheets, which constitute corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers containing three distorted face-sharing IrO6 octahedra. The Ir atoms are distributed over two symmetrically inequivalent sites: the center of the trimer (Ir1) and its two tips (Ir2). The Ir1 - Ir2 distance within the trimer is quite small and equals to 2.58 A at low temperature. As a result, the clear formation of bonding and antibonding states at the Ir1 site occurs. The large bonding-antibonding splitting stabilizes the dyz-orbital-dominant antibonding state of t2g holes and produces a wide energy gap at the Fermi level. However, the energy gap opens up only with taking into account strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site. Therefore, we have quite a unique situation when the insulating state is driven by both the dimerization at the Ir1 site and Mott insulating behavior at the Ir2 one. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum possesses several sharp features below 2.1 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitation located from 2.1 to 4.6 eV is due to t2g to eg and O2p to t2g transitions. The wide structure situated at 6.2-12 eV appears due to charge transfer and O2p to eg transitions. We have also presented comprehensive theoretical calculations of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge.

TL;DR: The paper investigates topological phase transitions in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moire heterobilayers under a perpendicular electric field. Upon increasing displacement field, the system undergoes two consecutive electric-field-driven topological phase transitions: first, a Mott insulator becomes a spin-polarized quantum anomalous Hall Mott insulator, and then an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator with a critical metallic state at an intermediate field. At high fields, a Chern insulating transport response reappears after a critical field transition. The platform provides a tunable realization of an extended Kane-Mele-Hubbard model hosting sequential correlation-topology-intertwined transitions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between symmetry breaking, topological order, and strong correlations in 2D materials is crucial for advancing condensed matter physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. This work addresses the challenging realization of consecutive topological phase transitions, which have been theoretically predicted but rarely experimentally observed.

Method: Angle-aligned two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichromate (TMDC) monolayers were stacked on WS2 to create a moire pattern. The researchers studied their evolution under an out-of-plane electric field using layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements.

Result: The experimental results reveal two consecutive electric-field-driven topological phase transitions. The first transition leads to a spin-polarized quantum anomalous Hall Mott insulator, and the second transition results in an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator. At an intermediate field strength, a critical metallic state emerges, and beyond a critical field, a Chern insulating transport response is observed.

Conclusion: The work demonstrate the existence of two consecutive topological phase transitions in a tunable platform, providing a comprehensive understanding of the correlation-topology interplay in 2D materials and advancing the research on topological phases of matter.

Abstract: Consecutive topological phase transitions (TPTs) between strongly correlated electronic phases that differ simultaneously in symmetry breaking and topological order are of fundamental interest in condensed matter physics, yet are rarely realized experimentally. We report two consecutive electric-field-driven TPTs at half filling (nu = 1) in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moire heterobilayers. With increasing out-of-plane displacement field, a geometrically frustrated Mott insulator evolves into a ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) Mott insulator, i.e., a spin-polarized topological Mott insulator without an observable charge-gap closure, and subsequently into an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator (VC-AFM) accompanied by a continuous charge-gap collapse and the emergence of a critical metallic state. Layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements jointly determine the phase diagram. The high-field evolution of the antiferromagnetic state reveals a metamagnetic-like transition at a critical field B*, above which a Chern insulating transport response reappears. Our results establish the MoTe2/WSe2 moire platform as a tunable realization of an extended Kane-Mele-Hubbard model hosting sequential correlation-topology-intertwined transitions.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the electronic structure of Co-intercalated 2H-TaS₂ using ARPES. While the main bands resemble those of pristine TaS₂, a
β-feature


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key motivation of this study was to investigate the electronic properties of Co-intercalated 2H-Tellurium disulfide (TaS₂) using Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES). The study focuses on understanding the electronic structure by examining the main electronic bands, a new β-feature, and the surface vs bulk origin of this feature.

Method: The researchers used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the electronic structure of Coᵢ₃ TaS₂ and Co₀.₂₂ TaS₂. For a detailed analysis, especially concerning strong electron correlations, they employed Cluster Perturbation Theory (CPT). Cluster Perturbation Theory is a computational method used to go beyond the limitations of typical density functional theory (DFT) calculations by providing an exact treatment of strong electron correlations in the system.

Result: The study identifies a shallow electron pocket, referred to as the β-feature, at the Fermi level near the corner of the superlattice Brillouin zone. This β-feature cannot be reproduced with standard DFT calculations but is observed in Co₁/₃ TaS₂. The researchers employed CPT to account for strong electron correlations on cobalt sites beyond the DFT+U approximation. In an underdoped sample, Co₀.₂₂ TaS₂, the β-feature is absent, and its electronic structure closely resembles that of undoped 2H-TaS₂. This suggests that the β-feature is of bulk origin and arises from strong electronic correlations influenced by both the cobalt charge state and long-range crystallographic order.

Conclusion: The researchers conclude that the β-feature in Co₁/₃ TaS₂ originates from bulk electronic correlations that involve the cobalt charge state and long-range crystallographic order. This work highlights the importance of accurately treating electron correlations when studying intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: We investigated the electronic structure of Co-intercalated 2H-TaS$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In the compound Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, the main electronic bands closely resemble those of pristine 2H-TaS$_2$, with no clear signs of band folding. However, a shallow electron pocket, referred to as the $β$-feature, was detected at the Fermi level near the corner of the superlattice Brillouin zone. The surface vs bulk origin of this feature is debated, as it cannot be reproduced using standard DFT calculations. To resolve this, we employed cluster perturbation theory (CPT) to incorporating an exact treatment of strong electron correlations (U) on the cobalt sites, going beyond DFT+U approximation. To further substantiate this, we studied an underdoped sample, Co$_{0.22}$TaS$_2$, where a reduced charge transfer leads to different Co orbital character near the Fermi level. We find that its electronic structure closely resembles that of undoped 2H-TaS$_2$, and crucially, lacks the $β$-feature. Our results demonstrate that the $β$-feature is of the bulk origin emerging from the strong electronic correlations where both the Co charge state and long-range crystallographic order play an important role. This work highlights the need for accurate treatment of electron correlations when studying intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: We report an x-ray photoemission spectroscopy study of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ surface-dosed with Cs alkali atoms and C$_{60}$ molecules. Due to its small ionization energy (large electron affinity), deposited Cs atoms (C$_{60}$ molecules) are expected to provide a solid surface with electrons (holes). Upon dosing the dopants to Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we found a new Ru $3d$ photoemission peak emerging on the lower binding-energy side, suggesting the creation of a core-hole screening channel associated with coherent Ru $4d$ states around the Fermi level. For both the Cs and C$_{60}$ dosing, this change occurred without an appreciable chemical potential jump. The coherent state, therefore, develops within the Mott gap through hybridization with the impurity level of the dopants. The present work highlights the flexibility of Mott-insulator surfaces as a playground for metal-insulator transitions.

TL;DR: gLPFET is an extension of LPFET that combines gKS-DFT with DMET, allowing for accurate descriptions of electron correlation in various regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) in different correlation regimes by combining it with density matrix embedding theory (DMET).

Method: gLPFET introduces generalized embedding clusters designed from a full-size gKS system, where the Hartree-Fock exchange potential is combined with a local correlation potential optimized to match the global and local densities.

Result: Numerical calculations show that gLPFET maintains high accuracy in strongly correlated systems and fixes the flaw of LPFET in weaker correlation regimes.

Conclusion: gLPFET enhances the capabilities of DFT by bridging the gap between the exact formalism of DFT and the localized nature of DMET.

Abstract: In this work we introduce a generalized flavor, in the sense of generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory (gKS-DFT), of the recently derived local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET) [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 20, 10293], where the in-principle exact formalism of DFT is combined with that of density matrix embedding theory (DMET). In generalized LPFET (gLPFET), the embedding clusters are designed from a full-size gKS system where the (in-principle non-local) Hartree-Fock exchange potential is combined with a local (in the localized orbital representation) correlation potential. The latter is optimized self-consistently such that gKS and local embedding cluster's densities match. Unlike in DMET, which uses the same (global) chemical potential value in all clusters, each embedded orbital has its own chemical potential in gLPFET. We show analytically that, when electron correlation is strongly local, the latter potential becomes a simple functional of the correlation potential. Numerical calculations on model systems confirm the high accuracy of gLPFET in this regime, in contrast to DMET. Moreover, we show that gLPFET completely fixes the flaw of LPFET in weaker correlation regimes, through its appropriate description of the Hartree-exchange potential.

Abstract: Emergent gauge fields and Coulomb liquids have long been central to the physics of frustrated pyrochlore magnets, yet their realization beyond conventional, i.e. rank-1 $U(1)$, spin ice and into fully quantum higher-rank regimes has remained elusive. Here we provide a controlled demonstration of this physics in the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the breathing pyrochlore lattice with symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions, using the pseudofermion functional renormalization group. We show that tuning the breathing asymmetry stabilizes extended quantum analogues of both rank-1 and rank-2 $U(1)$ Coulomb liquids within a single microscopic model, directly distinguished by their characteristic pinch-point morphologies in momentum space. This provides the first controlled quantum realization in three dimensions where gauge theories of different rank emerge within a single microscopic spin Hamiltonian. In addition, quantum fluctuations qualitatively reshape the classical nearest-neighbor atlas of phases, causing an incommensurate spiral instability and an extended quantum-disordered regime without dipolar order, both absent from the classical model. Our results establish the breathing pyrochlore as a timely and experimentally relevant platform where higher-rank gauge constraints, conventional magnetic order, and fluctuation-driven quantum phases compete on equal footing, opening a direct route to diagnosing emergent gauge structure in three-dimensional quantum magnets.

Abstract: We propose a minimal tight-binding model for the electronic interface layer of the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure with oxygen vacancies. In this model, the effective carriers are subject to oxygen vacancy induced magnetic impurities. Both the effects of random on-site potentials and Zeeman-like exchange interactions between correlated carriers and magnetic impurities are taken into account. By applying the combined coherent potential approximation (CPA) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for a ferromagnetic state, we uncover a disordered Fermi-liquid regime for the majority-spins and a low energy scale which controls the transport of the minority-spin carriers, both induced by the magnetic impurities.

TL;DR: Micro-calorimetry is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and function of biological systems by measuring heat changes during process to compute heat capacity. This involves nonequilibrium calorimetry concepts and computational models of biophysical systems such as ciliates and molecular motors, revealing complex dependencies including negative heat capacity values due to biological activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of biological systems at a fundamental level often requires advanced quantitative methods. Micro-calorimetry provides a unique approach to probe the thermodynamic properties of these systems by measuring heat changes during their operation, which can reveal insights into their structure and function that are not accessible through other means.

Method: The study uses nonequilibrium calorimetry, which involves measuring heat changes in a system that is not in thermal equilibrium. The researchers developed computational models of biophysical systems, such as ciliates and molecular motors, to calculate the heat capacity of these systems under different conditions. The models take into account the nonequilibrium nature of the systems and use mathematical tools to analyze the heat capacity as a function of various parameters.

Result: The key findings of the study include the quantitative prediction of dependencies of heat capacity on relevant biological parameters. Interestingly, the study found that heat capacity can take negative values, which is attributed to active biological processes. These findings provide new insights into the functioning of biological systems and validate the use of nonequilibrium calorimetry as a powerful tool for studying such systems.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of micro-calorimetry as a valuable tool for understanding the thermodynamic properties of biological systems. By applying nonequilibrium calorimetry, the researchers were able to compute heat capacity for biophysical models related to ciliary motion and molecular motor motion. The results, including the possibility of negative heat capacity values, highlight the importance of considering biological activity in thermodynamic analysis.

Abstract: Micro-calorimetry offers significant potential as a quantitative method for studying the structure and function of biological systems, for instance, by probing the excess heat released by cellular or sub-cellular structures, isothermal or not, when external parameters change. We present the conceptual framework of nonequilibrium calorimetry, and as illustrations, we compute the heat capacity of biophysical models with few degrees of freedom related to ciliar motion (rowing model) and molecular motor motion (flashing ratchets). Our quantitative predictions reveal intriguing dependencies of the (nonequilibrium) heat capacity as a function of relevant biophysical parameters, which can even take negative values as a result of biological activity.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，超螺旋 metamaterials 中的强空间色散显著影响了辐射特性，在工程应用中可据此设计具有特定辐射特性的 metamaterial 设备。

Abstract: The theory of transition radiation in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion is developed in the framework of an effective field theory approach. The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion. Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and the anomalous Doppler effect in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion are described.

Abstract: The emergence of optical circular dichroism in chiral nanoscale and molecular systems provides not only a way for analyzing the sample chirality itself but also additional degrees of freedom in manipulating light. Such manipulation can be reached even at the nanoscale level; however, probing and understanding the properties of optical fields well below the diffraction limit requires an adequate technique. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based electron state sorting has been suggested as a suitable candidate, but to date, no conclusive experiments have been performed. We, therefore, theoretically explore the emergence of dichroism in EELS for a canonical single-twist helix nanostructure and present a detailed analysis of the optimal parameters to obtain a robust signal. Our work offers novel insights into the interpretation and volatility of the OAM-resolved EELS signal, which can inspire and guide future experimental efforts.

Abstract: A precision measurement of the photoionization of pure sodium and potassium nanoparticles isolated in a beam enabled an accurate determination of their work functions as a function of temperature. In addition to resolving and quantifying the initial gradual decrease of the work function with temperature, which is associated with thermal expansion, the experiment revealed that the work function then undergoes a distinct drop both in magnitude and in slope that signifies the onset of nanoparticle melting. This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold. The melting temperature of nanoparticles with diameters of 7-9 nm is reduced by nearly 100 K relative to the bulk value. This suppression aligns with predictions from the Gibbs-Thomson equation which describes finite-size phase transitions.

Abstract: We show how the micro-focused BLS signal of forward volume spin waves is formed and why it remains observable despite symmetry-based "suppression" expectations. A reciprocity-theorem based model with vectorial diffraction-limited focusing identifies the nonnegligible longitudinal focal-field component as the key element responsible for BLS sensitivity in the forward volume geometry. We further demonstrate that full polarization analysis, implemented through polarizer-analyzer maps of coherently excited spin waves, provides information beyond the conventional crossed polarizer-analyzer readout. In a BiYIG thin film, the measured maps exhibit Stokes/anti-Stokes polarization asymmetries and nontrivial patterns that stem from quadratic magneto-optical coupling terms. Fitting the data with a model including Voigt and Cotton-Mouton contributions yields an effective Cotton-Mouton constant and shows that the quadratic response is comparable to the linear Voigt contribution.

Abstract: The work functions of 7Li and 6Li metals have been measured as a function of temperature, by using photoionization of pure isolated metal nanoparticles in a beam. These data reveal a marked isotope effect in the temperature variation of these work functions. Furthermore, for both isotopes the curvature of this temperature variation is found to be significantly larger than may be ascribed purely to a change in the electron gas density. These findings enhance the characterization of lithium as a quantum material in which the interplay between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom is nontrivial, and call for a microscopic understanding beyond simple models. Additionally, the slope of the work function curves was observed to vanish in the low temperature limit, as had been predicted on the basis of the Third Law of thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uniformity in the excitonic spectrum is a key requirement for accessing intrinsic excitonic physics in two-dimensional semiconductors; however, in supported transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, exciton energies and linewidths can vary spatially due to inhomogeneities created by contact with other materials or contamination left by fabrication procedures. Suspended TMD monolayers provide an effective route to minimizing substrate-induced disorder. Here we demonstrate the spatially uniform excitonic spectrum from high-quality WSe2 suspended monolayers fabricated by gold-assisted exfoliation directly onto an Au contact electrode of a gate-tunable device. The resulting membranes span narrow suspended regions up to ~80 um and show spatially uniform photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures with neutral-exciton linewidths as low as ~4.5 meV, comparable to the narrowest values reported for high-quality monolayers. Spectral reproducibility across the suspended regions supports an intrinsic optical response, while gate-dependent measurements resolve multiple excitonic species. This approach provides a practical route to electrically tunable potential landscapes in suspended TMD monolayers with a highly uniform excitonic response.

Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of nonlinear magneto-optical injection currents in multi-Weyl semimetals subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Using the Landau-level spectrum of a tilted multi-Weyl Hamiltonian with arbitrary monopole charge $ν$ as a starting point, we formulate a Kubo-type nonlinear response theory in the Landau-level basis and derive the second-order conductivity tensor. We identify distinct contributions originating from chiral-chiral, chiral-bulk, and bulk-bulk optical transitions, revealing characteristic monopole-charge scaling and sharp resonant structures governed by Landau-level selection rules and tilt-induced asymmetry. In the untilted limit, closed-form analytical expressions emerge that expose universal frequency thresholds and provide clear experimental signatures of higher-order Weyl topology. Our results establish nonlinear magneto-optical injection currents as a direct transport probe of chiral Landau levels and multi-Weyl topological charge.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A universal energy eigenvalue equation is proposed in this paper. It is proven that the unique set of eigenfunctions or preferred basis exists for any non-isolated sub-system. Applying the new eigenvalue equation to the relative motion of a hydrogen atom together with the derived relativistic Hamiltonian to quantify the impact of finite proton mass to the fine structure, correction to the fine structure is obtained as a result of the entanglement of the relative motion and the center-of-mass motion, which can be used to verify the correctness of the proposed eigenvalue equation. Applying the equation to the measurement of electron double-slit interference, it is analyzed that the photon packets with Lorentzian spectral lineshape, the domain and state density of the sub-system, and the energy of the incident electron together determines the spontaneous emission rate of the incident electron. Photons generated in this process excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the detector. Corresponding to any emitted or absorbed photon, the sub-system is found to be uniquely determined by maximizing the transition rate. This new principle is valid for atoms too. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the transition rates and example numerical results show good correlation between calculation and the position measurement experiment. The discovered common mechanisms that determine the sub-systems, the preferred bases, and transition rates form the foundation of a new, general, and consistent theory of quantum measurement.

Abstract: This chapter introduces and investigates some fundamental questions on the relationship between accuracy and robustness in both classical and quantum classification algorithms under noisy and adversarial conditions. We introduce and clarify various definitions of robustness and accuracy, including corrupted-instance robustness accuracy and prediction-change robustness, distinguishing them from conventional accuracy and robustness measures. Through theoretical analysis and toy models, we establish conditions under which trade-offs between accuracy and robustness accuracy arise and identify scenarios where such trade-offs can be avoided. The framework developed highlights the nuanced interplay between model bias, noise characteristics, and perturbation types, including relevant and irrelevant perturbations. We explore the implications of some of these results for incompatible noise, adversarial quantum perturbations, the no free lunch theorem, and suggest future methods to examine these problems from the lens of dynamical systems.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the geometry of quantum logic gates within the holomorphic representation of quantum mechanics. We begin by embedding the physical qubit subspace into the space of holomorphic functions that are homogeneous of degree one in each Schwinger boson pair $(z_{a_{j}}, z_{b_{j}})$. Within this framework, we derive explicit closed-form differential operator representations for a universal set of quantum gates--including the Pauli operators, Hadamard, CNOT, CZ, and SWAP--and demonstrate that they preserve the physical subspace exactly. Restricting to unit-magnitude variables ($|z| = 1$) reveals a toroidal space $\mathbb{T}^{2N}$, on which quantum gates act as canonical transformations: Pauli operators generate Hamiltonian flows, the Hadamard gate induces a nonlinear automorphism, and entangling gates produce correlated diffeomorphisms that couple distinct toroidal factors. Beyond the torus, the full Segal--Bargmann space carries a natural Kaehler geometry that governs amplitude dynamics. Entanglement is geometrically characterized via the Segre embedding into complex projective space, while topological protection arises from the $U(1)^{N}$ fiber bundle structure associated with the Jordan--Schwinger constraint.

Abstract: Recent results from the Large Hadron Collider have demonstrated quantum entanglement of top quark-antiquark pairs using the spin degree of freedom. Based on the doubly differential measurement of the spin density matrix of the top quark and antiquark performed by the CMS collaboration in the helicity and beam bases, we evaluate a set of quantum observables, including discord, steering, Bell correlation, and magic. These observables allow for a quantitative characterization of the quantum correlations present in a top quark--antiquark system, thus enabling an interpretation of collider data in terms of quantum states and their properties. Discord is observed to be greater than zero with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations ($σ$). Evidence for steering is found with a significance of more than 3$σ$. This is the first evidence for steering, and the first observation of discord in a high-energy system. No Bell correlation is observed within the currently probed phase space, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These results experimentally corroborate the full hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quarks with discord being the most basic form of quantum correlation, followed by entanglement, steering and Bell correlation. The significance of nonzero magic, which is a complementary observable to the quantum-correlation hierarchy, is found to exceed 5$σ$ in several regions of phase space.

Conclusion: 非可稳定化性是一个强大的量子计算资源，在许多体量子系统中捕捉临界性和局部扰动。文中开发的SRE工具为理解量子多体系统的涌现属性提供了新方法。

Abstract: While nonstabilizerness (''magic'') is a key resource for universal quantum computation, its behavior in many-body quantum systems, especially near criticality, remains poorly understood. We develop a spectral transfer-matrix framework for the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) in infinite matrix product states, showing that its spectrum contains universal subleading information. In particular, we identify an SRE correlation length -- distinct from the standard correlation length -- which diverges at continuous phase transitions and governs the spatial response of the SRE to local perturbations. We derive exact SRE expressions for the bond dimension $χ=2$ MPS ''skeleton'' of the cluster-Ising model, and we numerically probe its universal scaling along the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ critical lines in the phase diagram. These results demonstrate that nonstabilizerness captures signatures of criticality and local perturbations, providing a new lens on the interplay between computational resources and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states, specifically biphoton frequency combs, which offer a significant improvement in transmission rate compared to previous protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to enhance the efficiency and applicability of quantum communication by leveraging high-dimensional entanglement resources, with a particular focus on practical implementation using current technology.

Method: The method employed in this paper involves the use of biphoton frequency combs, which are examples of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. The protocol discretizes the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom by encoding information through time-frequency displacements. A key aspect of this approach is the exploitation of the large Hilbert space inherent in quantum frequency combs to achieve higher transmission rates while maintaining resilience against errors. Additionally, the paper outlines an experimental implementation utilizing standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors, and a frequency beamsplitter. The authors also analyze the impact of experimental noise and errors on the protocol's channel capacity.

Result: The proposed protocol demonstrates a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors) for realistic experimental parameters. This represents more than a doubling of the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme. Furthermore, it surpasses the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by a factor of 4.6. The results highlight the potential of time-frequency grid states in advancing continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information processing. The experimental feasibility of the protocol is supported by the authors' analysis of optical loss and noise resilience.

Conclusion: This paper constitutes a significant step forward in the development of practical and high-capacity entanglement-assisted communication schemes. The utilization of biphoton frequency combs not only enhances the transmission rate but also paves the way for future research in high-dimensional quantum information applications. The protocol's experimental implementation using existing components suggests that it could soon become a reality in the field of quantum communication technology.

Abstract: Superdense coding, the application of entanglement to boost classical communication capacity, is a cornerstone of quantum communication. In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom and encoding information by time-frequency displacements. This approach leverages the inherently large Hilbert space found in quantum frequency combs, with resilience against both temporal and spectral errors. In addition to describing the theoretical structure of the protocol, we propose an experimental implementation using standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors and a frequency beamsplitter. We also analyze the effect of experimental noise and errors on the channel capacity of the protocol. We demonstrate that for realistic experimental parameters, contemporary technologies satisfy the prerequisites for superdense coding with biphoton frequency combs, achieving a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per transmitted photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors). This more than doubles the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme, while also having competitive optical loss. Furthermore, our results beat the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by 4.6 times. Our protocol thus represents an experimentally feasible application of time-frequency grid states to entanglement-assisted communication, contributing to the active fields of continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information.

Abstract: We present a novel waveguide design that incorporates a split-diode structure, allowing independent electrical control of transition energies of multiple emitters over a wide range with minimal loss in waveguide coupling efficiency. We use this design to systematically map out the transition from superradiant to independent emission from two quantum dots. We perform both lifetime as well as Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurements on the device, observing anti-dips in the photon coincidences indicating collective emission while at the same time observing a drop in lifetime around zero detuning, indicating superradiant behaviour. Performing both measurement types allows us to investigate detuning regions which show both superradiant rate enhancement and inter-emitter coherence, as well as regions in which correlations persist in the absence of rate enhancement.

Abstract: We present a photon-pair source in commercially available optical fiber that produces paired photons at telecommunication and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The highly nondegenerate pairs are 700 nm apart: one in the 1500 nm E- and S-band telecommunication range and the other in the 830 nm NIR range. The high non-degeneracy means the photon pairs are far-detuned from Raman noise, resulting in a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio even while operating at room temperature. The source produces two spectrally and spatially distinct phase-matched processes with low spectral cross-talk, distinct transverse spatial modes in the NIR, and a single fundamental spatial mode in the telecommunication range. The source's room-temperature operation, off-the-shelf materials, and multiplexing potential make it promising for deployment in quantum networks.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how to convert abstract quantum algorithms into executable quantum gates, facing the problem of exponential growth in the search space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, but translating high-level quantum algorithms into executable gates remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and exponential growth of the search space.

Method: The paper proposes a method that combines supervised learning with stochastic beam search to approximate the minimum description length of residual unitaries. This approach uses a lightweight model with zero-shot generalization to reduce training overhead.

Result: The method achieves faster wall-clock synthesis times compared to prior baselines and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rates for complex circuits.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in automating quantum algorithm compilation, offering both speed improvements and enhanced success rates in synthesizing quantum circuits.

Abstract: Quantum unitary synthesis addresses the problem of translating abstract quantum algorithms into sequences of hardware-executable quantum gates. Solving this task exactly is infeasible in general due to the exponential growth of the underlying combinatorial search space. Existing approaches suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, substantial training costs and limited generalization across different qubit counts. We mitigate these limitations by using supervised learning to approximate the minimum description length of residual unitaries and combining this estimate with stochastic beam search to identify near optimal gate sequences. Our method relies on a lightweight model with zero-shot generalization, substantially reducing training overhead compared to prior baselines. Across multiple benchmarks, we achieve faster wall-clock synthesis times while exceeding state-of-the-art methods in terms of success rate for complex circuits.

Conclusion: 扩展集群-ising模型提供了一种在量子体系中实现超越预期充电能力的案例，尽管这在特定条件下是不可能的。

Abstract: Quantum batteries, miniaturized devices able to store and release energy on demand, are promising both because their intrinsic energy and time scales can match those of other quantum technologies and due to the intriguing possibility of achieving super-extensive charging power. While this enhanced scaling is known to appear in several settings, it is generally believed to be forbidden in Wigner-Jordan integrable spin chains charged via quantum-quench protocols. Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit. This phenomenon appears robust against finite-temperature effects.

Result: 所有的有限幂零群对称性的MPS类都会在允许对称测量和前馈后退化为同一相。成功概率在热力学极限下收敛于1，这意味着这种转化是确定性的。对于非正规的带有长程相关性的MPS，如GHZ类态，结论同样成立。

Conclusion: 通过对称测量和前馈，所有有限幂零群对称性的MPS类都会退化为同一相，研究结果揭示了对称性在量子相分类中的重要性，特别是对于幂零群对称性的情况。该方法通过层次化的不可约表示结构实现了对非交换组件的递归分解，归约到交换组件，从而实现了完整的相退化。该研究表明，对称测量对于各种有限幂零对称性量子态的相分类具有决定性影响。

Abstract: We classify phases of one-dimensional matrix-product states (MPS) under symmetric circuits augmented with symmetric measurements and feedforward. Building on the framework introduced in Gunn et al., Phys. Rev. B 111, 115110 (2025), we extend the analysis from abelian and class-2 nilpotent groups to all finite nilpotent groups. For any such symmetry group $G$, we construct explicit protocols composed of $G$-symmetric circuits and measurements with feedforward that transform symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states into the trivial phase and vice versa using a finite number of measurement rounds determined by the nilpotency class of $G$. Although these transformations are approximate, we prove that their success probability converges to unity in the thermodynamic limit, establishing asymptotically deterministic equivalence. Consequently, all SPT phases protected by finite nilpotent groups collapse to a single phase once symmetric measurements and feedforward are allowed. We further show that the same holds for non-normal MPS with long-range correlations, including GHZ-type states. The central technical ingredient is a hierarchical structure of irreducible representations of nilpotent groups, which enables a recursive reduction of non-abelian components to abelian ones. Our results demonstrate that symmetric measurements lead to a complete collapse of both symmetry-protected and non-normal MPS phases for all finite nilpotent symmetry groups.

Abstract: The recent demonstrations of cascaded PDC (CPDC) and the hopeful prospects of realizing third-order PDC (TOPDC) for the generation of three-photon entangled states are paving the way for experimental studies on genuine three-photon interference. In this article, we formulate three-photon interference in terms of ``each three-photon interfering only with itself.'' We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent parameters. The first parameter is the three-photon path-length difference, which has a direct analog in the one-photon and two-photon cases, and the other two parameters quantify the path-asymmetry length. Unlike two-photon interference, which requires only one parameter to quantify path-asymmetry, two independent parameters are needed in three-photon interference. This results in a broader class of nonclassical three-photon effects, including three-photon HOM-type effects. Our work provides the theoretical basis for existing and future three-photon interference experiments exploring the rich and complex quantum correlations associated with three-particle entanglement and potentially enabling the development of novel protocols for harnessing those correlations.

Abstract: We digitally simulate quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved backgrounds using 80 superconducting qubits on IBM Heron processors. By engineering spatially varying couplings in the spin-$\frac12$ XXZ chain, consistent with the low energy description of the model in terms of an inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, we realize excitations that follow geodesics of an effective metric inherited from the underlying spatial deformation. Following quenches from Néel and few-spin-flip states, we observe curved light-cone propagation, horizon-induced freezing in the local magnetization, and position-dependent oscillation frequencies set by the engineered spatial deformation. Despite strong spatial inhomogeneity, unequal-time correlators reveal ballistic quasiparticle propagation in the spin chain. These results establish large-scale digital quantum processors as a flexible platform for detailed and controlled exploration of many-body dynamics in tunable and synthetic curved spacetimes.

For dimension $N$ and error $ε$, the number of quantum gates in our circuits is polynomial in $\log(N)$ and $\log(1/ε)$. Our construction relies on the Jordan-Schwinger representation, which allows us to realize irreps of $SU(n)$ in the Hilbert space of $n$ quantum harmonic oscillators. Together with a recent efficient quantum Hermite transform, which allows us to map the computational basis states to the eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator, this allows us to implement these irreps efficiently. Our quantum circuits can be used to construct explicit Ramanujan quantum expanders, a longstanding open problem. They can also be used to fast-forward the evolution of certain quantum systems.

Abstract: Energy consumption is becoming a serious bottleneck for integrating quantum technologies within the existing global information infrastructure. In photonic architectures, considerable energy overheads stem from using lasers, whose high coherence was long considered indispensable for quantum state preparation. Here, we demonstrate that natural, incoherent sunlight can successfully produce quantum-entangled states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We detect polarization-entangled photon pairs with a concurrence of $0.905\pm0.053$ and a Bell state fidelity of $0.939\pm0.027$. Importantly, the system violates Bell's inequality with $S=2.5408\pm0.2171$, exceeding the classical threshold of 2, while maintaining generation rates comparable to laser-based setups. These findings pave the way for sustainable quantum applications in resource-limited environments like interplanetary missions.

Abstract: Protocols have been previously proposed to certify the presence of an entangled measurement in a fully device-independent manner. Here, I provide models for these protocols in which the claimed measurement is not entangled, and demonstrate it is always possible to displace entanglement from measurements to measured states for a general class of device-independent scenarios. This indicates that no black-box measurement scenario requires entangled measurements to replicate its behavior, which is relevant to our fundamental understanding of this phenomenon and how to witness it.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an open quantum battery that stores and releases energy by employing a two-mode ultrastrongly coupled bosonic system, with one mode (the charger) coupled to an independent heat reservoir. Our results demonstrate that both the charging energy and ergotropy of the quantum batteries can be significantly enhanced within the ultra-strong coupling regime and across a broader temperature range in transient time. A unidirectional energy flow is achieved by controlling the system's initial state through its two-mode squeezed ground state. Furthermore, we show that the steady-state stored energy, along with its corresponding ergotropy, can be enhanced at larger temperatures and stronger coupling strengths. Notably, a purely beam-splitter or two-mode squeezing interaction yields zero ergotropy. These findings indicate that the enhanced stored energy and ergotropy of the quantum battery arises principally from the combined effects of beam-splitter and parametric amplification (squeezing) couplings. In addition, the presence of the squared electromagnetic vector potential term can prevent a phase transition and achieve a significant charging energy and high ergotropy in the deep-strong coupling regime. The results presented herein enhance our understanding of the operating principles of open bosonic quantum batteries.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation requires minimizing non-Clifford gates, whose implementation via magic state distillation dominates the resource costs. While $T$-count minimization is well-studied, dedicated $CCZ$ factories shift the natural target to direct Toffoli minimization. We develop algebraic methods for this problem, building on a connection between Toffoli count and tensor decomposition over $\mathbb{F}_2$. On standard benchmarks, these methods match or improve all reported results for both Toffoli and $T$-count, with most circuits completing in under a minute on a single CPU instead of thousands of TPUs used by prior work.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the implementation of a universal gate set via double-braiding within SU(2)k anyon models. The explicit form of the double elementary braiding matrices (DEBMs) in these models are derived from the F-matrices and R-symbols obtained via the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2). Using these EBMs, standard single-qubit gates are synthesized up to a global phase by a Genetic Algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), achieving the accuracy required for fault-tolerant quantum computation with only 2-level decomposition. For two-qubit entangling gates, Genetic Algorithm (GA) yields braidwords of 30 braiding operations that approximate the local equivalence class [CNOT]. Theoretically, we demonstrate that performing double-braiding in a three-anyon (six-anyon) encoding of single-qubit (two-qubit) is topologically equivalent to a protocol requiring the physical manipulation of only one (three) anyons to execute arbitrary braids. Our numerical results provide strong evidence that double-braiding in SU(2)k anyons models is capable of universal quantum computation. Moreover, the proposed protocol offers a potential new strategy for significantly reducing the number of non-Abelian anyons that need to be physically manipulated in future braiding-based topological quantum computations (TQC).

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their high encoding rates and distances. However, implementing logical operations using qLDPC codes presents significant challenges. Previous research has demonstrated that self-dual qLDPC codes facilitate the implementation of transversal Clifford gates. Here we introduce a method for constructing self-dual qLDPC codes by stacking non-self-dual qLDPC codes. Leveraging this methodology, we develop double-chain bicycle codes, double-layer bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, double-layer twisted BB codes, and double-layer reflection codes, many of which exhibit favorable code parameters. Additionally, we conduct numerical calculations to assess the performance of these codes as quantum memory under the circuit-level noise model, revealing that the logical failure rate can be significantly reduced with high pseudo-thresholds.

Abstract: We propose a stochastic Schrödinger equation (SSE) approach to investigate the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to a waveguide, addressing two critical gaps in existing research, namely insufficient exploration on continuous coupling and multiple excitations. A key finding is that continuous coupling, unlike discrete coupling at finite points, breaks the constant phase difference condition, thereby weakening the interference effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. In addition, a key technical advantage of the SSE approach is that auto- and cross-correlation functions can directly reflect the complex photon emission/absorption processes and time-delay effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. Moreover, the SSE approach also naturally handles multiple excitations, without increasing equation complexity as the number of excitations grows. This feature enables the investigation of multi-excitation initial states of the waveguide, such as thermal and squeezed initial states. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to waveguide, particularly for continuous coupling and multi-excitation systems.

Abstract: In traditional research, chaos is frequently accompanied by non-linearity, which typically stems from non-linear interactions or external driving forces. However, in this paper, we present the chaotic behavior that is completely attributed to the non-linear back-reaction of non-Markovian environment. To be specific, we derive the dynamical equations of an optomechanical system and demonstrate that the non-linearity (cause of chaos) in the equations arises entirely from the time-domain convolutions (TDCs) induced by non-Markovian corrections. Under Markovian conditions, these TDCs are reduced into constants, thereby losing the nonlinearity and ultimately leading to the disappearance of chaos. Furthermore, we also observe chaos generation in the absence of optomechanical couplings, which further confirms that the non-Markovian effect is the sole inducement of chaos and the environmental parameters play important roles in the generation of chaos. We hope these results may open a new direction to investigate chaotic dynamics purely caused by non-Markovian environments.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the Schrödinger cat state transfer in a quantum optical version of Newton's cradle in non-Markovian environment. Based on a non-Markovian master equation, we show that the cat state can be transferred purely through the memory effect of the non-Markovian common environment, even without any direct couplings between neighbor cavities. The mechanism of the environment induced cat state transfer is analyzed both analytically and numerically to demonstrate that the transfer is a unique phenomenon in non-Markovian regime. From this example, the non-Markovian environment is shown to be qualitatively different from the Markovian environment reflected by the finite versus zero residue coherence. Besides, we also show the influence of environmental parameters are crucial for the transfer. We hope the cat state transfer studied in this work may shed more light on the fundamental difference between non-Markovian and Markovian environments.

Abstract: We study the task of quantum state exclusion, focusing on antidistinguishability and its generalization to $x$-antidistinguishability, under global measurements and local operations with classical communication (LOCC). We also introduce weak and strong notions of antidistinguiahbaility ($x$-antidistinguishability) depending on whether all states or all $x$-tuples are exhaustively eliminated. Our results reveal striking differences between state exclusion and the more familiar task of state discrimination. In particular, we show that LOCC antidistinguishability of multipartite product states is symmetric with respect to the initiating party but this symmetry breaks down for higher-order $x$-antidistinguishability. Most notably, we establish a manifestation of \emph{nonlocality without entanglement} in the context of state exclusion: we prove that three bipartite product states can be globally antidistinguishable while failing to be LOCC antidistinguishable, demonstrating that three is the minimal number of states required for this phenomenon. We further extend this separation to $2$-antidistinguishability and present example exhibiting the same type of nonlocality. At last, we provide an antidistinguishable tripartite product states that are not LOCC antidistinguishable across any bipartition, which ensures the phenomenon of \emph{genuine nonlocality without entanglement} in this framework.

Abstract: We analyze numerically the performance of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) for statistical and financial problems. We use a reservoir composed of two superconducting islands coupled via their charge degrees of freedom. The key non-linear elements that provide the reservoir with rich and complex dynamics are the Josephson junctions that connect each island to the ground. We show that QRC implemented in this circuit can accurately classify complex probability distributions, including those with heavy tails, and identify regimes in correlated time series, such as periods of high volatility generated by standard econometric models. We find QRC to outperform some of the best classical methods when the amount of information is limited. This demonstrates its potential to be a noise-resilient quantum learning approach capable of tackling real-world problems within currently available superconducting platforms. We further discuss how to improve our QRC algorithm in real superconducting hardware to benefit from a much larger Hilbert space.

Abstract: Quantum architectures based on neutral atoms have gained significant attention in recent years as specialized computational machines due to their ability to directly encode the independent set constraint on graphs, exploiting the Rydberg blockade mechanism. In this work, we address the Drone Delivery Packing Problem via a hybrid quantum-classical framework leveraging a neutral-atom quantum processing unit (QPU). We reformulate the optimization task as a graph-partitioning problem based on the independent sets (ISs) of a scheduling graph that encodes delivery incompatibilities. Each partition corresponds to deliveries assigned to a single drone, with the objective of minimizing the total number of partitions. While the ISs represent time-feasible schedules, battery-duration constraints are enforced through a classical post-processing routine. This methodology enables the recovery of optimal delivery schedules, provided a sufficient number of samples is collected from the QPU to resolve the solution space. We benchmark the hybrid workflow through numerical emulations and demonstrate its effectiveness on Pasqal's Fresnel QPU, reporting hardware experiments with configurations of up to 100 atoms.

Abstract: Quantum correlations, crucial for the advantage and advancement of quantum science and technology, arise from the impossibility of expressing a quantum state as a tensor product over a given set of parties. In this work, a generalized notion of correlations via arbitrary products is formulated. Remarkably, as a universal property, the connection between such general products and tensor products is established, allowing one to relate generic non-product states to the common notion of entangled states. We construct the set of free operations for general types of products by extending the local-operation-and-classical-communication paradigm, familiar from standard entanglement theory, thereby establishing a resource theory of correlations for general products. A generalization is provided beyond two factors that can be universally related to multipartite entanglement. Applications that highlight the usefulness of the approach are discussed, such as the factorization of fermionic states, the non-local factorization of multi-photon states into single-photon states, and the interesting possibility of understanding prime numbers as a form of single-party entanglement.

Abstract: We present new distributed quantum algorithms for fundamental distributed computing problems, namely, leader election, broadcast, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Breadth-First Search (BFS) tree, in arbitrary networks. These algorithms are (essentially) optimal with respect to their communication (message) complexity in the {\em quantum routing model} introduced in [PODC 2025]. The message complexity of our algorithms is $\tilde{O}(n)$ for leader election, broadcast, and MST, and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{mn})$ for BFS ($n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes and edges of the network, respectively). These message bounds are nearly tight in the quantum routing model since we show almost matching corresponding quantum message lower bounds. Our results significantly improve on the prior work of [PODC 2025], who presented distributed quantum algorithms under the same model that had a message complexity of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{mn})$ for leader election.
  Our algorithms demonstrate the significant communication advantage that quantum routing has over classical in distributed computing, since $Ω(m)$ is a well-established classical message lower bound for leader election, broadcast, MST, and BFS that applies even to randomized Monte-Carlo algorithms [JACM 2015]. Thus, our quantum algorithms can, in general, give a quadratic advantage in the communication cost for these fundamental problems.
  A main technical tool we use to design our distributed algorithms is quantum walks based on electric networks. We posit a framework for using quantum walks in the distributed setting to design communication-efficient distributed quantum algorithms. Our framework can be used as a black box to significantly reduce communication costs and may be of independent interest. Additionally, our lower-bound technique for establishing distributed quantum message lower bounds can also be applied to other problems.

Abstract: We introduce a systematic framework for three-qubit entanglement classification using a cascaded architecture of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Leveraging the well defined three-qubit structure with the four nested entanglement classes (S, B, W, and GHZ), we construct three distinct witness models ($\mathcal{M}_{B}$, $\mathcal{M}_{W}$, and $\mathcal{M}_{GHZ}$) that sequentially discriminate between these classes. The proposed Cascaded model achieves an overall classification accuracy of $95\%$ on a comprehensive dataset of mixed states. The framework's robustness and generalization capabilities are confirmed through rigorous testing against out-of-distribution (OOD) entangled states and various quantum noise channels, where the model maintains high performance. A key contribution of this research is an optimization protocol based on systematic feature importance analysis. This approach yields a tunable framework that significantly reduces the number of required features, while maintaining reliable model accuracy.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanog gratings is established, accounting for self-generated magnetic fields. Simulations reveal that spin rotation via magnetic fields enables coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction, with potential applications in spintronics and quantum information processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study explores the unexplored area of controlled spin manipulation in electron diffraction from nanog gratings, targeting applications in spintronics and quantum information processing.

Method: A self-consistent Maxwell-Pauli framework is developed to study spin-resolved electron diffraction incorporating geometric confinement, image-charge effects, self-generated magnetic fields, and external fields. Numerical simulations are used to validate the theoretical model.

Result: The intrinsic magnetic self-field generated by electron spin is too weak to significantly alter spin states, but a uniform magnetic field can rotate electron spin states without disrupting diffraction. A non-uniform magnetic field can induce spin-dependent spatial shifts, useful for advanced spin control applications.

Conclusion: The findings provide a foundation for all-magnetic spin control of electron beams, opening new possibilities in spin-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: Electron diffraction from nanogratings provides a platform for free-electron interferometry, yet controlled manipulation of electron spin in such geometries remains largely unexplored. In particular, the role of the self-generated magnetic field arising from electron motion and the feasibility of coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction coherence have not been quantitatively investigated. In this article, a self-consistent Maxwell-Pauli framework is developed to study spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanogratings in the presence of magnetic fields. The model incorporates geometric confinement, image-charge interactions, self-generated magnetostatic fields, and externally applied magnetic fields. Numerical simulations show that the intrinsic magnetic self-field produced by the electron probability current is several orders of magnitude too weak to induce measurable spin mixing, demonstrating that nanogratings act as spin-conserving beam splitters under field-free conditions. When a uniform magnetic field is applied upstream of the nanograting, coherent Larmor precession enables controlled spin rotation without modifying the diffraction geometry or degrading coherence. The magnetic field required for a $π$ spin rotation scales inversely with the interaction length and electron de Broglie wavelength $λ_{dB}$. Furthermore, a downstream nonuniform magnetic field applied after the nanograting imparts a spatially varying Zeeman phase, producing opposite transverse momentum shifts for the two spin components. The spin-dependent transverse dynamics is analyzed using Husimi Q-function phase-space maps, which visualize spin-dependent population redistribution and momentum separation. The proposed approach enables tunable spatial separation of spin-resolved free electron beams and establishes an all-magnetic route for coherent spin rotation, control, and interferometry.

Abstract: Nonlinear phase gates are essential to achieve the universality of continuous-variable quantum processing and its applications. We present a deterministic protocol for generating nonlinear phase gates in trapped ion systems using simultaneous two-tone sideband drives beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime. Our approach harnesses higher-order interaction terms typically neglected or suppressed to construct nonlinear phase gates. This methodology enables high-fidelity gate engineering with a near three-fold reduction in control pulses compared to state-of-the-art theoretical proposals.

Abstract: We study correlation properties of polaritons at zero temperature in a multiconnected Jaynes--Cummings (MCJC) lattice on a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics platform with engineered cross-Kerr nonlinearity that mimics attractive nearest-neighbour interaction. A multi-connected Jaynes--Cummings lattice is a one-dimensional lattice constructed from alternating qubits and resonators with different left and right couplings. The nearest-neighbour interaction or cross-Kerr coupling is implemented dispersively through ladder-type qutrits between each nearest neighboring pair of resonator modes. Projecting onto the lower-polaritonic manifold, we derive an extended two-mode (bipartite) Bose--Hubbard-like model featuring on-site and attractive nearest-neighbor interactions. Employing a continuum bosonization approach, we express the Hamiltonian in terms of symmetric ($+$) and antisymmetric ($-$) collective modes. In the regime where the ($-$) sector acquires a finite gap, one can reduce the system to an effective single-component Luttinger liquid model for the $+$ sector. The cross-Kerr term reduces the compressibility of the ($+$) mode, thereby enhancing the corresponding Luttinger parameter $K_{+}$, resulting in the slower algebraic decay of single-particle correlations, $G(x)\propto|x|^{-1/(4K_{+})}$.

Abstract: Entanglement swapping between photon pairs generated at physically separated nodes over telecommunication fiber infrastructure is an essential step towards the quantum internet, enabling applications such as quantum repeaters, blind quantum computing, distributed quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. However, successful networked entanglement swapping relies on generating indistinguishable pairs of photons and preserving them over deployed fibers. This has limited most previous demonstrations to laboratory settings or relied on sophisticated methods to maintain the necessary indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable entanglement swapping experiment using naturally indistinguishable entanglement sources based on warm atomic vapor cells. Without sharing lasers or optical frequency references between nodes, nor the need for pulsing the sources, we achieve a swapping rate of nearly 500 pairs/s while maintaining the CHSH parameter above 2. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by maintaining the quality of the entanglement swapping on 17.6-km of deployed fibers in NYC, relying on commercially available SPADs at the spoke nodes, SNSPDs at the hub and standard time-synchronization techniques. Our work paves the way for the practical deployment of large-scale hub-and-spoke quantum networks within cities and data centers.

Motivation: Enables faster and more accurate quantum simulations by leveraging meta-learning.

Method: Combines VQE with LSTM-based meta-initialization using CUDAQ.

Result: Achieves near FCI accuracy in chemistry and efficient scaling in physics.

Conclusion: VQE-LSTM is a scalable quantum simulation tool bridging chemistry and physics.

Abstract: We explore the industrial and scientific applicability of the VQE-LSTM framework by integrating meta-learning with GPU accelerated quantum simulation using NVIDIA's CUDA-Q (CUDAQ) platform. This work demonstrates how an LSTM-FC meta-initialization module can extend the practical reach of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in both chemistry and physics domains. In the chemical regime, the framework predicts ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians derived from PySCF, achieving near FCI accuracy while maintaining favorable O(N^2) scaling with molecular size. In the physical counterpart, we applied the same model to quantized Simple Harmonic Motion systems (SHM), successfully reproducing its ground and excited states through VQE and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) methods. Benchmark results on NVIDIA GPUs reveal significant speedups over CPU-based implementations, validating CUDAQ's capability to handle large-scale variational workloads efficiently. Overall, this study establishes VQE-LSTM as a viable and scalable approach for GPU accelerated quantum simulation, bridging quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics through a unified, meta-learned initialization strategy.

TL;DR: steady-state coherence in a qubit can't coexist with being a quantum map


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understanding compatibility between steady-state coherence and quantum maps is essential for quantum system modeling

Method: compared Redfield and Lindblad equations to analyze coherence and quantum map properties

Result: Redfield allows invalid quantum states, whereas Lindblad maintains validity but prohibits coherence

Conclusion: coherence and quantum map properties are incompatible in steady-state systems

Abstract: We consider the issue of steady state coherences in a single qubit in the case of a composite system-bath interaction as proposed in \cite{Guarnieri18}. Based on a field theoretical approach we reanalyse the issue within a Redfield description. We find that the Redfield approach in accordance with \cite{Guarnieri18} yields steady state coherences but violating the properties of a quantum map also gives rise to negative populations. The issue is resolved by applying the Lindblad equation which is in accordance with a proper quantum map. The Lindblad equation, however, also implies the absence of steady state coherence. We conclude that steady state coherence in a a qubit is incompatible with a quantum map.

*Aabhas Gulati,Ion Nechita,Clément Pellegrini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper offers a mathematical framework for understanding the entanglement properties of Dicke states, a class of bosonic quantum states, dissecting separability, PPT, and entanglement witnesses through the lens of tensors and convex geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entanglement characterization in multipartite quantum systems is crucial but complex. This paper tackles it by focusing on Dicke states, using tensor-based methods to simplify analysis and bridge entanglement theory with algebraic geometry.

Method: The authors employ a tensor parametrization of Dicke states, translating entanglement properties into questions about symmetric tensors. They establish connections with convex cones (completely positive, copositive tensors) and use these to construct and analyze specific entangled states.

Result: Key outcomes include the identification of PPT entangled states in higher-dimensional systems, refutation of a conjecture about PPT entanglement in certain cases, and the development of semidefinite programming tools for separability testing in the Dicke subspace. These results enhance our ability to detect and understand quantum entanglement in complex systems.

Conclusion: The工作 provides essential tools for entanglement detection in multi-qudit systems, particularly Dicke states, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical verification methods in quantum physics.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete mathematical theory for the entanglement of mixtures of Dicke states. These quantum states form an important subclass of bosonic states arising in the study of indistinguishable particles. We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This dictionary maps separability to completely positive tensors, the PPT property to moment tensors, entanglement witnesses to copositive tensors, and decomposable witnesses to sum of squares tensors. Using this framework, we construct explicit PPT entangled states in three or more qutrits. In this class of states, we establish that PPT entanglement exists for all multipartite systems with three qutrits or more, disproving a recent conjecture in [J. Math. Phys. 66, 022203 (2025)]. We also show that, for mixtures of Dicke states, the PPT condition with respect to the most balanced bipartition implies PPT with respect to any other bipartition. We further connect bosonic extendibility of mixtures of Dicke states to the duals of known hierarchies for non-negative polynomials, such as the ones by Reznick and Polya. We thus provide semidefinite programming relaxations for separability and entanglement testing in the Dicke subspace.

Abstract: QwaveMPS is an open-source Python library for simulating one-dimensional quantum many-body waveguide systems using matrix product states (MPS). It provides a user-friendly interface for constructing, evolving, and analyzing quantum states and operators, facilitating studies in quantum physics and quantum information with waveguide QED systems. This approach enables efficient, scalable simulations by focusing computational resources on the most relevant parts of the quantum system. Thus, one can study a wide range of complex dynamical interactions, including time-delayed feedback effects in the non-Markovian regime and deeply non-linear systems, at a highly reduced computational cost compared to full Hilbert space approaches, making it both practical and convenient to model a variety of open waveguide-QED systems (in Markovian and non-Markovian regimes), treating quantized atoms and quantized photons on an equal footing.

Abstract: We incorporate a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) based low-level solver as a means to accelerate the environment-level solver for the recently developed MPCC embedding framework. Using CPD, we both factorize the three dominant order-three density-fitting two-electron integral (DF TEI) tensors and develop a novel formulation that reduces the storage complexity of the low-level solver from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(NR)$, where $R$ is the CPD rank, and the computational scaling of the most time-consuming contractions from $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(NR^2)$. We provide benchmarks on representative chemical environments, namely water clusters $\mathrm{(H_2O)_n}$ with $n = 1$ to $6$ and linear alkane chains $\mathrm{C_nH_{2n+2}}$ with $n = 1$ to $6$. For both test sets, using the CPD-compressed DF TEI tensors reproduces the DF reference convergence behavior of the low-level solver, the subsequent high-level step, and the fully self-consistent MPCC iterations, while introducing only small, rank-controlled shifts in absolute energies. At a fixed tolerance in the absolute MPCC energy, the CP ranks required for these tensor approximations increase linearly with system size. Chemically relevant energy differences are likewise preserved, as demonstrated for water-cluster dissociation energies and in a proof-of-concept embedding calculation of methane in a four-water cluster.

Abstract: Proton-conducting solid acids could enable water-free operation of high-temperature fuel cells. However, systematic materials screening has, hitherto, been computationally prohibitive. Here, we introduce a two-stage high-throughput screening strategy that directly computes proton diffusion coefficients, enabled by machine-learned interatomic potentials fine-tuned to ab initio data. Starting from more than six million materials, our screening -- based on structural motifs rather than empirical descriptors -- identifies $27$ high-performing proton conductors, including over ten previously unexplored compounds. These include sustainable and commercially available materials, candidates that have not yet been synthesized, organic systems that fall outside conventional design rules, and known proton conductors that validate our approach. Importantly, our findings reveal a universal oxygen--oxygen distance of approximately $2.5$~Å at the moment of proton transfer across diverse chemistries, providing mechanistic insight and showing that macroscopic proton conductivity emerges from the interplay between anion rotational dynamics, hydrogen-bond network connectivity, and proton-transfer probability.

Abstract: Electronic structure calculations remain a major bottleneck in atomistic simulations and, not surprisingly, have attracted significant attention in machine learning (ML). Most existing approaches learn a direct map from molecular geometries, typically represented as graphs or encoded local environments, to molecular properties or use ML as a surrogate for electronic structure theory by targeting quantities such as Fock or density matrices expressed in an atomic orbital (AO) basis.
  Inspired by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, in this work, we propose an operator-centered framework in which the external (nuclear) potential, expressed in an AO basis, serves as the model input. From this operator, we construct hierarchical, body-ordered representations of atomic configurations that closely mirror the principles underlying several popular atom-centered descriptors. At the same time, the matrix-valued nature of the external potential provides a natural connection to equivariant message-passing neural networks. In particular, we show that successive products of the external potential provide a scalable route to equivariant message passing and enable an efficient description of long-range effects. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to model molecular properties, such as energies and dipole moments, from the external potential, or learn effective operator-to-operator maps, including mappings to the Fock matrix and the reduced density matrix from which multiple molecular observables can be simultaneously derived.

TL;DR: Derive analytical nuclear gradients for SACIS and SAECIS, enabling efficient geometry optimization and ME searching at low cost. Methods perform well, capturing conical intersections and offering good performance with SACIS being more cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop efficient and accurate methods for geometry optimization and ME searching, which are crucial for computational chemistry.

Method: The method involves deriving analytical nuclear gradients for SACIS and SAECIS using a Lagrangian approach, removing null-space contributions for numerical stability.

Result: The results show that both SACIS and SAECIS accurately reproduce the conical intersection topology and benchmark calculations demonstrate their effectiveness in computing geometries with good accuracy.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that SACIS and SAECIS provide reliable and cost-efficient methods for conical intersection studies, with SACIS offering better value for general applications.

Abstract: We derive analytical nuclear gradients for state-averaged configuration interaction singles (SACIS) and its spin-projected extension (SAECIS), enabling efficient geometry optimization and minimum-energy conical intersection (MECX) searches within a low-cost CIS-based framework. The formulation employs a Lagrangian approach and explicitly removes null-space contributions in the coupled perturbed equations to ensure numerically stable gradients. For twisted-pyramidalized ethylene, both SACIS and SAECIS qualitatively reproduce the correct conical intersection topology, in sharp contrast to conventional CIS and ECIS. Benchmark calculations on twelve MECXs demonstrate that both methods reproduce geometries with mean RMSDs below 0.1~Å relative to high-level reference methods. SACIS captures the essential degeneracy through variational orbital relaxation, which alleviates ground-state Hartree--Fock (HF) orbital bias and effectively incorporates static correlation through localization effects; notably, spin projection is found to be non-essential for the qualitative description of these intersections. Overall, SACIS and SAECIS provide qualitatively reliable CX descriptions at mean-field computational cost in a black-box manner. Given their comparable accuracy and the additional overhead associated with spin projection, SACIS offers a more favorable cost-performance balance for general applications, whereas SAECIS may become advantageous when higher excited states with significant double-excitation character are involved.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Shallow ensembles are effective for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials but require balancing calibration with computational cost. Explicit optimization of a negative log-likelihood loss improves calibration compared to other ensemble methods, though it increases computational overhead. An efficient protocol combining full-model fine-tuning with probabilistic training reduces calibration quality minimally while significantly lowering training time. This approach enables reliable uncertainty quantification across multiple materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and quantifying uncertainties in machine learning models, particularly in interatomic potentials, is crucial for applications in materials science and chemistry. Efficient and reliable methods for uncertainty quantification can improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of predictions in these fields.

Method: The study investigates training strategies for shallow ensembles by comparing different loss functions, namely ensembles based on randomly initialized models, last-layer Laplace approximation, and explicit optimization of negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss. The protocol involves full-model fine-tuning of an ensemble trained with a probabilistic energy loss or sampled from the Laplace posterior.

Result: Explicit optimization of NLL improves calibration, but increases computational overhead. The protocol reduces training time by up to 96% while maintaining calibration quality, enabling practical implementation of reliable uncertainty quantification across various materials.

Conclusion: Efficient training protocols for shallow ensembles provide a practical solution for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials, balancing computational efficiency with required calibration accuracy.

Abstract: Shallow ensembles provide a convenient strategy for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials, that is computationally efficient because the different ensemble members share a large part of the model weights. In this work, we systematically investigate training strategies for shallow ensembles to balance calibration performance with computational cost. We first demonstrate that explicit optimization of a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss improves calibration with respect to approaches based on ensembles of randomly initialized models, or on a last-layer Laplace approximation. However, models trained solely on energy objectives yield miscalibrated force estimates. We show that explicitly modeling force uncertainties via an NLL objective is essential for reliable calibration, though it typically incurs a significant computational overhead. To address this, we validate an efficient protocol: full-model fine-tuning of a shallow ensemble originally trained with a probabilistic energy loss, or one sampled from the Laplace posterior. This approach results in negligible reduction in calibration quality compared to training from scratch, while reducing training time by up to 96%. We evaluate this protocol across a diverse range of materials, including amorphous carbon, ionic liquids (BMIM), liquid water (H$_2$O), barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$), and a model tetrapeptide (Ac-Ala3-NHMe), establishing practical guidelines for reliable uncertainty quantification in atomistic machine learning.

Abstract: The focus of this educational text is selected examples of high-frequency electronic circuits and their components employed for the accurate phasing and synchronisation of accelerator cavities. Examples have been chosen to describe the basics of RF electronics. The starting point is transmission lines, connectors, discontinuities, and the handling of reflection. The application of simple surface mount components is discussed. The use of the Kuroda identities for converting lumped circuit designs to printed circuit designs is demonstrated. The accelerator example used to demonstrate the use of components is a circuit designed for the synchronisation of the CLIC crab cavities. This example employs co-planar waveguide, SMA connectors, Wilkinson splitters, and surface-mount double-balanced mixers. For the control of cavity phase and amplitude, the benefit of I&Q controllers will be explained. The text will then discuss the operation and use of I&Q modulators and VCOs.

Abstract: We present the development and evaluation of a real-time Graph Neural Network-based trigger for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider. The algorithm processes calorimeter trigger cells as graph nodes to perform clustering, feature extraction, and per-cluster signal classification with deterministic latency compatible with the first-level trigger readout system. The model predicts cluster positions and energies and provides a signal classification score, enabling a more flexible clustering strategy than the baseline trigger algorithm. Implemented on an FPGA and integrated into the Belle II trigger chain for synchronous operation, the system sustains the 8 MHz trigger throughput with an end-to-end latency of 3.168 $μ$s. The performance is evaluated using simulated events and collision data. The energy resolution is comparable to the baseline trigger, while the position resolution for high-energy clusters improves by up to 18 percent in the central detector region. Cluster purity increases by up to 20 percent at low energies for isolated clusters, and cluster efficiency improves by up to 20 percent for overlapping clusters. The signal classifier enables additional background suppression at fixed signal retention. These results demonstrate the first operation of a Graph Neural Network-based reconstruction system implemented on FPGAs within the real-time trigger readout path of a collider experiment.

Abstract: Germanium-tin (GeSn) photodiodes potentiate a viable solution to integrate SWIR and extended SWIR detection technology into CMOS processing line. However, challenges in the growth of thick, high quality GeSn limit the device absorber thickness, making it impossible to ascertain the performance limit of GeSn photodiodes. An in-depth understanding of their device physics and a clear optimization pathway towards commercial-grade devices remain elusive. This work presents a systematic empirical study of GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber (2 to 8% Sn content, up to 2630 nm thick), showing high responsivity up to 0.59 A.W-1 at 1.55 μm and 0.43 A.W-1 at 2 μm wavelengths, low dark current density down to 2 x 10-2 A.cm-2, and high detection cutoff wavelengths up to 2.1 and 2.5 μm at 5% and 8% Sn, respectively. Using specific doping design (P-i-N and N-i-P), an in-depth analysis is presented on the impact of junction position, p-type background carrier concentration, bulk/ surface defects and photocarrier diffusion length - on photodetection performance. Different optimization strategies for GeSn photodiodes, in particular at high Sn content, are proposed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Germanium detectors are key in nuclear and particle physics, but understanding their internal structure and impurities is essential for improving their performance. This study aims to provide a detailed map of the detector’s internal state.

Method: The method involves using Compton scattering to measure spatially-resolved efficiency and then creating 3D images of the detector's non-depleted regions by fitting with software. They use stepwise bias voltages and compare their results with capacitance measurements.

Result: They successfully created 3D maps of the detector’s non-depleted volumes and measured the impurity density with good precision, achieving results comparable to capacitance measurements.

Conclusion: This is a significant advancement in understanding and optimizing germanium detectors, offering a new way to gauge internal quality and performance.

Abstract: The shape of the undepleted volume of a p-type high-purity Broad Energy Germanium detector, dependent on the bias voltage, has been imaged by measuring spatially-resolved Compton-scattering efficiency. The bias voltage was raised stepwise from $-50\,\text{V}$ to the full-depletion voltage. The geometric acceptance was determined at full depletion. Below full depletion, the relative acceptance observed for $2\times2\times2\,\text{mm}^3$ voxels was used to create the image of the undepleted volume for each bias voltage. The images were used to extract the impurity density profile of the detector by fitting predictions of the open-source software package SolidStateDetectors$.$jl to the images. The result is shown and compared to the impurity density profile deduced from capacitance measurements. This is the first time that three-dimensional images of the undepleted volumes of a germanium detector have become available and have been used to deduce an impurity density profile.

TL;DR: Schwarzschild black holes in prolate halos can lead to ordered or chaotic orbits depending on spin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole dynamics is key to exploring galaxy evolution and dark matter.

Method: Used multipole expansion and chaos indicators like Poincare sections and MLE for analysis.

Result: Model shows prolate halos affect orbit order/disorder, modulated by SMBH spin.

Conclusion: SMBH spin and halo structure significantly influence nearby orbits, impacting galaxy activity.

Abstract: The majority of galaxies are known to have supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their core, which have a tremendous gravitational pull on the objects around them. When embedded within extended matter distributions such as prolate, shell-like halos, they give rise to complex gravitational fields that often drive nearby particles into chaotic orbits. The inherently nonlinear nature of such motion, shaped by general relativity, makes direct analysis highly challenging. To overcome this, pseudo-Newtonian potentials are used to approximate relativistic effects within a Newtonian framework. In this study, we model the central SMBH using the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov (1996) potential to mimic the rotational effects of a Kerr-like black hole. The surrounding prolate halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution, represented through a multipole expansion including dipole and quadrupole components. Poincare sections and the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) reveal how the SMBH-halo system drives both order and chaos, with the SMBH spin modulating the dynamics by enhancing or suppressing chaos depending on its direction and magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to develop tunable, low-loss, and efficient photonic filters for improving signal processing in telecommunications and sensing despite interference and noise.

Method: The filters were designed using multi-cavity structures with large free spectral ranges and high quality factors, fabricated via silicon nitride, and tested achieving 520 MHz bandwidth and 55 dB out-of-band rejection.

Result: They achieved record insertion loss (2 dB) and tuning range (1 FSR ~ 70 GHz), suitable for various front-end applications.

Conclusion: These filters advance integrated photonic systems significantly, meeting high-performance metrics needed for modern applications.

Abstract: Tunable, low-loss, narrowband, and frequency-stabilized filters play a critical role in the realization of transceivers for efficient signal processing in telecommunications and sensing applications in the presence of strong interference and noise. We systematically design, fabricate, and demonstrate multi-cavity, multipole integrated photonic bandpass filters with gigahertz to sub-gigahertz bandwidths. The filters feature ultra-wideband tunable center frequencies exceeding 400 GHz, ultra-low insertion loss, steep roll-off, and compact footprints, making them suitable for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave front-end applications. Using a set of design principles for multi-cavity high-order filters together with supporting nanofabrication techniques in a silicon nitride platform, the demonstrated filters achieve record-high figures of merit and advance the state of the art in integrated photonic filtering for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave systems. The resonator structures, which are the key building blocks enabling the reported performance, combine a large free spectral range of approximately 70 GHz with a high quality factor of 2.1 times ten to the power of seven. This performance is enabled by combining wide multimode waveguide segments with narrow single-mode regions connected through adiabatic tapers. To the best of our knowledge, the experimentally demonstrated bandwidth of 520 MHz, tuning range of one free spectral range, filter insertion loss of 2 dB, and out-of-band rejection ratios of up to 55 dB represent record performance metrics for integrated photonic filtering of radio-frequency, millimeter-wave, and terahertz signals.

Abstract: Transformation optics (TO) is a new method to design metamaterials that can manipulate electromagnetic fields. Inspired by the traditional TO techniques which is mostly based on the solid metamaterials with a limited range of tunability, a novel streamline tracing-based transformation optofluidics (STTOF) method is proposed to manipulate the light path by analytically designating the light-carrying streamlines of the flow in a two-dimensional circular bounded domain. A dipole flow model is built to analytically calculate the streamlines of the flow field inside the domain which allocates the optical/fluidic source and sink pairs at arbitrary positions. Liquid core/liquid cladding (L2) configuration is used in the experiment to trace the light via a specific streamline. Experimental results verify that the light paths agree well with the theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that a good range of tunability can be achieved by adjusting the flow rates and the source-sink positions of optical/fluidic source and sink pairs.

Abstract: Optical topologies in the form of Skyrmions have attracted significant interest of late, where their integer Skyrmion number has been shown to be robust to complex media.

We unravel the map structure to reveal a new phenomenon, the abrupt transition jumps in skyrmion number, which serves to reinforce the integer nature of skyrmion topologies. Our experimental demonstration agrees well with simulation, opening a new spectrum of optical topologies to explore, with exciting possibilities in optical communication and sensing.

Conclusion: 通过SVD方法，成功预测和解释了BIC的产生条件，并为实际应用提供了设计指导。

Abstract: Understanding how bound states in the continuum (BICs) emerge in periodic metasurfaces is essential for the controlled design of high-Q resonances and their systematic manipulation. Here, we investigate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the effective transition matrix and the scattering matrix of periodic metasurfaces within a parameter range where the metasurface sustains a BIC. Our analysis yields general and practically applicable conditions on the singular values and singular vectors that enable BIC formation. At the BIC eigenfrequency, the inverse of the largest singular value of both matrices vanishes, and the corresponding left (right) singular vector is orthogonal to outgoing (incoming) plane waves that propagate in the directions of open diffraction orders. Our SVD-based approach predicts the spectral position of the BIC and provides detailed information about its properties, including the expansion coefficients in the multipole and plane-wave bases, as well as its behavior under perturbations that transform the BIC into a quasi-BIC. The approach is numerically validated by considering both symmetry-protected and accidental BICs in arrays of scatterers supporting electromagnetic or acoustic multipole resonances. The presented SVD framework offers a broadly applicable foundation for engineering BICs and quasi-BICs in complex metasurfaces, potentially enabling new routes for wave-based devices with tailored radiative properties.

TL;DR: PRISM enables efficient, manufacturable, and high-yield inverse-designed photonic hardware by optimizing for optics and reducing calibration efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of fabricating high-performance photonic components designed through inverse methods, which face significant manufacturability issues. PRISM introduces a novel workflow combining physics-based optimization with inverse lithography to overcome these limitations.

Method: PRISM consists of three key steps: (1) synthesizing compact calibration patterns that minimize required fabrication data, (2) training a physics-grounded differentiable fabrication model for gradient-based optimization, and (3) performing photonics-informed inverse mask optimization focusing on performance-critical features beyond mere geometry matching.

Result: PRISM significantly improves post-fabrication performance and yield, reduces calibration area and turnaround time, and enables inverse-designed photonic hardware to be accessible and manufacturable at scale.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for scaling up inverse-designed photonic hardware by addressing critical manufacturability barriers through optics-informed mask optimization workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in photonic inverse design have demonstrated the ability to automatically synthesize compact, high-performance photonic components that surpass conventional, hand-designed structures, offering a promising path toward scalable and functionality-rich photonic hardware. However, the practical deployment of inverse-designed PICs is bottlenecked by manufacturability: their irregular, subwavelength geometries are highly sensitive to fabrication variations, leading to large performance degradation, low yield, and a persistent gap between simulated optimality and fabricated performance. Unlike electronics, photonics lacks a systematic, flexible mask optimization flow. Fabrication deviations in photonic components cause large optical response drift and compounding error in cascaded circuits, while calibrating fabrication models remains costly and expertise-heavy, often requiring repeated fabrication cycles that are inaccessible to most designers. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRISM, a photonics-informed inverse lithography workflow that makes photonic mask optimization data-efficient, reliable, and optics-informed. PRISM (i) synthesizes compact, informative calibration patterns to minimize required fabrication data, (ii) trains a physics-grounded differentiable fabrication model, enabling gradient-based optimization, and (iii) performs photonics-informed inverse mask optimization that prioritizes performance-critical features beyond geometry matching. Across multiple inverse-designed components with both electron-beam lithography and deep ultra-violet photolithography processes, PRISM significantly boosts post-fabrication performance and yield while reducing calibration area and turnaround time, enabling and democratizing manufacturable and high-yield inverse-designed photonic hardware at scale.

Result: 实现了从8 GHz到16 GHz的全 octave 调谐范围，相位噪声在khz 偏移下达到每赫兹 -140 dBc，高频噪声上限在每赫兹 -155 下限在 -145 dBc。这种性能对应于单 Femtosecond 积分时间计时抖动，这是光参考微波合成技术的首次实现。

Conclusion: 通过前向 feed-forward eOFD 技术，研究者成功实现了高纯度光参考微波合成器，显著扩展了微波源的调谐范围和提高了性能，为多个应用领域提供了强有力的技术支持。

Abstract: Microwave synthesizers are central to test and measurement systems across applications including wireless communications, radar, spectroscopy, and time and frequency metrology. State-of-the-art microwave sources, however, are fundamentally constrained by trade-offs between frequency tunability and spectral purity. Electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) is an emerging technique for dividing down the purity of optical sources to the microwave domain. Previously reported eOFD-based synthesizers generally have limited tunability due to feedback stabilization requirements. Here we demonstrate a feed-forward eOFD architecture in which the frequency tunability of a microwave source is preserved while optical spectral purity is divided through feed-forward cancellation, without any downstream electronic frequency synthesis. By canceling the phase noise of the microwave source without feedback, this eOFD approach removes loop bandwidth and source noise constraints observed in prior eOFD architectures. We achieve octave-spanning tunability, including the entire X-band, with phase noise below -140 dBc/Hz at kilohertz offsets and a high-frequency noise floor between -155 dBc/Hz and -145 dBc/Hz for carrier frequencies from 8 to 16 GHz. This performance corresponds to single-femtosecond integrated timing jitter, enabling, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of coherent, optically referenced microwave synthesis under wide tuning with this level of spectral purity.

Conclusion: 完entence，为工程和应用中的[chiral]光学响应提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Chiroptical responses in atomic systems are usually weak, as they arise from the interference between electric- and much weaker magnetic-dipole transitions. We show that atoms arranged in chiral geometries can instead exhibit a strong collective chiroptical response mediated entirely by electric-dipole interactions. Using a coupled-dipole framework, we identify a regime of pronounced chiroptical response emerging at subwavelength interatomic separations, which can be tuned by the probe frequency. This enhancement is directly linked to the formation of subradiant collective modes. Our results establish a fundamental connection between geometric chirality and collective light-matter interactions, opening new pathways for engineering and exploiting chiral optical responses in atomic systems.

For the theoretical approach, the continued Green's function within the formalism of Fano-Feshbach is applied. We present the measured lifetime value of $100 \pm 10 \text{ ns}$. The calculated lifetime value is 75 ns, and is associated with the (2p$^3$3s$^2$)$^4$S state of O$^-$. We discuss how the existence of a 100-ns-lifetime oxygen metastable anion can impact the modeling of oxygen-containing systems.

Abstract: The application of mass-analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) for the state-selective preparation of molecular ions is presented. Based on photoexcitation of long-lived high-$n$ Rydberg states, molecular ions are prepared in a single rovibronic level by pulsed-field ionization. We present a theoretical analysis and a recipe for obtaining an optimal energy ratio between such selected ions and molecular ions in unwanted rovibronic states, created by direct photoionization. It is shown that the second-order chromatic aberration of a dc quadrupole bender can be used to isolate the state-selectively prepared molecular ions. The phase-space properties of ions prepared by MATI are ideally suited for axial injection into a linear radio-frequency trap. A modified approach for carrying out MATI within such an ion trap is also described.

Abstract: Laser cooling and trapping of atomic matter waves in optical potentials has enabled rapid progress in quantum science, particularly when combined with Rydberg excitation of the atoms to induce long-range interactions. Here, we propose the local manipulation and spatio-temporal sculpting of the electronic matter wave of a Rydberg atom by a laser field focused so that its beam width is smaller than the Rydberg electron orbit. We compute the electronic eigenstates in the presence of a sharply focused Gaussian laser beam, and find strong Rydberg state mixing leading to large kilo-Debye dipole moments. These can be modulated with high bandwidth controlled by the local tweezer intensity. Oscillations in the position-dependent level shifts, analogous to the potential wells allowing ultralong-range Rydberg molecules to form, provide opportunities to trap the Rydberg atom in an eccentric way via ponderomotive forces acting on sub-orbital length scales.

Method: The authors use a rotating reference frame and effective Hamiltonian to describe the resonant states in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms with a rapidly oscillating scattering length. They then demonstrate experimentally that this system can simulate a time-independent two-component atomic mixture with exotic, long-range interactions.

Result: The results show that the system exhibits exotic, long-range interactions that are not present in conventional atomic mixtures. This opens up new possibilities for studying complex quantum systems in a controlled laboratory environment.

Conclusion: By leveraging the properties of ultracold bosonic atoms and fast periodic driving, the authors have created a model system that can simulate exotic atomic interactions, offering a new tool for studying quantum phenomena.

Abstract: In systems with fast periodic driving, there are special subsets of (resonant) states, which behavior can be described with effective, time-independent Hamiltonian in a rotating reference frame. Here, we show that experimentally feasible system of ultracold bosonic atoms on a ring with rapidly oscillating scattering length can be used to simulate time-independent two-component atomic mixture with exotic, long-range interactions.

TL;DR: 研究了零温二维玻色-费米混合物的机械稳定性问题，系统中存在可调节的玻色-费米相互作用和较弱但有限的玻色-玻色排斥作用。分析采用最低阶受约束变分(LOCV)方法，在该框架内通过解析清晰的处理强物种间相互作用的同时进行非扰分析。玻色-费米相互作用被一个正则化的吸引接触势合理建模，可探索吸引和排斥势能分支。推导了使混合物机械稳定的必要玻色-玻色排斥作用，通过在玻色-费米相互作用强弱范围内评估反压可压缩矩阵来完成此任务，在LOCV方法适用域内实现了解析透明。玻色-费米相互作用能量贡献被与实验数据和量子蒙特卡罗结果相比对，在单一杂质极限下两者吻合良好。分析结果明确无误地揭示了玻色-玻色耦合在相互作用强度、物种密度失衡和物种质量比上的相关性。特别地，玻色种和费米种质量相同时，混合物表现出更好的机械稳定性，在该情况下即使玻色-玻色相互作用很微弱，混合物也能得到有效的机械稳定性。结果显示，在该情况下，触极微弱的玻色-玻色相互作用就足以在所有玻色-费米相互作用值下稳定吸引性的混合物。这些结果为实验上可实现的二维玻色-费米混合物的稳定性条件评估提供理论框架。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of mechanical stability in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature, focusing on systems with a tunable Bose-Fermi (BF) interaction and a weak but finite boson-boson (BB) repulsion. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions.
