### [1] [Effect of the avoided crossing on the rovibrational energy levels, resonances, and predissociation lifetimes within the ground and first excited electronic states of lithium fluoride](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02085)
*V. G. Ushakov,A. Yu. Ermilov,E. S. Medvedev*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更准确地理解LiF的光谱行为，特别是在第一离解极限以上的频段，开发了一种新的计算方法。

Method: 通过分子动力学模拟和量子力学计算，对LiF的光谱进行了详细分析。

Result: 计算所得的光谱结果与实验数据高度吻合，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为LiF光谱的详细计算提供了新的方法和数据，进一步确认了现有理论模型的准确性。

Abstract: We investigate the LiF spectrum up to $7800$ cm$^{-1}$ above the first dissociation limit. The ab initio calculations of the adiabatic potentials and other molecular functions are performed in a wide range of interatomic separations, $r=1$-17 bohr. We consider the model of two interacting electronic states including both the bound states and the resonances of two kinds, the tunneling resonances and the predissociative ones. The Born-Oppenheimer potentials are modeled with use of two functions imitating the diabatic terms whereas the coupling between them was set constant equal to the half of the minimum separation between the adiabatic terms, and then we define the final diabatic terms and the final diabatic coupling via the adiabatic potentials and the angle of the adiabatic-to-diabatic basis rotation obtained by integration of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element. The energies of the bound states, as well as the positions and widths of the resonances are calculated. The observed transition frequencies are reproduced with the standard deviation of 0.0009 cm$^{-1}$ for $^7$LiF, 0.0006 cm$^{-1}$ for $^6$LiF, and within the experimental uncertainties for the most of the lines. The line lists for the bound-bound $X$-$X$ rovibrational transitions are calculated for quantum numbers $v\le50,Δv\le15,J\le170$ ($J\le200$ for the 0-0 and 1-0 bands).

Abstract: A common concern in high-precision neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiments is that of magnetic field stability. For static fields, this problem can be mitigated through the use of a superconducting holding field coil, which when operated in persistent current mode serves to stabilize the magnetic field. However, such a solution is not viable when time-varying magnetic fields are present, as is the case for the spin dressing mode of the proposed nEDMSF (nEDM super-fluid) experiment. This experiment features an oscillating magnetic field to dress the gyromagnetic ratios of $^3$He and neutrons to the same value, a condition known as critical dressing. Fluctuations in the dressing field amplitude have the potential to disrupt this condition. Here, we investigate a modification to spin dressing, termed ``magic dressing,'' which renders the system insensitive to small variations in dressing field amplitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this method for the single spin-species case using a sample of polarized $^3$He. We find a dramatic increase in transverse relaxation time in the presence of magnetic field gradients.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a microwave system for the precise control of ultracold polar molecules, achieving high electric field intensity, low phase-noise, and tunable polarization, which enables advancements in quantum sciences applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop advanced microwave techniques to control and stabilize ultracold polar molecules for quantum sciences research.

Method: The researchers built a dual-feed waveguide antenna with high electric field intensity, implemented low noise signal sources, and developed tunable polarization systems. They used narrow-band filters to reduce phase-noise and employed homemade dipole probes and spectrum analyzers for measurements.

Result: They achieved a Rabi frequency of 71 MHz, reduced phase-noise by more than 20 dB, and evaporated a molecular sample to deep quantum degeneracy.

Conclusion: This work provides essential tools for controlling ultracold polar molecules, advancing quantum sciences applications.

Abstract: Microwave(MW) fields with strong field strength, ultralow phase-noise and tunable polarization are crucial for stabilizing and manipulating ultracold polar molecules, which have emerged as a promising platform for quantum sciences. In this letter, we present the design, characterization, and performance of a robust MW setup tailored for precise control of molecular states. This setup achieves a high electric field intensity of 6.9 kV/m in the near-field from a dual-feed waveguide antenna, enabling a Rabi frequency as high as 71 MHz for the rotational transition of sodium-potassium molecules. In addition, the low noise signal source and controlled electronics provide ultralow phase-noise and dynamically tunable polarization. Narrow-band filters within the MW circuitry further reduce phase-noise by more than 20 dB at 20 MHz offset frequency, ensuring prolonged one-body molecular lifetimes up to 10 seconds. We also show practical methods to measure the MW field strength and polarization using a simple homemade dipole probe, and to characterize phase-noise down to -170 dBc/Hz with a commercial spectrum analyser and a notch filter. Those capabilities allowed us to evaporatively cool our molecular sample to deep quantum degeneracy. Furthermore, the polarization tunability enabled the observation of field-linked resonances and facilitated the creation of field-linked tetramers.These techniques advance the study of ultracold polar molecules and broaden the potential applications of MW tools in other platforms of quantum sciences.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We discuss Euclidean geometries in AdS$_3$ whose Lorentzian slicing gives rise to closed baby universes with a spatial geometry given by genus $g\geq 2$ surfaces. Our setup only involves a two-dimensional holographic CFT defined on a higher genus Riemann surface and thus provides a well-posed alternative to shell states whose microscopic duals are less well understood. We find that geometries giving rise to baby universes are always subdominant. It follows that the baby universe does not provide a semi-classical description of the state since it is encoded in an exponentially suppressed part of the wave function. We then apply a prescription developed in \cite{Belin:2025wju} to make the baby universe geometry the leading saddle. In the process, the CFT state becomes mixed, in agreement with the qualitative gravitational picture. We show that the fluctuations in the baby universe are small, even at fixed central charge, making the geometry reliable in the semi-classical limit. Finally, we discuss the interpretation of this mixed state in pure gravity from the perspective of the Virasoro TQFT.

Conclusion: 证明了广义舒尔极限与量子蒙日矩阵迹的关联，并扩展到阿雷格斯-道格斯理论，这为理解这些理论的不动点性质提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We explore some aspects of the generalized Schur limit, defined in arXiv:2506.13764. Based on several examples, we conjecture that the generalized Schur limit as a function of $α$ solves a modular linear differential equation of fixed order, with coefficients depending on $α$. We also observe in examples that for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,G)$ with $G=A_n,D_n$, the generalized Schur limit for certain negative integer values of $α$, coincides with the trace of higher powers of the quantum monodromy operator. This hints at a more general correspondence between the wall-crossing invariant traces on the Coulomb branch and the generalized Schur limit, which is related to the Higgs branch.

Conclusion: 该研究在规范矩阵模型和超杨米尔斯理论之间建立了新的联系，并为理解磁场代数和非重子代数算子谱的结构提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: We study the structure of the Hilbert space of gauged matrix models with a global symmetry. In the first part of the paper, we focus on bosonic matrix models with $U(2)$ gauge group and $SO(d)$ global symmetry, and consider singlets under both the gauge and global symmetry. We show how such "double-gauged'' matrix models can be described in terms of a simpler $SO(3)$ single-matrix model. In the second part of the paper, we consider the so-called BMN subsector of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory, which is closely related to the BMN matrix model. Among the 1/16 BPS operators in this sector, "non-graviton'' operators were recently discovered, which are expected to relate to the microstates of supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black holes. We show that a double gauging of this model, where one projects onto $SU(3)_R$ $R$-symmetry singlets, considerably simplifies the analysis of the non-graviton spectrum. In particular, for low values of $N$, we show that (almost) all graviton operators project out of the spectrum, while important classes of non-graviton operators remain. In the $N=3$ case, we obtain a closed form expression for the superconformal index of singlet non-gravitons, which reveals structural features of their spectrum.

### [7] [Generalised 4d Partition Functions and Modular Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02107)
*A. Ramesh Chandra,Sunil Mukhi,Palash Singh*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We prove that a class of generalized Schur partition functions in 4d N=2 superconformal gauge theories are equivalent to contour integral representations of vector-valued modular forms arising in 2d RCFTs. We analyze the modular properties of these partition functions and propose extensions to include additional parameters. The findings are linked to quantum monodromy traces for specific values of a parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the deep connections between 4d gauge theories and 2d conformal field theories, particularly focusing on the modular properties of partition functions. This interplay between different areas of theoretical physics is a key motivation for the study.

Method: The authors employ a combination of analytic and algebraic methods. They use the concept of modular linear differential equations (MLDEs) to establish the equivalence between the partition functions and modular forms. They also consider specific specializations of parameters to connect with known results in RCFT.

Result: The authors successfully establish the equivalence between the partition functions and vector-valued modular forms. They derive explicit modular properties and propose extensions to include additional parameters, enhancing the understanding of the modular structure of these theories.

Conclusion: The work provides a significant bridge between 4d gauge theories and 2d RCFTs, particularly in understanding the modular properties of partition functions. The results have implications for both the mathematical and physical understanding of these theories.

Abstract: We prove the equivalence of a class of generalised Schur partition functions $\mathcal Z_G(q;α)$ of 4d $\mathcal N=2$ superconformal gauge theories to contour integral representations of vector-valued modular forms of the type that arise in 2d rational conformal field theories (RCFT). Concretely, we consider the $USp(2N)$ theory with $2N+2$ fundamental hypermultiplets and analytically prove that $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;α)$ satisfies an order-$(N+1)$ modular linear differential equation (MLDE) with vanishing Wronskian index, explaining how the parameter $α$ of the former determines the parameters of the latter. Several connections are made to characters of RCFTs including unitary ones. We then propose a two-parameter extension $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;α,β)$ of the generalised Schur partition function. Finally, we relate the $α=-k$ specialisation to quantum monodromy traces ${\rm Tr}\,M^k$ and formulate a conjecture linking their $k$-dependence to MLDEs.

Abstract: We present a new technique for computing supersymmetric Wilson loops in the ABJM theory via supersymmetric localization, valid for arbitrary values of the rank of the gauge group $N$ and the Chern-Simons level $k$. The approach relies on an operator representation of the Wilson loops within the Fermi gas formalism in terms of the resolvent of a certain integral operator previously encountered in the computation of the ABJM partition function on the round three-sphere. By deriving a set of nontrivial relations for this resolvent, we obtain exact expressions for the generating functions of Wilson loops in terms of the partition function. For large $k$, these expressions reproduce the weak-coupling expansion of the Wilson loops, and in the large-$N$ limit at fixed $k$ they match previously obtained high-precision numerical results. This analysis also resolves the longstanding discrepancy between numerical data and the semiclassical expression for the $1/6$ BPS Wilson loop.

Result: 发现两种规范超引力解的对称性分别为对角线群和非对称性，其中一个解是超对称的I-弦论背景，另一个解是非超对称的第四种S^5的形变AdS_5×S^5背景。研究表明，磁单极子导致角度动量间的混合，模拟了Isospin机制的效果。

Conclusion: 合冲磁单极子在超引力解中诱导了角度动量混合，使得对称性对角化。这一现象为研究磁单极子的对称性和量子效应提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Motivated by the spin from isospin mechanism of Jackiw-Rebbi-Hasenfratz-'t Hooft, we study two SU(2) gauged supergravity solutions of the form $M_{d}\times\text{S}^{2}$ containing non-Abelian hedgehog monopole on the 2-sphere. Due to the presence of the monopole, the SO(3) isometry group of the 2-sphere is not a symmetry of the configuration. Instead, a diagonal combination of the SU(2) gauge and the SO(3) isometry of the 2-sphere is the true symmetry of the configuration. Uplifting the solutions to Type II, the gauge-isometry diagonal symmetry becomes a diagonal combination between the SO(3) symmetry of the 2-sphere and a SU(2) symmetry of a 3-sphere used to uplift the configuration. One of the uplifts is supersymmetric and corresponds to the I-brane theory on a 2-sphere. The second background is a deformation of $\text{AdS}_{5}\times\text{S}^{5}$ and is not supersymmetric. We study dilaton fluctuations on the later geometry. Due to the diagonal symmetry, the fluctuations show angular momentum mixing between the SU(2) and SO(3) spins, mimicking the spin from isospin mechanism.

Abstract: We present general four-loop template $β$-functions and anomalous field dimensions for renormalisable scalar-fermion theories in three dimensions. By imposing $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, we obtain relations between the template RGE coefficients, valid in any renormalisation scheme. Directly in $d=3$, we identify a new theory with a non-trivial IR fixed point that is under perturbative control in a large-$N$ limit. We provide up-to-date numerical results for all required massive tadpole master integrals up to four loops and complement them with analytic expressions where available.

Conclusion: 揭示对称性在物理中的重要性，为理解量子系统提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.

TL;DR: 研究显示，在Jackiw-Teitelboim 引力中，信息悖论的解决体现在物质相关器表现出跳墙效应，这可以通过引力路径积分的次生最陡下降近似完全解释。涉及事件视界两侧的相关器展示跳墙行为，而同一侧的相关器则呈现指数衰减。这暗示着信息在由黑洞地平线分离的分立世界中流动。此外，所定义的dvlex时间与黑洞温度成反比，符合 holographic 对偶理论的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息悖论是量子力学与广义相对论之间的重要未解之谜，特别是在黑洞的热力学性质方面，尚未有充分的理解。通过研究 Jackiw-Teitelboim 引力中存在跳墙效应的相关器，可以深入探索该效应的物理机制及其实现方式，有助于阐明信息在量子纠缠体系中的传播。

Method: 研究采用了次生最陡下降近似方法，对该引力理论的路径积分进行了次生近似分析，研究了相关器的时间依赖性。通过匹配 holographic 对偶理论中的预测值，详细计算了相关器的时间行为，验证了研究结论的正确性。

Result: 结果表明，次生最陡下降近似方法能够精确地解释跳墙效应，相关器的时间行为和dvlex时间与理论预测一致，这为相关领域提供了强有力的理论支持和指导。

Conclusion: 研究结论展示了次生效应在Jackiw-Teitelboim 引力中的acted表现，为理解信息悖论及量子纠缠物质传播提供了新的视角。该研究对量子引力理论的发展具有重要的理论价值和潜在应用前景。

Abstract: We show that the solution of the information paradox in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity - manifested as a linear growth (ramp) followed by saturation (plateau) of matter correlators after an initial decay - is fully encoded in the next-to-leading-order steepest-descent approximation of the gravitational path integral. The correlators exhibiting this ramp-plateau behavior are those entangling the two sides of the eternal black hole, while those on the same side only show an exponential decay. This seems to imply that the information flows across the separate universes that are causally disconnected by the black hole horizon. Finally, we show that the dip-time, defined as the minimum of the correlator, grows inversely with the black hole temperature, as predicted by the holographic dual theory.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 在dS/CFT对应关系中，我们确定了小形变条件下伪熵的通用部分，发现二次项形变参数的校正由$dC_T$控制，并保持原结果的符号，表明球面是局部极值点。这一结果在高曲率理论中同样适用，如二次曲率引力。我们的发现扩展了Mezei公式至dS/CFT背景，并表明在dS空间中伪熵随形变的依赖性与AdS空间中熵的行为相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪熵在热力学和量子信息论中具有重要意义。在dS/CFT框架中，理解伪熵在形变情况下的行为可以提供量子引力和高能理论的关键见解。此外，该工作可能为广泛存在的齐次理论提供启发，并适用于不同维度的研究。

Method: 我们采用摄动方法，考虑小形变的二次项，计算了伪熵的变化，并分析了$dC_T$对结果的影响。通过在二次曲率引力中进行显式计算，我们验证了通用性的性质。

Result: 小形变情况下，伪熵的二次项由$dC_T$控制。这一结果表明，在非单元量子场论中，球是局部极值点。二次曲率引力中这一行为保持不变。

Conclusion: 我们的结果在dS/CFT对应关系中扩展了Mezei公式，表明伪熵的形状依赖性与AdS熵的行为相似。这为理解量子引力中的伪熵行为提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We determine the universal part of pseudoentropy for small shape deformations of spherical entangling surfaces in the context of de Sitter/conformal field theory (dS/CFT) correspondence. The leading correction at quadratic order in the deformation parameter is controlled by the coefficient of the two-point stress-energy tensor correlator, $C_T$, of the non-unitary dual CFT, and it retains the sign of the unperturbed result, thereby establishing the sphere as a local extremum. The same structure holds in higher-curvature theories, as we check explicitly for quadratic curvature gravity, suggesting a universal behavior across non-unitary holographic CFTs. Our findings extend the Mezei formula to the dS/CFT setting and indicate that the shape dependence of pseudoentropy in dS holography resembles that of entanglement entropy in AdS space.

*Sebastian Harris,Volker Schomerus,Takashi Tsuda*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework using generalised covering maps to study interfaces in symmetric product orbifolds and their relation to AdS₂ branes in string theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the gauge/gravity correspondence and exploring the structure of string theory on AdS space backgrounds.

Method: Developed a new class of generalised covering maps, applied a generalised Riemann-Hurwitz formula, and introduced diagrammatic rules for classifying maps.

Result: The new framework enables the computation of interface correlators matching string perturbation theory to all orders in the string coupling.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully provides a consistent and tractable method for calculating string scattering amplitudes in the AdS₂ context, advancing our understanding of gauge/gravity dualities.

Abstract: Symmetric product orbifolds provide a controlled environment to explore generic features of gauge theory and holography. The tractability of these theories lies in the complete characterisation of their gauge structure through holomorphic covering maps. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of generalised covering maps, which define a universal family of interfaces between symmetric product orbifolds. These interfaces coincide with the holographic interfaces that were recently proposed as duals to AdS$_2$ branes in pure NSNS AdS$_3$ backgrounds. The new covering-map description enables efficient evaluation of interface correlators via a generalisation of the Lunin-Mathur method. To organise these computations, we derive a generalised Riemann-Hurwitz formula for interface coverings and introduce novel diagrammatic rules that systematically classify these maps. The new framework allows us to define a concrete grand-canonical ensemble that has the correct properties to compute correlation functions dual to open string scattering amplitudes. Using the generalised Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we explicitly show that the correlators of the ensemble structurally match string perturbation theory to all orders in the string coupling.

Abstract: The symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes impose constraints on observables at infinity. The consequences of this have been extensively explored for S-matrix elements, where soft theorems are known to be equivalent to Ward identities for asymptotic symmetries. However, recently there has been interest in broader classes of asymptotic observables. Here, we consider soft graviton insertions in the 'in-in' formalism. We derive a Ward identity for supertranslations and compute two point functions for the soft charges for 'in-in' correlators. We find that the connected memory correlators are non-trivial in this set up and can be straightforwardly inferred from the average null energy (ANEC) correlators using observations from celestial Conformal Field Theory (cCFT).

Abstract: $α$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $α$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $α$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $α$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.

Abstract: We study new Seiberg-like dualities for 1d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories -- that is, supersymmetric gauged quantum mechanics -- with unitary gauge group and (anti)fundamental matter in chiral and fermi multiplets, and with non-zero Fayet--Iliopoulos parameter. Similarly to its higher-dimensional analogues, this 1d Seiberg duality is an infrared duality: the supersymmetric ground states of the dual gauge theories match exactly. We provide strong evidence for the dualities, including the matching of the flavoured Witten indices, a Higgs-branch derivation in terms of dual Grassmannian manifolds, and a detailed study of the Coulomb-branch ground states in the abelian case. We study how the supersymmetric ground states, in either dual description, depend on the sign of the Fayet--Iliopoulos parameter, and we explore the corresponding wall-crossing phenomenon. For some special values of the discrete parameters defining the unitary gauge theory, the dualities, combined with trivial wall-crossing, enhances to a triality. This includes, as a special case, the dimensional reduction to 1d of the 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Gadde--Gukov--Putrov triality.

Abstract: We study consistent truncations in the framework of Exceptional Generalised Geometry. We classify the 4-dimensional gauged supergravities that can be obtained as a consistent truncation of 10/11-dimensional supergravity. Any truncation is associated to a (generalised) $G_S$-structure with singlet intrinsic torsion. We give the full classification for all truncations associated to continuous structure groups and we discuss a few examples with discrete ones. We recover gauged supergravities corresponding to known truncations as well as others for which explicit truncations are still to be constructed. We also summarise similar results obtained in the literature for truncations to $d=5,6,7$ dimensions and we complete them, when needed.

Abstract: When the gauge group of a theory has infinite volume, defining the inner product on physical states becomes subtle. This is the case for gravity, even in exactly solvable models such as minisuperspace or low-dimensional theories: the physical states do not inherit an inner product in a straightforward manner, and different quantization procedures yield a priori inequivalent prescriptions. This is one of the main challenges when constructing gravitational Hilbert spaces. In this paper we study a quantization procedure known as group averaging, which is a special case of the BRST/BV formalism and has gained popularity as a promising connection between Dirac quantization and gravitational path integrals. We identify a large class of theories for which group averaging is ill-defined due to isometry groups with infinite volume, which includes Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. We propose a modification of group averaging to renormalize these infinite volumes and use it to quantize Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with a positive cosmological constant in closed universes. The resulting Hilbert space naturally splits into infinite-dimensional superselection sectors and has a positive-definite inner product. This is the first complete Dirac quantization of this theory, as we are able to capture all the physical states for the first time.

Abstract: Development of spintronic and quantum computing devices increases demand for efficient, energy saving method of spin manipulation at molecular scale. Polyoxovanadate molecular magnets being susceptible to both electric and magnetic fields may serve here as a good base material. In this paper two isostructural anions [V$_{12}$As$_8$O$_{40}$(HCO$_2$)]$^{n-}$ (with $n=3,5$) featuring two different mixed-valence states with itinerant and localized valence electrons are studied. The impact of the electric field on their magnetic properties is investigated by means of two complementary methods informed by magnetic measurements: effective Hamiltonian calculations and density functional theory. It is demonstrated that the magnetoelectric effect in theses molecules is induced mostly by relocation of itinerant electrons, is highly anisotropic, depends on the valence state and can be detected even at room temperature. These findings can pave the way to practical applications in which an electric field control over spin state is required.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Using a rotationally invariant formulation of spin-lattice coupling, we derive a rigorous definition of the chemical potential for magnon-polaron quasiparticles in collinear ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFMs), valid when magnetoelastic scattering equilibrates magnons and acoustic phonons on timescales much shorter than those associated with quasiparticle-nonconserving relaxation processes. While our microscopic framework applies to generic magnon-phonon interactions, here we focus on high-symmetry crystals where the two transverse acoustic modes form a degenerate doublet. This doublet can combine into circularly polarized phonons, making the chiral selectivity of the coupling manifest: the FM magnon mode hybridizes only with the co-rotating phonon, whereas in collinear AFMs each magnon branch of opposite handedness couples to the phonon of the same chirality. We show that, in both FM and AFM systems, the nonequilibrium magnon-polaron gas is governed by a single chemical potential conjugate to the conserved axial angular momentum. In FMs, the two hybrid branches in the co-rotating sector share this chemical potential, weighted by their magnonic fractions; in AFMs, the four magnon-polaron branches split into two chiral sectors that carry opposite angular momenta and couple with opposite sign to the same chemical potential. Building on this microscopic thermodynamic framework, we formulate a Boltzmann transport theory for magnon-polarons and derive compact expressions for angular-momentum and heat currents that interpolate continuously to the decoupled regime and reproduce the phenomenological magnon-polaron transport framework underlying previous spin Seebeck analyses.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are attractive platforms for realizing high-performance quantum bits (qubits). However, radio-frequency (RF) charge detection, which is a key technique for qubits readout, remains challenging in such systems. We demonstrate RF reflectometry with impedance matching for high-resistance quantum dot devices based on bilayer graphene and molybdenum disulfide. By integrating a tunable strontium titanate (SrTiO3) varactor into a resonant circuit, we achieve nearly perfect impedance matching, enabling sensitive charge detection. The demodulated RF signal clearly shows Coulomb oscillations, and the SrTiO3 varactor exhibits robustness against both magnetic fields and voltage noise on the varactor. Our results establish SrTiO3 varactors as effective tunable matching components for RF reflectometry in high-resistance 2D material quantum devices, providing a foundation for high-speed qubits readout.

Abstract: We present an open quantum theory for the thermal transport in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-$β$(FPU-$β$) lattice. In the theory, local bosons(LBs) are introduced as carriers for the transport. The LBs are stimulated by individual atoms in the lattice, which are different from the phonons that are collective motions of the atoms. The LBs move in the FPU chain and are governed by a set of stochastic differential equations(SDEs). The anharmonic interaction between the atoms in the lattice is transformed to a random field by the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and has been implemented in the set of SDEs. By solving the set of SDEs at the steady state, we study the influence of the anharmonic interaction on the thermal transport. Results show that the anharmonic interaction decreases the thermal current by trapping the LBs on the lattice sites, as well as increase the thermal current by enhancing the amount of the LBs for the transport. The competition between these two mechanisms makes the thermal conductivity of the lattice dependent on the anharmonic interaction non-monotonically. The finite size effect of the thermal conductivity has also been captured by the theory.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to identify Majorana bound states (MBSs) through drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system. MBSs are identified by their distinctive split peaks in drag transconductance. The symmetry and robustness of these peaks distinguish MBSs from Andreev bound states (ABSs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to unambiguously identify MBSs would enable fault-tolerant quantum computation, making this a key motivation for the research.

Method: A theoretical study combining the master equation approach with analysis of steady-state and transient dynamics reveals the distinctive signature of MBSs in drag transconductance.

Result: The study shows that MBSs can be detected through their symmetric and robust transconductance peaks, while ABSs have asymmetric and sensitive peaks.

Conclusion: This work provides clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs from ABSs and offers a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.

Abstract: Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.

Conclusion: 驱动方式显著影响拓扑态的范数不变性和态跃迁，摘要提供了一种新的方法来调控拓扑态的特性，可用于未来研究中进一步探索驱动策略对拓扑态的影响。

Abstract: We study the effect of driving the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using two unitary operators $U_1$ and $U_2$ in different combinations; the unitaries differ in the values of the inter-cell hopping amplitudes. Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $ε$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $εT$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $ε^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $ε$ and $T$. Finally, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a random order, the $LE$ rapidly decays to zero with increasing time. We have presented a qualitative understanding of the above results.

Motivation: Understanding the spin-orbit coupling effects in conflicting materials is essential for topological electronics and spintronic applications.

Method: The twist angle is controlled by aligning fractured edges and crystallographic etching of graphene. Weak anti-localization measurements are used to determine the strength of the Rasbha-type and valley-Zeeman-type SOC.

Result: The experiments confirm a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle, aligning with theoretical predictions. Additionally, it is demonstrated that mechanical pressure can tune the SOC strength.

Conclusion: The study successfully links theoretical predictions with experimental results, showing the tunability of SOC strength through twist angle and mechanical pressure, which is significant for advancing topological spintronic devices.

Abstract: Recently, proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been observed in heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene (ML-G) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WSe$_{2}$. Successful tuning of SOC in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures by applying mechanical pressure and electric fields was also demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, theoretical calculations predicted a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle between graphene and TMDC. Here, we put these predictions to experimental test in ML-G/ML-WSe$_{2}$/hBN-heterostructures, where the twist angle is determined by aligning fractured edges, and by crystallographic etching of graphene. By performing weak anti-localization measurements, we determine the strength of the Rasbha-type SOC ($λ_\mathrm{R}$) and the valley-Zeeman-type SOC ($λ_\mathrm{VZ}$). Our experiments confirm a strong twist angle dependence of the proximity-induced SOC in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the tunability of the SOC strength via mechanical pressure, which is in agreement with earlier findings.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium self-assembly is the root of all emergent complexity, including life. In quantum materials emergent metastable states have become a very fashionable topic of research, but the study of resulting mesoscopic state dynamics is hindered by the absence of appropriate methods. Here we pioneer the use of fast-scanning tunnelling microscope (FSTM) techniques to investigate the internal dynamics of mesoscopic metastable topologically non-trivial defects in an electronic Wigner crystal superlattice created by a local electromagnetic perturbation. This allows us to record unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories in real-time on the millisecond timescale. Such dynamics is understood to arise from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states localised at the Y junction with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom that lead to the formation of localised quasiparticles with slow internal dynamics. Their unprecedented robustness against external perturbations comes from non-local constraints and non-trivial broken symmetries. Two-level system telegraph noise maps at the junction show phase and amplitude that is correlated with the observed electron motion trajectories. Such observation of single-particle dynamics in real time fundamentally transforms our understanding of metastable quantum states in electronic crystals and paves the way for technological advancements that make use of engineered topologically non-trivial defects.

Motivation: Understanding topological phases in moire layers is important for advancing materials science and electronics, particularly for novel electronic states and potential applications in quantum computing.

Method: Theoretically analyzed the system using a model that considers spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions, performing calculations such as band structure analysis and topology calculation.

Result: The system exhibits QVHI and QAHI phases, confirming that long-range interactions can mediate electron tunneling and create topological bands. Mixing of s-wave and p±ip-wave symmetries can occur, and a Zeeman field can induce a single-valley QAHI state.

Conclusion: These findings expand our knowledge of topological phases in moire materials and open avenues for exploring new electronic states and functionalities.

Abstract: We explore the emergence of topological phases in moiré MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayer, highlighting the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions at two holes per moiré unit cell $v = 2$. Our analysis uncovers robust Quantum Valley Hall Insulating (QVHI) phase and reveals that long-range interactions alone can mediate the interlayer electron tunneling, generating topologically nontrivial bands even in the absence of the corresponding single-particle hopping. Additionally, we show that in the case of band mixing terms originating both from the interaction and single particle physics a competition between topological states realizing $s$-$wave$ and $p\pm ip$-$wave$ symmetries can appear. Moreover, within the considered theoretical framework, we present that by introducing a small Zeeman field, one can lift the band inversion in one of the valleys. This leads to a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating (QAHI) state with the topological gap opening in a single valley and the other being topologically trivial.

Abstract: Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.

Abstract: Single-photon sources based on neutral or charged excitons in a semiconductor quantum dot are attractive resources for photonic quantum computers and simulators. To obtain indistinguishable photons, the source is pumped on resonance with polarized laser pulses, and the output is collected in orthogonal polarization. However, for sources featuring vertical emission of light, 50% of the emitted photons are unavoidably lost in this way. Here, we theoretically study the quantum dynamics of an exciton embedded in an asymmetric vertical cavity that favors emission in a specific polarization. We identify the configuration for optimal state initialization and demonstrate a path toward near-unity polarized efficiency. We also derive simple analytical formulas for the photon output in each polarization as a function of the Purcell-enhanced emission rates, which shed light on the physical mechanism behind our results.

Abstract: Superconductor-to-metal transitions (SMTs) are key probes of mesoscopic superconductivity, but their interpretation can be complicated by device geometry and measurement conditions. Here, we study epitaxial InAs-Al nanowires and show that metallic contacts induce an inverse proximity effect (IPE), creating weak spots in the superconductor that strongly suppress the critical current and give rise to an anomalous metallic phase. Using transport measurements supported by Usadel theory, we demonstrate that this phase originates from the contact-induced weakening of superconductivity together with Joule heating, rather than intrinsic material properties. Our findings reveal an overlooked observer effect in mesoscopic superconductors and provide essential guidance for interpreting SMTs and for designing devices based on these systems.

Abstract: We numerically and analytically study the transient dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets under a magnetic field gradient. We consider skyrmions in a bilayer with antiferromagnetic coupling between the layers. The skyrmions in the two layers move almost perpendicular to the field gradient and the motion is eventually halted with the two skyrmions at a distance from each other. We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approximation. We further provide an exact treatment of the dynamics that indicates that deviations from exact memory of the skyrmion position can arise.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable ability of plasmons to boost radiative emission rates, we propose leveraging acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) to realize tunable, giant Purcell enhancements for single-photon, entangled-photon, and multipolar quantum emitters. These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\% and 89\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $λ=1.55$ $μ$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.

Abstract: Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.

Abstract: Breathers on an elliptic wave background consist of nonlinear superpositions of a soliton and a periodic wave, both traveling with different wave speeds and interacting periodically in the space-time. For the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, the construction of general breathers has been an open problem since the elliptic wave is related to the elliptic degeneration of the hyperelliptic solutions of genus two. We have found the new representation of eigenfunctions of the Lax operator associated with the elliptic wave, which enables us to solve this open problem and to construct two families of breathers with bright (elevation) and dark (depression) profiles.

Motivation: The paper was motivated by the need for accurate and efficient atomic gradient sensing in quantum metrology systems.

Method: EIT and absorption-based methods were compared in a four-level tripod system under identical conditions.

Result: EIT outperformed absorption in tasks like gradient sensing and sub-wavelength localization, with superior resolution and edge contrast.

Conclusion: EIT proves to be fundamentally superior for precision atomic gradient sensing and metrology applications.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theoretical comparison between absorption-based and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based atomic gradient sensing in a four-level tripod system. Both methods were evaluated under identical and optimized physical conditions to ensure a fair and unbiased comparison. The analysis demonstrates that EIT, driven by its steep dispersion response, consistently outperforms conventional absorption detection across a wide range of super-Gaussian beam profiles. Under optimal detuning, EIT achieved up to an order-of-magnitude enhancement in gradient sensitivity and maintained a twofold advantage even under identical detuning. Both approaches reached sub-diffraction spatial resolution in the range of 0.29lambda-0.40lambda, with EIT exhibiting sharper edge contrast and higher localization accuracy. These results confirm EIT as a fundamentally superior approach for precision atomic gradient sensing and sub-wavelength localization, offering clear guidance for the design of next-generation optical and quantum metrology systems.

Abstract: Frequency control in power systems is critical to maintaining stability and preventing blackouts. Traditional methods like meta-heuristic algorithms and machine learning face limitations in real-time applicability and scalability. This paper introduces a novel approach using a pure variational quantum circuit (VQC) for real-time secondary frequency control in diesel generators. Unlike hybrid classical-quantum models, the proposed VQC operates independently during execution, eliminating latency from classical-quantum data exchange. The VQC is trained via supervised learning to map historical frequency deviations to optimal Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters using a pre-computed lookup table. Simulations demonstrate that the VQC achieves high prediction accuracy (over 90%) with sufficient quantum measurement shots and generalizes well across diverse test events. The quantum-optimized PI parameters significantly improve transient response, reducing frequency fluctuations and settling time.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve feature extraction and classification tasks in high-dimensional data domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14. Our results indicate that hybrid QCNN architectures can leverage entanglement and quantum feature fusion to enhance medical image classification tasks. This work establishes a statistical validation framework for assessing hybrid quantum models in biomedical applications and highlights pathways for scaling to larger datasets and deployment on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Barren plateaus, which means the training gradients become extremely small, pose a major challenge in optimizing parameterized quantum circuits, often making the learning process impractically slow or stall. This work shows why using neural networks to generate quantum circuit parameters helps overcome this difficulty. We introduce a geometric viewpoint that describes how the parameters produced by neural networks evolve during training. Our analysis shows that these parameters follow smooth and efficient paths that avoid the flat regions in the training that cause barren plateaus. This provides a computational explanation for the improved trainability observed in recent neural network-assisted quantum learning methods. Overall, our findings bridge ideas from quantum machine learning and computational optimization, offering new insight into the structure of quantum models and guiding future approaches for designing more trainable quantum circuits or parameter initialization.

Abstract: The detection of few-photon signals in a broadband background is an extreme challenge for photon counting, requiring filtering that accepts a narrow range of optical frequencies while strongly rejecting all others. Recent work [Zarraoa et. al, Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033338 (2024)] demonstrated that trapped single atoms can act as low dark-count narrow-band photodetectors. Here we show that this ``quantum jump photodetector'' (QJPD) approach can also detect photon-level signals embedded in strong sunlight. Using a single rubidium atom as a QJPD, we count arrivals of individual narrow-band laser photons embedded in sunlight powers of order $10^{10}$ photons/s. We derive a rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics in sunlight, and find quantitative agreement with experiment. Using this model, we calculate the channel capacity over a noisy communication channel when sending weak coherent states and detecting them in the presence of sunlight, achieving a representative rate of 0.5 bits per symbol when sending 150 probe photons per 10 ms time-bin, embedded in 1 nW of sunlight (of order $10^{10}$ photons/s in the visible and near-infrared bands). The demonstration may benefit background-limited applications such as daytime light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote magnetometry, and free-space classical and quantum optical communications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitation of quantum algorithms being limited to Betti numbers, providing more useful topological information for real-world applications.

Method: They combine the LGZ algorithm for Betti numbers with quantum-classical techniques, including eigenvector mining and quantum support vector machines to create persistence diagrams.

Result: They achieve the first quantum algorithm for practical persistence diagrams, enhancing both quantum speed and application utility.

Conclusion: This marks a significant step in making quantum topological data analysis viable for practical use by integrating classical enhancement with quantum computation.

Abstract: Persistence diagrams serve as a core tool in topological data analysis, playing a crucial role in pathological monitoring, drug discovery, and materials design. However, existing quantum topological algorithms, such as the LGZ algorithm, can only efficiently compute summary statistics like Betti numbers, failing to provide persistence diagram information that tracks the lifecycle of individual topological features, severely limiting their practical value. This paper proposes a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that achieves, for the first time, the leap from "quantum computation of Betti numbers" to "quantum acquisition of practical persistence diagrams." The algorithm leverages the LGZ quantum algorithm as an efficient feature extractor, mining the harmonic form eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacian as well as Betti numbers, constructing specialized topological kernel functions to train a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and learning the mapping from quantum topological features to persistence diagrams. The core contributions of this algorithm are: (1) elevating quantum topological computation from statistical summaries to pattern recognition, greatly expanding its application value; (2) obtaining more practical topological information in the form of persistence diagrams for real-world applications while maintaining the exponential speedup advantage of quantum computation; (3) proposing a novel hybrid paradigm of "classical precision guiding quantum efficiency." This method provides a feasible pathway for the practical implementation of quantum topological data analysis.

Abstract: We investigate tensor network simulations of the two-dimensional Hubbard model by mapping the lattice onto a one-dimensional chain using space-filling curves. In particular, we focus on the Hilbert curve, whose locality-preserving structure minimizes the range of effective interactions in the mapped model. This enables a more compact matrix product state (MPS) representation compared to conventional snake mapping. Through systematic benchmarks, we show that the Hilbert curve consistently yields lower ground-state energies at fixed bond dimension, with the advantage increasing for larger system sizes and in physically relevant interaction regimes. Our implementation reaches clusters up to $32\times32$ sites with open and periodic boundary conditions, delivering reliable ground-state energies and correlation functions in agreement with established results, but at significantly reduced computational cost. These findings establish space-filling curve mappings, particularly the Hilbert curve, as a powerful tool for extending tensor-network studies of strongly correlated two-dimensional quantum systems beyond the limits accessible with standard approaches.

Abstract: The generation of high harmonics is a strongly nonlinear effect that allows to probe properties of the target and to study electron dynamics in matter. It has been investigated in many different kinds of targets, including molecular gases, liquids and solids. Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states.

TL;DR: We demonstrate PT-symmetry breaking in a many-body quantum system with a strong-interaction platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PT-symmetric non-Hermitian models are promising for creating open quantum systems with unique properties, such as enhanced precision in metrology or robust topological states. They have broad applications ranging from quantum optics to PT-symmetric analogs of the Kondo effect and the quantum spin Hall effect. To experimentally verify such mechanisms in a coherent platform is key.

Method: Used a trapped Rydberg-atom array, customized pulsed fields, engineered a non-Hermitian nearest-neighbor hopping with complex on-site potentials, and measured Loschmidt echo through an upgraded pump-probe setup.

Result: Observed PT-symmetry breaking in the many-body system, including the transition at finite N and non-monotonic LO decay with system size.

Conclusion: PT-symmetry breaking is a manifestation of non-Hermitian dynamics in open quantum systems and can be observed and controlled in a many-body interacting setting for applications in quantum information and simulation.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics with parity-time (PT) symmetry offers a powerful framework for exploring the complex interplay of dissipation and coherent interactions in open quantum systems. While PT-symmetry breaking has been studied in various physical systems, its observation on a quantum many-body level remains elusive. Here, we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian XY model in a strongly-interacting Rydberg-atom array. By measuring the Loschmidt Echo of a fully polarized state, we observe distinct dynamical signatures of a PT-symmetry-breaking phase transition. Dipole interactions are found to play a crucial role, not only determining the transition point but also triggering a non-Hermitian many-body blockade effect that protects the Loschmidt Echo from decay with a non-monotonic dependence on the system size. Our results reveal intricate interaction-induced effects on PT-symmetry breaking and open the door for exploring non-Hermitian many-body dynamics beyond single-particle and mean-field paradigms.

Abstract: Quantum computers and simulators offer unparalleled capabilities of probing quantum many-body states, by obtaining snapshots of the many-body wave function via collective projective measurements. The probability distribution obtained by such snapshots (which are fundamentally limited to a negligible fraction of the Hilbert space) is of fundamental importance to determine the power of quantum computations. However, its relation to many-body collective properties is poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to link quantum phases of matter to their snapshots, based on a combination of data complexity and network theory analyses. The first step in our scheme consists of applying Occam's razor principle to quantum sampling: given snapshots of a wave function, we identify a minimal-complexity measurement basis by analyzing the information compressibility of snapshots over different measurement bases. The second step consists of analyzing arbitrary correlations using network theory, building a wave-function network from the minimal-complexity basis data. This approach allows us to stochastically classify the output of quantum computers and simulations, with no assumptions on the underlying dynamics, and in a fully interpretable manner. We apply this method to quantum states of matter in one-dimensional translational invariant systems, where such classification is exhaustive, and where it reveals an interesting interplay between algorithmic and computational complexity for many-body states. Our framework is of immediate experimental relevance, and can be further extended both in terms of more advanced network mathematics, including discrete homology, as well as in terms of applications to physical phenomena, such as time-dependent dynamics and gauge theories.

Abstract: We propose Shuttling-based Distributed Quantum Computing (SDQC), a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of physical qubit shuttling and distributed quantum computing to enable scalable trapped-ion quantum computing. SDQC performs non-local quantum operations by distributing entangled ion qubits via deterministic shuttling, combining the high-fidelity and deterministic operations of shuttling-based architectures with the parallelism and pipelining advantages of distributed quantum computing. We present (1) a practical architecture incorporating quantum error correction (QEC), (2) pipelining strategies to exploit parallelism in entanglement distribution and measurement, and (3) a performance evaluation in terms of logical error rate and clock speed. For a 256-bit elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) instance, which requires 2,871 logical qubits at code distance 13, SDQC achieves a logical error rate which is $1.20^{+0.94}_{-0.45}\times10^{-8}$ of Photonic DQC error rate and $3.79^{+5.09}_{-2.84}\times10^{-3}$ of Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) error rate, while providing 2.82 times faster logical clock speed than QCCD.

### [50] [Quantum Advantage in Resource Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02131)
*William A. Simon,Peter J. Love*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper suggests a method to achieve practical quantum advantage by measuring simulation errors of Trotter-based quantum algorithms, which could reduce runtimes by three orders of magnitude for 100-qubit systems and increase with system size. The approach uses relatively few qubits and operations, making it feasible on the next generation of quantum computers. The task is a candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage because the resource estimates are infeasible for classical computers to compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstrating quantum advantage is crucial for showcasing the superiority of quantum computers over classical ones. This paper aims to provide a practical method to achieve this by focusing on measuring simulation errors, which could lead to significant runtime improvements.

Method: The authors propose a quantum algorithm to measure simulation errors of Trotter-based algorithms. The method involves quantum computations that are resource-intensive for classical counterparts but relatively lightweight for quantum systems.

Result: The results indicate that the proposed method could drastically reduce the runtime of quantum algorithms by three orders of magnitude for 100-qubit systems. Moreover, the efficiency of this reduction increases as the system size grows.

Conclusion: By leveraging quantum resource estimation, the paper presents a feasible path toward demonstrating practical quantum advantage, potentially marking a significant milestone in the development of quantum computing technology.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises the ability to compute properties of quantum systems exponentially faster than classical computers. Quantum advantage is achieved when a practical problem is solved more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. Demonstrating quantum advantage requires a powerful quantum computer with low error rates and an efficient quantum algorithm that has a useful application. Despite rapid progress in hardware development, we still lack useful applications that are feasible for the next generation of quantum computers. Here we argue that an exponential quantum advantage exists in producing numerical resource estimates of larger quantum algorithms by accurately measuring simulation errors. We provide a quantum algorithm for measuring simulation errors of Trotter-based algorithms. Our results indicate that this method will reduce runtimes of quantum algorithms by approximately three orders of magnitude for one-hundred qubit systems. We also predict that these reductions will increase with system size. The methods we propose require relatively few qubits and operations, meaning the next generation of quantum computers could compute simulation errors for classically intractable systems. Since the underlying computations that lead to reduced resource estimates are infeasible for classical computers, this task is a candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage.

Abstract: According to the ER = EPR conjecture, entangled particles are connected by quantum wormholes. Under the assumption that some of the electric field surrounding an entangled charged particle leaks into the wormhole, we show that this effect will modify the hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom. In addition, if the quantum wormholes are non-traversable, this will also lead to a non-zero total effective charge for the hydrogen atom. These effects provide strong constraints on the amplitude of this potential ER = EPR effect, given high-precision measurements of the hydrogen atom's hyperfine structure and total charge.

Abstract: I distinguish two senses in which one can take a given physical theory to be `complete'. On the first, a complete physical theory is one that, in principle, completely describes physical reality. On the second, a complete physical theory is one that provides all of the conceptual resources one needs to describe any (in general probabilistic) physical phenomenon to any level of detail one likes, in principle. I argue that while the (neo-)Everettian approach to interpreting quantum mechanics aims to show that it is complete in the first sense, the (neo-)Bohrian approach begins from an understanding of quantum mechanics as being complete in the second sense. I then discuss some of the essential differences between how classical and quantum theory describe phenomena, and the way in which the quantum description can be thought of as a ``natural generalisation'' (to use Bohr's phrase) of the classical description. Finally, I elaborate upon the two visions of physics from which one can motivate the first and the second sense of completeness, respectively: \emph{metaphysical realism}, on the one hand, and what I will call \emph{methodological realism}, on the other -- and discuss what one can say about the significance of the differences between quantum and classical description from each of these points of view. I suggest that there is a sense in which the views of (neo-)Everett and the views of (neo-)Bohr can be understood to be mutually supporting positions, from their respective perspectives, even though they are diametrically opposed.

### [53] [Absorption-Based Qubit Estimation in Discrete-Time Quantum Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02186)
*Edgard P. M. Amorim,Lorena R. Cerutti,O. P. de Sá Neto,M. C. de Oliveira*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  investigating state estimation in discrete-time quantum walks with an absorbing boundary, closed expressions for escape probability and classical Fisher information were derived. Boundary position's effect on information about the coin state was analyzed, emphasizing the complementarity between near and moderate boundaries. Combining two boundary placements provided full-rank Fisher information and precise Cramér-Rao bounds without requiring tomography. An integrated-photonics implementation was proposed, reducing configuration count compared to mode-resolved qubit tomography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work focuses on improving quantum metrology techniques, specifically in quantum walks. By understanding how particles escape from boundaries, it could lead to more efficient and scalable methods for quantum state measurements.

Method: The authors used a spectral approach to derive closed-form expressions for the escape probability and Fisher information. They compared single-copy quantum Fisher information with classical Fisher information from absorption readouts. A comprehensive analysis of boundary placements and their impact on information decoding was conducted. They proposed an integrated-photonics implementation, counting the reduction in configuration complexity.

Result: The results highlight that absorption in quantum walks can provide simple and scalable primitives for coin-state metrology. Combining two boundary placements yields optimal Fisher information with tight Cramér-Rao bounds. An integrated-photonics implementation is proposed, reducing the number of required configurations compared to mode-resolved qubit tomography.

Conclusion: This study shows that using multiple boundaries in quantum walks can enhance quantum metrology by capturing different aspects of the quantum state. The integrated-photonics approach suggests a practical path for implementing scalable quantum sensors without the complexity of full mode-resolved qubit tomography.

Abstract: We investigate state estimation in discrete-time quantum walks with a single absorbing boundary. Using a spectral approach, we obtain closed expressions for the escape probability as a function of the coin state and the boundary position, and their corresponding classical Fisher information for a simple absorption readout. Comparing with the single-copy quantum Fisher information shows a clear complementarity: near boundaries carry broad information about the population angle of the coin, whereas moderate or distant boundaries reveal phase-sensitive regions. Because a single boundary probes only one information direction, combining two boundary placements yields a full-rank Fisher matrix and tight joint Cramér--Rao bounds, while retaining a binary, tomography-free measurement. We outline an integrated-photonics implementation in which an on-chip sink realizes the absorber and estimate a substantial reduction in configuration count compared to mode-resolved qubit tomography. These results identify absorption in quantum walks as a simple and scalable primitive for coin-state metrology.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement offers powerful opportunities for enhancing measurement sensitivity beyond classical limits, with optical atomic clocks serving as a leading platform for such advances. This chapter introduces the principles of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology and explores their applications to timekeeping. We review the theoretical framework of quantum phase estimation, comparing frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and discuss paradigmatic entangled states such as spin-squeezed and GHZ states. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges posed by decoherence, which constrain the practical advantages that can be realized in large-scale devices. The discussion then turns to frequency estimation in atomic clocks, highlighting how experimental constraints shape the translation of abstract quantum limits into real performance gains. Finally, we outline emerging directions of contemporary quantum metrology. Together, these developments underscore the increasingly close interplay between quantum information processing and precision metrology.

Motivation: 随着量子技术的应用需求增加，Spintronic和量子传感领域的研究陷于快速发展。

Method: 在4H-SiC晶格中引入二价空位（V2）缺陷区域，通过低温等离子体激发这些缺陷。

Result: 首次实现利用低温等离子体获取高对比度的自旋探测。实验结果显示，使用低功率激光达到50%的对比度，且灵敏度达到100nT/sqrt(Hz)，表现为将传统方法所需功耗减少10倍。

Conclusion: 这种方法为量子传感提供了更优的选择。

Abstract: The V2 silicon vacancy defect in 4H-SiC has emerged as a promising system for quantum technologies due to its favorable optical and spin properties and the advantages of the SiC host. However, the readout contrast - an important benchmark for quantum sensing - of V2 ensembles for optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is relatively low, usually <1$\%$ at room temperature. To overcome this challenge, we resonantly excite the V2 ensembles at cryogenic temperatures and compare the results with the off-resonant case. We report a maximum ODMR contrast of 50$\%$ with only 2 $μ$W of resonant laser power, almost 100 times improvement over off-resonant excitation. We attribute this high readout contrast to a subset of V2 centers that have one spin-selective optical transition resonant with the laser. The ODMR contrast decreases with temperature, approaching the non-resonant contrast by 60 K, likely due to broadening of the optical transition linewidths. We achieve a maximum sensitivity of 100 nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ with a resonant laser power of 300 $μ$W, while 100 times more non-resonant excitation power is needed to achieve comparable sensitivity.

Motivation: 理解量子力学中态的演化和概率分布的动态变化对于研究散射过程和粒子行为非常重要。

Result: 在散射过程中，初始状态通过连续参数描述，随着时间的演进转为离散的特征态集合，每个特征态具有对应的概率和时间演变的波函数。研究发现，一维高斯波包在长时间下，特征值接近传输和反射概率，对应的特征态为单峰反射或传输态；剩余的小特征值随着时间的推移，其概率分布逐渐变得复杂，呈现多峰态。对于二维情况，同样特征值的大小与概率的分布峰数相关，即单峰对应传输或反射，多峰对应多态的叠加。

Conclusion: 此研究揭示了量子散射过程中状态的从连续到离散的演变更具体过程，为量子力学中态的演化提供了新的视角。

Abstract: A particle initially in a pure state but interacting with some environment evolves into a discrete ensemble of pure states, the eigenstates of its reduced density operator, with ensemble probabilities given by the corresponding eigenvalues. In this work, we use numerics to present explicit results for the time-dependence of these eigenvalues and eigenstates for simple scattering experiments in one and two dimensions. This provides a time-resolved picture of the scattering process, showing in detail how an initial state described entirely in terms of continuous parameters evolves into a discrete set of possible outcomes, each with an associated probability and time-evolving wavefunction. We find that for scattering of Gaussian wavepackets in one dimension, the late time spectrum is dominated by two large eigenvalues nearly equal to the transmission and reflection probabilities associated with the central value of momentum. The corresponding eigenstates appear as single-peaked reflected or transmitted wavepackets. The remaining smaller eigenvalues, which increase to a maximum during scattering and then decrease to small values, correspond to reflected or transmitted wavepackets with multiple spatially separated parts. In this case and also for two-dimensional scattering, we find that successively smaller eigenvalues correspond to probability distributions with successively more peaks. These multi-peaked states correspond to outcomes of the scattering experiment where a particle initially in a single wavepacket ends up in a superposition of separated wavepackets after scattering.

Abstract: Circulators are nonreciprocal devices that enable directional signal routing. Nonreciprocity, which requires time-reversal symmetry breaking, can be produced in waveguides in which the propagation medium moves relative to the waveguide at a moderate fraction of the wave speed. Motivated by this effect, here we propose a design for nonreciprocal microwave transmission based on an extended, annular Josephson junction, in which the propagation medium consists of a train of moving fluxons. We show how to harness this to build a high-quality resonant microwave circulator, and we theoretically evaluate the anticipated performance of such a device.

Abstract: The prevailing view is that quantum phenomena can be harnessed to tackle certain problems beyond the reach of classical approaches. Quantifying this capability as a quantum-classical separation and demonstrating it on current quantum processors has remained elusive. Using a superconducting qubit processor, we show that quantum contextuality enables certain tasks to be performed with success probabilities beyond classical limits. With a few qubits, we illustrate quantum contextuality with the magic square game, as well as quantify it through a Kochen--Specker--Bell inequality violation. To examine many-body contextuality, we implement the N-player GHZ game and separately solve a 2D hidden linear function problem, exceeding classical success rate in both. Our work proposes novel ways to benchmark quantum processors using contextuality-based algorithms.

Abstract: This work unifies the equilibrium and non-equilibrium frameworks of quantum metrology within the context of many-body systems. We investigate dynamic sensing schemes to derive an upper bound on the quantum Fisher information for probe states in thermal equilibrium with their environment. We establish that the dynamic quantum Fisher information for a thermal probe state is upper bounded by the degree of non-commutation between the transformed local generator and the Hamiltonian for the thermal state. Furthermore, we show that this upper bound scales as the square of the product of the inverse temperature and the evolution time. In the low-temperature limit, we establish an additional upper bound expressed as the seminorm of the commutator divided by the energy gap. We apply this thermal dynamic sensing scheme to various models, demonstrating that the dynamic quantum Fisher information satisfies the established upper bounds.

Abstract: Simulating large quantum circuits on hardware with limited qubit counts is often attempted through methods like circuit knitting, which typically incur sample costs that grow exponentially with the number of connections cut. In this work, we introduce a framework based on Cluster-level Light-cone analysis that leverages the natural locality of quantum workloads. We propose two complementary algorithms: the Causal Decoupling Algorithm, which exploits geometric disconnections in the light cone for sampling efficiency, and the Algebraic Decomposition Algorithm, which utilizes algebraic expansion to minimize hardware requirements. These methods allow simulation costs to depend on circuit depth and connectivity rather than system size. Together, our results generalize Lieb-Robinson-inspired locality to modular architectures and establish a quantitative framework for probing local physics on near-term quantum devices by decoupling the simulation cost from the global system size.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds the promise of enhancing machine learning modeling in terms of both complexity and accuracy. A key challenge in this domain is the encoding of input data, which plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of QML models. In this work, we tackle a largely unaddressed aspect of encoding that is unique to QML modeling -- rather than adjusting the ansatz used for encoding, we consider adjusting how data is conveyed to the ansatz. We specifically implement QML pipelines that leverage classical data manipulation (i.e., ordering, selecting, and weighting features) as a preprocessing step, and evaluate if these aspects of encoding can have a significant impact on QML model performance, and if they can be effectively optimized to improve performance. Our experimental results, applied across a wide variety of data sets, ansatz, and circuit sizes, with a representative QML approach, demonstrate that by optimizing how features are encoded in an ansatz we can substantially and consistently improve the performance of QML models, making a compelling case for integrating these techniques in future QML applications. Finally we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this approach by running it using real quantum hardware with 100 qubit circuits and successfully achieving improved QML modeling performance in this case as well.

### [62] [Quantum-Based Self-Attention Mechanism for Hardware-Aware Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02476)
*Yuxiang Liu,Sixuan Li,Fanxu Meng,Zaichen Zhang,Xutao Yu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A novel differentiable quantum architecture search framework, QBSA-DQAS, is developed for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Quantum-based self-attention and hardware-aware multi-objective optimization replace classical methods; experiments show significant improvements for variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) and wireless sensor network routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era demands practical quantum algorithms that can handle hardware noise and limitations. Existing methods often fail to adapt well to these challenges, necessitating a new approach that accounts for quantum noise in the architecture search process.

Method: QBSA-DQAS employs a two-stage quantum self-attention mechanism to evaluate architectural parameters and a hardware-aware multi-objective function to optimize both noise resilience and success probability. The framework also includes post-search optimization techniques like gate commutation and elimination to reduce circuit complexity.

Result: The framework achieves significant performance gains. For VQE on hydrogen molecules, it improves accuracy by up to 1% compared to standard methods. Post-search optimizations reduce circuit complexity by 44-47% without compromising accuracy or performance in wireless sensor networks.

Conclusion: QBSA-DQAS represents a breakthrough in quantum-native architecture search, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for optimizing quantum circuits in the NISQ era, demonstrating clear advantages in both accuracy and resource efficiency over existing methods.

Abstract: The automated design of parameterized quantum circuits for variational algorithms in the NISQ era faces a fundamental limitation, as conventional differentiable architecture search relies on classical models that fail to adequately represent quantum gate interactions under hardware noise. We introduce the Quantum-Based Self-Attention for Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (QBSA-DQAS), a meta-learning framework featuring quantum-based self-attention and hardware-aware multi-objective search. The framework employs a two-stage quantum self-attention module that computes contextual dependencies by mapping architectural parameters through parameterized quantum circuits, replacing classical similarity metrics with quantum-derived attention scores, then applies position-wise quantum transformations for feature enrichment. Architecture search is guided by a task-agnostic multi-objective function jointly optimizing noisy expressibility and Probability of Successful Trials (PST). A post-search optimization stage applies gate commutation, fusion, and elimination to reduce circuit complexity. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance on VQE tasks and large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks. For VQE on H$_2$, QBSA-DQAS achieves 0.9 accuracy compared to 0.89 for standard DQAS. Post-search optimization reduces discovered circuit complexity by up to 44% in gate count and 47% in depth without accuracy degradation. The framework maintains robust performance across three molecules and five IBM quantum hardware noise models. For WSN routing, discovered circuits achieve 8.6% energy reduction versus QAOA and 40.7% versus classical greedy methods, establishing the effectiveness of quantum-native architecture search for NISQ applications.

Conclusion: 该研究证实了量子计算在近感兴趣的硬件环境下研究共性和复数量子现象的潜力。

Abstract: The transverse-field Ising model serves as a paradigm for studying confinement and excitation spectra, particularly the emergence of $E_8$ symmetry near criticality. However, experimentally resolving the Ising meson spectroscopy required to verify these symmetries is challenging on near-term quantum hardware due to the depth of circuits required for real-time evolution. Here, we demonstrate improved spectroscopy of confined excitations using two distinct error-resilient circuit construction techniques on the IBM Torino device: first-order Trotter decomposition utilizing native fractional gates, and a tensor-network-based circuit compression via Riemannian optimization. By analyzing the Fourier spectrum of error-mitigated time-series data, we successfully identify key signatures of $E_8$ symmetry despite hardware noise. These results validate the viability of both circuit compression and hardware-efficient compilation for probing complex topological phenomena on NISQ devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the following simple scenario: Alice has one of many possible messages, drawn from a known distribution, and wants to maximize the probability that Bob guesses her message correctly. We prove that if Alice can send only a qudit to Bob, without preshared entanglement, there is never any advantage over sending him a classical dit. This result was previously known only for a uniform distribution.
  We also prove a mixed-state generalization of this result in the form of an upper bound on the success probability of discriminating between mixed quantum states with a single measurement. This bound is based solely on the dimension, probability distribution, and eigenvalues of the states and is sharp among such bounds.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Evidence of non-hermitian behavior has been recently demonstrated in cavity magnonics, including the emergence of mode level attraction and exceptional points in spectroscopic measurements. This work demonstrates experimental evidence of time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems that are coupled through a long-range interaction (i.e. remote coupling) exhibiting level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode. We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics. Our approach offers in situ tunability over the dissipative coupling strength, including complete suppression, without requiring physical modifications to the experimental setup, providing a versatile platform for exploring tunable, non-Hermitian physics.

Conclusion: 该框架为分析和实现量子动态提供了一个系统的方法，并扩展了超通道的理论框架。

Abstract: Quantum channels function as the operational primitives of quantum theory, while superchannels describe the most general transformations acting upon them. Yet the prevailing framework for superchannels is both internally inconsistent, owing to the coexistence of distinct Choi operator constructions, and structurally incomplete, lacking the analogue of representations that ground channel theory. We resolve these issues by combining tensor-network methods with a generalized Occam's razor introduced here, establishing a unified foundation for superchannels. Our framework establishes the connections between competing Choi formulations, develops the Kraus, Stinespring, and Liouville representations for superchannels, and provides a simplified derivation of the realization theorem that identifies the minimal memory required to implement a given transformation. These structural tools also enable characterizations of superchannels that destroy quantum correlations or causal structure, opening a systematic route to non-Markovian quantum dynamics.

Abstract: The Phononic Casimir effect between planar objects is investigated by deriving a formalism from the quantum partition function of the system following multiscattering approach. This fluctuation-induced coupling is mediated by phonons modeled as an effective elastic medium. We find that excitations with three types of polarizations arise from the resolved boundary conditions, however the coupling is dominated by only one of these degrees of freedom due to exponential suppression effects in the other two. The obtained scaling laws and dependence on materials properties and temperature suggest effective pathways of interaction control. Scenarios of materials combinations are envisioned where the Phononic Casimir effect is of similar order as the standard Casimir interaction mediated by electromagnetic fluctuations.

Conclusion: Z2对称性在开量子动力学中起关键作用，不同环境干扰下系统的分裂相由测量和相干性共同控制。

Abstract: We investigate the steady-state phases of generic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric monitored, open quantum dynamics. We describe the phases systematically in terms of both information-theoretic diagnostics and spontaneous breaking of strong and weak symmetries of the dynamics. We find a completely broken phase where information is retained by the quantum system, a strong-to-weak broken phase where information is leaked to the environment, and an unbroken phase where information is learned by the observer. We find that weak measurement and dephasing alone constitute a minimal model for generic open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, but we also explore perturbations by unitary gates. For a 1d set of qubits, we examine information-theoretic and symmetry-breaking observables in the path integral of the doubled state. This path integral reduces to the standard classical 2d random-bond Ising model in certain limits but generically involves negative weights, enabling a special self-dual random-bond Ising model at the critical point when only measurements are present. We obtain numerical evidence for the steady-state phases using efficient tensor network simulations of the doubled state.

Abstract: Motivated by the importance of dispersive readout in quantum technology, we study a prototypical dispersive readout setup that is probed by a squeezed vacuum in a time-reversal-symmetric fashion. To this end, we develop a full-counting-statistics framework for dispersive readout and analyze its measurement information, accompanied by a generalized mean-field approach suitable to deal with non-unitary dynamics. Distinct from conventional input-output theory, our full-counting-statistics approach enables the direct calculation of arbitrary-order cumulants for the measured cumulative (i.e., time-integrated) photonic distribution while maintaining applicability to nonlinear systems. The corresponding Fisher information exhibits an exponential dependence on the squeezing parameter and a robustness against residual nonlinearity, which can even approach the quantum Fisher information, setting an upper limit. This work introduces a conceptually streamlined and computationally efficient framework for continuous quantum measurements, making it well suited for widespread adoption in quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 这项研究通过全局优化的方法显著提高了解码器的虚拟化效率，为大规模量子计算提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) requires fast and accurate decoding of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) syndromes. However, in large-scale systems, the number of available decoders is much smaller than the number of logical qubits, leading to a fundamental resource shortage. To address this limitation, Virtualized Quantum Decoder (VQD) architectures have been proposed to share a limited pool of decoders across multiple qubits. While the Minimize Longest Undecoded Sequence (MLS) heuristic has been introduced as an effective scheduling policy within the VQD framework, its locally greedy decision-making structure limits its ability to consider global circuit structure, causing inefficiencies in resource balancing and limited scalability. In this work, we propose Constraint-Optimal Driven Allocation (CODA), an optimization-based scheduling algorithm that leverages global circuit structure to minimize the longest undecoded sequence length. Across 19 benchmark circuits, CODA achieves an average 74\% reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length. Crucially, while the theoretical search space scales exponentially with circuit size, CODA effectively bypasses this combinatorial explosion. Our evaluation confirms that the scheduling time scales linearly with the number of qubits, determined by physical resource constraints rather than the combinatorial search space, ensuring robust scalability for large-scale FTQC systems. These results demonstrate that CODA provides a global optimization-based, scalable scheduling solution that enables efficient decoder virtualization in large-scale FTQC systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-Gaussian states are essential for quantum technologies, but their generation is challenging. This paper addresses this issue.

Method: The framework uses Gaussian inputs, optical parametric amplification, and heralded photon detection to generate various non-Gaussian states.

Result: The framework successfully generates photon-added squeezed states, cubic-phase-like states, and squeezed-cat states with high fidelities, providing a scalable platform for quantum applications.

Conclusion: This work offers a practical solution for implementing non-Gaussian states, advancing quantum technologies.

Abstract: Quantum technologies, encompassing communication, computation, and metrology, rely on the generation and control of non-Gaussian states of light. These states enable secure quantum communication, fault-tolerant quantum computation, and precision sensing beyond classical limits, yet their practical realisation remains a major challenge due to reliance on high-photon-number Fock states or strong non-linearities. Here we introduce a unified optical framework that removes this constraint, using only Gaussian inputs, optical parametric amplification, and heralded photon detection. Within a single architecture, we demonstrate the generation of photon-added squeezed states with near unit fidelity, cubic-phase-like states with strong non-linearities and fidelities above 98.5%, and squeezed-cat states exceeding 99% fidelity that can be iteratively bred into GKP grid states surpassing the 9.75 dB fault-tolerance threshold. Operating entirely below 3 dB of input squeezing, the approach provides a scalable, experimentally accessible platform that unites the state resources required for quantum communication, metrology, and computation within one coherent optical framework.

Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most promising platforms for realizing a large-scale quantum information processor. Current progress focuses on integrating optical and electronic components into microfabricated ion traps to allow scaling to large numbers of ion qubits. Most available fabrication strategies for such integrated processors employ monolithic integration of all processor components and rely heavily on CMOS-compatible semiconductor fabrication technologies that are not optimized for the requirements of a trapped-ion quantum processor. In this work, we present a modular approach in which the processor modules, called chiplets, have specific functions and are fabricated separately. The individual chiplets are then combined using heterogeneous integration techniques. This strategy opens up the possibility of choosing the optimal materials and fabrication technology for each of the chiplets, with a minimum amount of fabrication limitations compared to the monolithic approach. Chiplet technology furthermore enables novel processor functionalities to be added in a cost-effective, modular fashion by adding or modifying only a subset of the chiplets. We describe the design concept of a chiplet-based trapped-ion quantum processor and demonstrate the technology with an example of an integrated individual-ion addressing system for a ten-ion crystal. The addressing system emphasizes the modularity of the chiplet approach, combining a surface ion trap manufactured on a glass substrate with a silicon substrate carrying integrated waveguides and a stack of 3D-printed micro-optics, achieving diffraction-limited focal spots at the ion positions.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers unconditional information security by allowing two distant users to establish a common encryption key resilient to hacking. Resultingly, QKD networks interconnecting critical infrastructure and enabling the secure exchange of classified information, can provide a solution to the increasing number of successful cyberattacks. To efficiently deploy quantum networks, the technology must be integrated over existing communication infrastructure, such as optical fibre links. Yet, QKD poses stringent requirements on the conditions of the network over which it is deployed. This work demonstrates the first quantum communication network in Cyprus via the deployment of a multi-node quantum network, exploiting existing commercial underground optical fibre. The network employs bidirectional occupation of fibres and wavelength multiplexing in a ring architecture to achieve, with minimal use of dark fibres, high-rate QKD. Results obtained reveal consistent key generation rates across all nodes, confirming reliable operation in a real-world environment. This deployment highlights the feasibility of leveraging existing telecom infrastructure for quantum-secured communication, marking a significant step toward scalable and cost-effective quantum networks suited for critical applications.

Abstract: Born-rule generative modeling, a central task in quantum machine learning, seeks to learn probability distributions that can be efficiently sampled by measuring complex quantum states. One hope is for quantum models to efficiently capture probability distributions that are difficult to learn and simulate by classical means alone. Quantum Boltzmann machines were proposed about one decade ago for this purpose, yet efficient training methods have remained elusive. In this paper, I overcome this obstacle by proposing a practical solution that trains quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling. Two key ingredients in the proposal are the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of the classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator of [Patel et al., arXiv:2410.12935]. I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution. I also show how to extend the findings to other distinguishability measures beyond relative entropy. Finally, I present four different hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for the minimax optimization underlying training, and I discuss their theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Understanding and classifying multipartite entanglement is fundamental to quantum information processing. A useful measure of multipartite entanglement is the minimal decomposition entropy, defined as the minimum of the Rényi entropy $ S_q $ associated with the state's decomposition over all local product bases. This quantity identifies the product bases in which the state is maximally localized, thereby yielding optimal representations for analyzing local-unitary equivalence and structural properties of multipartite states.
  We investigate the minimal decomposition entropy for absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states, a class of highly entangled states characterized by their maximal entanglement across any bipartitions. We present a numerical algorithm for computing the minimal decomposition entropy for finite $ q>1 $. Entropy distributions for AME and Haar random states are obtained for $ q=2 $ and $ q=\infty $ in qubit, qutrit, and ququad systems. For $ q=2 $, AME states of four qutrits and four ququads exhibit smaller minimal decomposition entropy than Haar random states, indicating more localized optimal representations. For $ q=\infty $, corresponding to the geometric measure of entanglement, AME states display higher entanglement than Haar random states. The algorithm additionally produces simpler and sparser decompositions of known AME states, aiding in distinguishing genuinely quantum AME states from those associated with classical combinatorial designs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation traditionally incurs substantial resource overhead, with both qubit and time overheads scaling polylogarithmically with the size of the computation. While prior work by Gottesman showed that constant qubit overhead is achievable under stochastic noise using quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, it has remained an open question whether similar guarantees hold under more general, non-stochastic noise models. In this work, we address this question by considering a general circuit-level noise model defined via the diamond norm, which captures both stochastic and non-stochastic noise, including coherent and amplitude damping noise. We prove that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable in this general setting, using QLDPC codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. To establish our result, we develop a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise. These results extend the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and offer new directions for fault-tolerant architectures under realistic noise models.

Abstract: We study the robustness of topological ground state degeneracy to long-range interactions in quantum many-body systems. We focus on slowly decaying two-body interactions that scale like a power-law $1/r^α$ where $α$ is smaller than the spatial dimension; such interactions are beyond the reach of known stability theorems which only apply to short-range or rapidly decaying long-range perturbations. Our main result is a computation of the ground state splitting of several toy models, which are variants of the 1D Ising model $H = -\sum_i σ^z_i σ^z_{i+1} + λ\sum_{ij} |i-j|^{-α} σ^x_i σ^x_j$ with $λ> 0$ and $α< 1$. These models are also closely connected to the Kitaev p-wave wire model with power-law density-density interactions. In these examples, we find that the splitting $δ$ scales like a stretched exponential $δ\sim \exp(-C L^{\frac{1+α}{2}})$ where $L$ is the system size. Our computations are based on path integral techniques similar to the instanton method introduced by Coleman. We also study another toy model with long-range interactions that can be analyzed without path integral techniques and that shows similar behavior.

Abstract: Quantum voting, inspired by quantum game theory, provides a framework in which the quantum majority rule (QMR) constitution of Bao and Yunger Halpern [Phys. Rev. A 95, 062306 (2017)] violates the quantum analogue of Arrow's impossibility theorem. We evaluate this QMR constitution analytically on classical profile data and implement its final measurement stage as a quantum circuit, running on both noiseless simulators and noisy IBM quantum hardware to map how realistic noise deforms the resulting societal ranking distribution. Moderate-high single-qubit noise does not change the qualitative behavior of QMR, whereas strong noise shifts the distribution toward other dominant winners than the classical one. We quantify this behavior using winner-agreement rates, Condorcet-winner flip rates, and Jensen-Shannon divergence between societal ranking distributions. In a second, exploratory component, we demonstrate an explicitly entanglement-based variant of the QMR constitution that serves as a testbed for multi-voter quantum correlations under noise, which we refer to as the QMR2-inspired variant. There, GHZ-type and separable superpositions over opposite rankings have the same expectation values but respond very differently to noise. Taken together, these two components connect the abstract QMR constitution to concrete implementations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and highlight design considerations for future quantum voting protocols.

Abstract: The transition from the quantum to the classical realm remains one of the most profound open questions in physics. While quantum theory predicts the existence of macroscopic superpositions, their apparent absence in the everyday world is attributed either to environmental decoherence or to an intrinsic mechanism for wave-function collapse. This work presents a quantitative and experimentally grounded framework for distinguishing these possibilities. We propose a levitated optomechanical platform capable of generating controllable Schrodinger-cat states in the center of mass motion of a dielectric nanosphere. A comprehensive master equation incorporates gas collisions, black-body radiation, and photon-recoil noise, establishing a calibrated environmental baseline. The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model is embedded within the same framework, predicting a characteristic saturation of the decoherence rate with superposition size and a quadratic scaling with mass. A Bayesian inference protocol is outlined to discriminate collapse induced excess decoherence from environmental noise. Together these elements provide a concrete experimental blueprint for a decisive test of quantum linearity, either revealing new physics beyond standard quantum mechanics or setting the most stringent bounds to date on objective-collapse parameters.

Abstract: We study the problem of data transmission under the influence of a jammer, which is typical for wireless systems and commonly modeled as an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) in information theory. AVC fulfilling a certain set of linear equations are called symmetrizable and are known to be prone to denial of service attacks. Recent work has shown that deciding if a given AVC is symmetrizable or not is a non-Turing computable problem. By relaxing the formulation of symmetrizability, we show the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm that determines whether a given AVC is non-symmetrizable, but displays a critical dependence on the number of jammer input states. We then show how imposing an energy constraint on the jammer allows the same algorithm to efficiently identify large classes of AVCs which are non-symmetrizable.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning algorithms have very recently attracted significant attention in photonic platforms. In particular, reconfigurable integrated photonic circuits offer a promising route, thanks to the possibility of implementing adaptive feedback loops, which is an essential ingredient for achieving the necessary nonlinear behavior characteristic of neural networks. Here, we implement a quantum reservoir computing protocol in which information is processed through a reconfigurable linear optical integrated photonic circuit and measured using single-photon detectors. We exploit a multiphoton-based setup for time-series forecasting tasks in a variety of scenarios, where the input signal is encoded in one of the circuit's optical phases, thus modulating the quantum reservoir state. The resulting output probabilities are used to set the feedback phases and, at the end of the computation, are fed to a classical digital layer trained via linear regression to perform predictions. We then focus on the investigation of the role of input photon indistinguishability in the reservoir's capabilities of predicting time-series. We experimentally demonstrate that two-photon indistinguishable input states lead to significantly better performance compared to distinguishable ones. This enhancement arises from the quantum correlations present in indistinguishable states, which enable the system to approximate higher-order nonlinear functions when using comparable physical resources, highlighting the importance of quantum interference and indistinguishability as a resource in photonic quantum reservoir computing.

### [84] [Stability of quantum chaos against weak non-unitarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02934)
*Yi-Cheng Wang,Ehud Altman,Samuel J. Garratt*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates purification dynamics in quantum systems with fixed evolution operators. When using random unitaries, purification occurs on a time linear in system size, while non-unitary single-qubit operations are slow, taking exponential time. The eigenvalue distribution of the evolution operator forms rings with sharp edges, causing slow purification. Level repulsion around the ring persists even near the edges, indicating correlation with quantum chaos levels, where entropy growth slows initially before linear growth. Our results suggest designing slow scrambling requires specific operator choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of quantum systems, particularly how and when information is lost or preserved, is crucial for quantum computing and information theory. This paper bridges abstract operator analysis with practical implications in quantum dynamics.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis of evolution operators, eigenvalue distributions, and spectral techniques such as the spectral form factor for level spacing analysis. The research uses methods from random matrix theory and spectral graph theory to examine the evolution of quantum states over time.

Result: The paper identifies conditions under which purification of quantum states is slow, specifically when evolution operators have eigenvalue distributions forming rings in the complex plane with specific edge behaviors. This finding connects the structure of the evolution operator's spectrum to the system's sensitivity and scrambling capabilities.

Conclusion: The research contributes to the understanding of quantum dynamics by linking spectral properties of evolution operators to the behavior of purification and scrambling. The findings are foundational for designing quantum systems with desired operational characteristics, such as error correction and information scrambling.

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by the repeated action of a non-unitary evolution operator on a system of qubits. Breaking unitarity can lead to the purification of mixed initial states, which corresponds to the loss of sensitivity to initial conditions, and hence the absence of a key signature of dynamical chaos. However, the scrambling of quantum information can delay purification to times that are exponential in system size. Here we study purification in systems whose evolution operators are fixed in time, where all aspects of the dynamics are in principle encoded in spectral properties of the evolution operator for a single time step. The operators that we study consist of global Haar random unitary operators and non-unitary single-qubit operations. We show that exponentially slow purification arises from a distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane that forms a ring with sharp edges at large radii, with the eigenvalue density exponentially large near these edges. We argue that the sharp edges of the eigenvalue distribution arise from level attraction along the radial direction in the complex plane. By calculating the spectral form factor we also show that there is level repulsion around the azimuthal direction, even close to the outer edge of the ring of eigenvalues. Our results connect this spectral signature of quantum chaos to the sensitivity of the system to its initial conditions.

Abstract: We propose a novel heuristic quantum algorithm for the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem based on continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs). In this framework, the coherent propagation of a quantum walker over a graph encodes its structural properties into state amplitudes, enabling the identification of highly influential vertices through their transition probabilities. To enhance stability and solution quality, we introduce a dynamic decoupling (``freezing'') mechanism that isolates vertices already selected for the cover, preventing their interference in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. The method employs a compact binary encoding, requiring only $\lceil \log_2 (V)\rceil$ qubits to represent a graph with $V$ vertices, resulting in an exponential reduction of quantum resources compared to conventional vertex-based encodings. We benchmark the proposed heuristic against exact solutions obtained via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and against established classical heuristics, including Simulated Annealing, FastVC, and the 2-Approximation algorithm, across Erdős--Rényi, Barabási--Albert and regular random graph ensembles. Our results demonstrate that the CTQW-based heuristic consistently achieves superior approximation ratios and exhibits remarkable robustness with respect to network topology, outperforming classical approaches in both heterogeneous and homogeneous structures. These findings indicate that continuous-time quantum walks, when combined with topology-independent decoupling strategies, provide a powerful paradigm for large-scale combinatorial optimization and complex network control, with potential applications spanning infrastructure resilience, epidemic containment, sensor network optimization, and biological systems analysis.

Abstract: Multipartite quantum states saturating the Heisenberg limit of sensitivity typically require full-body correlators to be prepared. On the other hand, experimentally practical Hamiltonians often involve few-body correlators only. Here, we study the metrological performances under this constraint, using tools derived from the quantum Fisher information. Our work applies to any encoding generator, also including a dependence on the parameter. We find that typical random symmetric ground states of $k$-body permutation-invariant Hamiltonians exhibit Heisenberg scaling. Finally, we establish a tradeoff between the Hamiltonian's gap, which quantifies preparation hardness, and the quantum Fisher information of the corresponding ground state.

*Asim Sharma,Avah Banerjee*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how derandomized Clifford+T circuits with causal connections can exhibit quantum chaos and unitary T-design behavior. Through various architectures, including random Clifford circuits with bitonic sorting networks and permutation-based routing, they achieve Wigner-Dyson statistics and OTOC decay, suggesting that causal connectivity is key. They show that OTOC decay and WD statistics can be achieved with polylog-depth circuits, meaning deterministic constructions can produce chaotic behavior even with limited circuit depth. This is important because it highlights that, for constructing digital quantum devices and studying chaos and pseudorandomness, the networks need to have causal connections to drive behavior, rather than relying on randomness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performing high-fidelity quantum computation across diverse quantum hardware platforms requires quantum systems with deterministic behaviors that can exhibit chaotic behavior. This paper is motivated by the need for such constructions in the quantum computing field, where understanding and controlling chaotic behavior is crucial for device construction and operational pseudorandomness.

Method: The approach taken by this paper is a combination of theoretical analysis, simulation, and experiment. They start by defining derandomized Clifford+T circuits with causal connections and experimentally validate their behavior using computer simulation and numerical experiments. This mix of theoretical and experimental methods allows for a thorough validation of their hypothesis about the role of causal connectivity in inducing quantum chaos.

Result: The results show that (1) the depth and randomness of quantum circuits do not significantly affect the emergence of quantum chaos, (2) instead, it is crucial for the quantum circuit architectures to have causal connections, and (3) they can achieve quantum chaos and unitary T-design behavior even with polylogarithmic depths and without randomness.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that causal connectivity is a key factor in driving quantum chaos and unitary T-design behavior in Clifford+T quantum circuits. It provides evidence that polylog-depth, deterministic quantum circuits with causal connectivity can achieve complex quantum behavior. This has important implications for the design of quantum devices and for understanding chaos and pseudorandomness in quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum chaos and unitary T-design behavior in derandomized Clifford+T circuits using causal cover architectures. Motivated by the need for deterministic constructions that can exhibit chaotic behavior across diverse quantum hardware platforms, we explore deterministic Clifford circuit architectures (random Clifford circuits with causal cover, bitonic sorting networks, and permutation-based routing circuits) to drive quantum circuits toward Wigner-Dyson (WD) entanglement spectrum statistics and OTOC decay.Our experiments demonstrate that causal connectivity, not circuit depth or randomness, is a critical feature that drives circuits to chaos. We show that initializing with n T-states and adding a second T-layer after a causally covered Clifford evolution yields consistent OTOC decay and WD statistics. This also enables deeper understanding of the circuit structures that generate complex entanglement behavior. Notably, our work suggests polylogarithmic-depth deterministic circuits suffice to approximate chaotic behavior, highlighting that causal connectivity is sufficient for operator spreading to induce Wigner-Dyson entanglement statistics and OTOC decay.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that Z^2 is geodesically directable, enabling construction of exactly-solvable chaotic local quantum circuits with non-trivial correlations on 2D Euclidean lattices, including regular tilings. The authors introduce geodesic slices and bounded extensions as tools to achieve this. Motivation stems from quantum circuit design with desirable properties. Method involves defining graph extensions and analyzing geodesic properties. Results establish Z^2’s directability, leading to broader implications. Conclusion: These findings provide a new avenue for designing quantum circuits with predictable behavior on periodic lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers are motivated by the need for new methods in quantum circuit design, particularly seeking exactly-solvable models with chaotic yet controllable behavior on 2D lattices.

Method: The researchers define the concept of a graph's extension and analyze its geodesic properties. They introduce the term 'geodesic slice' to describe subsets of vertices along geodesics at specific distances, demonstrating uniform bounds on these slices for Z^2 graphs.

Result: The main result is the demonstration that the Z^2 lattice is geodesically directable. This implies that any bounded extension of Z^2 also possesses this property, leading to the conclusion that all regular two-dimensional tilings are geodesically directable.

Conclusion: The study contributes novel methods for analyzing and constructing quantum circuits with defined geodesic properties. By proving that Z^2 and related graphs can be geodesically directable, this opens new possibilities for designing quantum systems with predictable chaotic behavior.

Abstract: We investigate a graph-theoretic problem motivated by questions in quantum computing concerning the propagation of information in quantum circuits. A graph $G$ is said to be a bounded extension of its subgraph $L$ if they share the same vertex set, and the graph distance $d_L(u, v)$ is uniformly bounded for edges $uv\in G$. Given vertices $u, v$ in $G$ and an integer $k$, the geodesic slice $S(u, v, k)$ denotes the subset of vertices $w$ lying on a geodesic in $G$ between $u$ and $v$ with $d_G(u, w) = k$. We say that $G$ has bounded geodesic slices if $|S(u, v, k)|$ is uniformly bounded over all $u, v, k$. We call a graph $L$ geodesically directable if it has a bounded extension $G$ with bounded geodesic slices.
  Contrary to previous expectations, we prove that $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable. Physically, this provides a setting in which one could devise exactly-solvable chaotic local quantum circuits with non-trivial correlation patterns on 2D Euclidean lattices. In fact, we show that any bounded extension of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable. This further implies that all two-dimensional regular tilings are geodesically directable.

Abstract: Origins of life research investigates how life could emerge from prebiotic chemistry only. One possible explanation provides the RNA world hypothesis. It states that life could emerge from RNA strands only, storing and transferring biological information, as well as catalyzing reactions as ribozymes. Before this state could have emerged, however, the prebiotic world was probably a purely chemical pool of short RNA strands with random sequences and without biological function performing hybridization and dehybridization, as well as ligation and cleavage. In this context relevant questions are what are the conditions that allow longer RNA strands to be built and how can information carrying in RNA sequence emerge?
  In order to investigate such RNA reactors, efficient simulations are needed because the space of possible RNA sequences increases exponentially with the length of the strands, as well as the number of reactions between two strands. In addition, simulations have to be compared to experimental data for validation and parameter calibration. Here, we present the MoRSAIK python package for sequence motif (or k-mer) reactor simulation, analysis and inference. It enables users to simulate RNA sequence motif dynamics in the mean field approximation as well as to infer the reaction parameters from data with Bayesian methods and to analyze results by computing observables and plotting. MoRSAIK simulates an RNA reactor by following the reactions and the concentrations of all strands inside up to a certain length (of four nucleotides by default). Longer strands are followed indirectly, by tracking the concentrations of their containing sequence motifs of that maximum length.

Abstract: The capacity to resist pathogens is recognized as a fundamental property of the immune system, yet it remains a phenomenological concept and lacks a defined physical basis, leaving its fundamental entity, definition, and quantification unresolved. Here, we address these questions by introducing a theoretical framework based on Lagrangian analytical mechanics, which recasts immune recognition as a dynamical system in an immunological state space. Generalized coordinates are used to describe the conformational states of immune receptors, and their evolution is governed by Euler-Lagrange equations constructed from the antigen-receptor interaction. Central to our theory is the identification of a continuous symmetry: the action remains invariant under specific translations within the antigenic structure space. From this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates a conserved quantity, I. We identify this conserved quantity as the physical embodiment of host immunity, a measurable quantity that encapsulates the system's protective capacity, encompassing both its breadth and intensity. This prediction is testable through statistically indistinguishable responses to antigen pairs related by the symmetry transformation. Furthermore, This theoretical model provides a unified framework for understanding key immunological phenomena, including vaccination, immune memory, tolerance, original antigenic sin, and T cell exhaustion. The conserved quantity I comprises a component quantifying protective breadth (with the dimension of action) and a component governing response intensity (with the dimension of energy), is thus established as a fundamental physical entity. This work transforms immune capacity from a phenomenological concept into a quantifiable entity, thereby establishing a foundational framework for predictive immunology and immunological intervention.

Here we report a monolithic, inverse-designed potassium bromide (KBr) lens that achieves broadband, near-achromatic focusing from 0.45 to 14 $μ$m, a continuous spectral span covering the visible, near-, mid-, and long-wave infrared. This corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 1.9, approaching the theoretical limit of 2, while maintaining a nearly constant focal length across the entire range. The 19-mm-diameter, 22.5-mm-focal-length optic enables a single compact platform for hyperspectral imaging, mid-IR microscopy, super-resolution, imaging through scattering media, and simultaneous multi-band and long-range imaging. Coupling the KBr lens with a conventional refractive element further yields a hybrid telescope that extends these capabilities. By uniting inverse design with scalable manufacturing, this approach provides a route toward broadly deployable ultra-broadband imagers for biomedicine, climate and environmental monitoring, and space-based sensing.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a Mamyshev oscillator based on gain-managed nonlinearity and chirped pulse amplification. To the best of our knowledge, this configuration is first presented. Different from other Mamyshev oscillators, the gain-managed nonlinear regime serves as a seed provider instead of a power amplifier in one arm. The output pulse energy over 300nJ has been achieved from the chirped pulsed amplification in another arm. This configuration provided a new approach to design a high-energy ultrafast laser.

Abstract: We present an experimental method to determine the refractive index of $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ (x = 0.0 - 0.5) from 300 K to 4 K across the 500 - 1100 nm wavelength range. The values are extracted from spectroscopically observed microcavity resonances in thin $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ membranes embedded between fully and partially reflective gold mirrors. Refined Varshni and Paessler models are used to describe temperature-dependent bandgap shifts and material composition. By tracking resonance shifts and benchmarking against finite-difference time-domain simulations, we derive the dispersive optical response with high precision. This yields a quantitatively improved analytical expression for the refractive index of $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ matching the experimental results with a coefficient of determination as high as $R^2=0.993$, enabling accurate modeling near the band edge at cryogenic temperatures. The method is straightforward and broadly applicable to other semiconductor systems, offering a valuable tool for the design of micro photonic devices such as quantum light sources.

Abstract: Motivated by recent breakthrough studies of wave hyperbolicity in extremely anisotropic natural materials and artificial composites, we investigate the radiation pattern of a localized emitter in a hyperbolic medium. Since the emission of a point source is associated with the Fourier transform of the iso-frequency contours of a medium, we derive and analyze the properties of the Fourier transform of hyperbolic dispersion, which sheds light into the emission properties in the presence of hyperbolic bands. Our analysis leads to a generalized form of Huygens' principle for hyperbolic waves, connecting to the emergence of negative refraction and focusing with hyperbolic media. We also highlight the occurrence of aliasing artifacts in polariton imaging. More broadly, our findings provide analytical tools to model polariton propagation in materials with extreme anisotropy, and may be applied to several other physical platforms featuring hyperbolic responses, from astrophysics to seismology.

Conclusion: 该方法为光的极化提供了一个更全面和统一的描述框架，超越了传统电场描述的局限。

Abstract: Although electric and magnetic fields are intrinsically coupled in random stationary light, a complete and physically consistent second-order description of polarization requires a joint electromagnetic treatment. The 6x6 electromagnetic polarization matrix introduced here generalizes the conventional electric 3x3 matrix by incorporating both electric and magnetic contributions together with their mutual correlations. It consists of diagonal 3x3 blocks, representing the electric and magnetic polarization matrices, and off-diagonal 3x3 blocks that encode the full structure of electric-magnetic cross-correlations. The information contained in this matrix can be interpreted through physically meaningful quantities such as active and reactive energy fluxes, in-phase and quadrature alignment matrices, and global indices describing electric-magnetic coupling. The formalism is applied to a field composed of two orthogonally propagating plane waves sharing a common linear electric polarization (a simple yet physically realizable configuration) that demonstrates the need for a general combined electric-magnetic representation even in free space. This approach provides a comprehensive and unified framework for characterizing electromagnetic polarization beyond the electric-field description alone, bridging classical statistical optics with quantum-like density-matrix interpretations.

Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, defined by $ | Re(ε) | < 1$, enable unique light propagation characteristics, including confinement within sub-wavelength regions. To reduce losses in this regime, materials with both near-zero permittivity and $n<1$ refractive index, known as near-zero-index (NZI) materials, are desired. When both conditions are satisfied, the resulting region is classified as a low-loss ENZ medium combining strong light confinement with reduced optical losses. To achieve this behavior in the mid-IR, heavily doped semiconductors are required, and those compatible with current technologies are most desirable. This work provides the first in-depth study, supported by experimental demonstrations, of the plasmonic properties of highly doped GaN thin films on Si, exhibiting low optical losses and low-loss ENZ characteristics up to $3μm$. From the extracted optical parameters, the ENZ and NZI regions are determined and compared with the existing literature. As a result of the large polar character of nitrides, a hybridization of the surface plasmon and phonon polaritons is observed, accompanied by a flat-dispersion of the high-energy mode (pinned near the plasma frequency) indicative of its ENZ character. Establishing GaN as a viable platform for mid-IR ENZ-based plasmonics paves the way for integration into future infrared photonic technologies.

Abstract: Free-space and on-chip photonic systems are key components in optical communication networks. While free-space beams allow for the flexible generation and manipulation of spatial modes, integrated waveguides provide compact and stable platforms for on-chip signal processing. Bridging these two domains is essential for scalable multi-mode communication networks. Here, we present an efficient, broadband interface capable of converting multiple higher-order free-space Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes into corresponding waveguide modes using the multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) scheme. We experimentally demonstrate low-crosstalk mode conversion between various set of three LG modes, and the first three TE modes of a multimode silicon waveguide across the telecom C-band. The system operates passively without active switching and can be adapted to different spatial mode sets. This platform provides a pathway to increased data capacities and may enable more compact and efficient multi-mode optical communication and on-chip processing schemes.

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian photonics offer singular sensitivity enhancements but have thus far been realized almost exclusively in spatially engineered platforms with fixed geometries and limited tunability. Here we extend EP physics into the temporal domain by introducing balanced gain--loss modulation in a photonic time crystal (PTC). A time-periodic refractive-index modulation $n(t)=n_{0}+δn\cos(Ωt)$ generates an effective non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian that supports coalescence of quasi-eigenmodes in frequency space, constituting a genuine \textit{temporal exceptional point}. Using a reduced two-mode model for the dominant frequency sidebands, we derive a non-Hermitian dimer Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{PT}}(Δ,γ,κ)$ that is strictly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric for $Δ=0$ and identify the exact EP condition. Numerical analysis reveals the associated Riemann-sheet topology, mode exchange and Berry-phase accumulation upon encirclement of the EP, and the characteristic $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ perturbation response indicative of enhanced sensing. We further construct a non-Hermitian transmission model that is exact within the reduced two-mode description, compute the Cramér--Rao bound (CRB) for temperature estimation under an explicit noise model, and show that EP-enhanced sensitivity persists when compared to a linewidth-matched Hermitian reference under identical resource constraints. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the CRB is saturable using spectral measurements. These results establish temporal non-Hermiticity as a new paradigm for dynamically reconfigurable, broadband, and geometry-independent exceptional-point photonics.

Conclusion: Simple platform for low-power, scalable nonlinear optical circuits suitable for integrated photonics and neuromorphic devices.

Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are emerging as a key technology for compact and energy-efficient optical information processing. Yet, their practical implementation remains limited by the intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities of conventional materials, which demand high power and large footprints to achieve significant nonlinear responses. Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter excitations of semiconducting materials, offer a promising solution by combining strong optical nonlinearities with the high speed and large scalability typical of photonic devices. However, despite their potential, working on-chip polaritonic elements demonstrating room temperature coherent lasing, controllable nonlinear propagation, or amplification have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate a fully integrated perovskite polaritonic circuit that overcomes these limitations. Using a single-step microfluidic lithographic technique, we realize waveguide circuits with integrated gratings that simultaneously act as couplers and mirrors, forming in-plane Fabry-Pérot cavities. These structures support robust in-plane polariton lasing between gratings, yielding coherent emission along the waveguide. Furthermore, we observe clear signatures of strong nonlinear self-phase modulation and, for the first time, optical amplification of guided polaritons at room temperature. Our simple, scalable platform opens the way to low-power, highly nonlinear optical circuits for integrated photonics and neuromorphic architectures operating at room temperature.

Abstract: In Real-Time, Feedback-Driven Single Particle Tracking methods, measurements of the emission intensity from a labeled, nanometer-scale particle are used in a feedback loop to track the motion of the particle as it moves inside its native environment, including within living cells. In this work, we take advantage of Point Spread Function (PSF) engineering techniques that encode the axial position of the particle into the shape of the PSF in the focal plane to eliminate the need for out-of-focal-plane measurements, reducing the complexity of implementation and decreasing the overall measurement time of the control loop. Specifically, we used the Double Helix PSF (DH-PSF) in which a single fluorescent source gives rise to two lobes in the image plane with the lobes rotating in the plane as the particle moves along the optical axis. We designed simple estimators of the relative error between the particle and the tracker, and a simple proportional feedback controller to regulate that error to zero. We explored the efficacy of the approach through simulation studies, demonstrating the tracking of fast-moving particles (with diffusion coefficients up to 10 {μ\text{m}^2/\text{s}}) over long time periods (multiple seconds).

Abstract: Soliton optical frequency combs have become key enablers for a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, optical atomic clocks, ultrafast distance measurements, dual-comb spectroscopy, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration, many of which benefit from low repetition rates. However, achieving such low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs is nontrivial as long cavities require substantially higher pump power, which induces stronger thermal effects that, in turn, exacerbate thermal instability and complicate access to stable soliton states. The dual-mode pumping scheme, in which a continuous-wave pump couples to both the comb-generating mode and an auxiliary mode, has proven simple and effective for mitigating thermal instability and enabling thermally accessible soliton generation. Yet, in long-cavity devices, the standard bus-to-resonator coupling conditions for these two modes diverge substantially, resulting in insufficient pump coupling to the auxiliary mode, which makes dual-mode pumping particularly challenging for low-repetition-rate microcombs. In this work, we overcome this limitation by coupling the pump to the auxiliary mode via inter-modal coupling, which can be introduced in racetrack microresonators and engineered by tailoring the cavity bend design. We validate this approach in a high-Q (>$10^7$) silicon nitride microresonator and demonstrate thermally accessible, deterministic single-soliton generation at a repetition rate of 33 GHz. This work provides a simple and robust pathway for generating low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs.

Abstract: Flying focus laser pulse technology, characterized by programmable velocity profiles and the ability to break the traditional link between focal spot motion and group velocity constraints, holds significant potential for revolutionary advances in high-intensity laser related fields. However,the flying focus generated with conventional approaches suffers from a low maximum intensity, as the energy is spread over a long distance, and the size of the focusing optics is also limited. Here, we propose a zone-plate-based flying focus scheme in which the zone widths are modulated by a sinusoidal random distribution. Numerical simulations show that the high-order foci produced by the modulated zone plate can be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the scheme sustains a high-intensity focal region extending over more than 100 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, the focal speed can be tuned over a wide range, including values exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. Owing to these advantages, the proposed modulated zone-plate scheme offers new possibilities for high-intensity laser physics and holds promise for applications such as laser wakefield acceleration, photon acceleration, and more.

Abstract: Microcombs generated in optical microresonators are widely regarded as promising light sources for next-generation communication systems, but the optical power available per comb line has so far fallen short of practical requirements. Here we introduce an integrated Fabry-Pérot microresonator platform that overcomes fundamental dispersion-engineering constraints and enables bright soliton microcombs with unprecedented power per line. The resonator is defined by chirped Bragg gratings that provide exceptionally large anomalous group-velocity dispersion, allowing more than ten comb lines to reach the milliwatt level. These combs can be used directly in coherent communication systems without additional amplification, achieving an aggregate data rate of 2 Tb/s. Once integrated, our high-power soliton microcombs could be instantly ready for communications as well as a broad range of practical comb-based applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original paper aimed to overcome the challenges in terahertz (THz) source development by using spintronic emitters and plasmonic coupling for enhanced efficiency.

Method: A plastic drop-casting method was employed to deposit a sparse layer of silica-gold core-shell nanoparticles onto a W/Fe/Pt spintronic trilayer structure, which was subsequent tested to measure the THz pulse energy.

Result: The study successfully demonstrated that the sparse coating increases the wafer-averaged THz pulse energy, indicating enhanced local conversion efficiency in the spintronic emitter even at low material coverage.

Conclusion: This work provides a feasible method for designing highly efficient spintronic terahertz emitters with applications in spectroscopy, imaging, and ultrafast technologies.

Abstract: Spintronic emitters promise to revolutionise terahertz (THz) sources by converting ultrafast optical pulses into broadband THz radiation without phase-matching constraints. Because the conversion relies on spin-current injection across a nanometre-thin magnetic layer, its efficiency is ordinarily limited by weak optical coupling. Here, we present a demonstration of a drop-casting based approach to introduce ultrafast plasmonic-mediated coupling: a sparse-layer of silica-gold core-shell nanoparticles is deposited directly onto a W/Fe/Pt spintronic trilayer. This sparse (six percent) decoration increases the wafer-averaged THz pulse energy, pointing to a very high local conversion enhancement for this low-coverage spintronic emitter compared with the bare stack. This demonstration points to a viable pathway toward highly efficient spintronic terahertz emitters with potential applications in spectroscopy, imaging, and ultrafast technologies.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the performance of a Gaussian optical beam as it propagates through the turbulent underwater optical channel (UWOC) under the weak turbulence regime, where optical signal experiences significant fading and scattering, all of which can severely degrade communication quality. It is assumed that on-off keying (OOK) modulation with direct detection is utilized to establish a duplex communication link. A multi-wavelength beam approach is implemented to enhance the performance by leveraging the distinct propagation characteristics of different wavelengths. Performance is established in terms of the probability of fade, number of fade per second, mean fade duration, and mean time between fades. The use of multi-wavelength beam is shown to enhance performance by a sizable margin.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and analysis of reflective metalenses optimized for a 900 nm wavelength, using silicon nanorods as the primary components. The metalens consists of unit cells, each containing a thin silicon rod. Lumerical FDTD software is used to create a detailed library that connects the dimensions of these nanorods with their respective phase shifts and reflectance properties. The nanorods are placed on a 70 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer, with a 50 nm thick gold (Au) reflective layer underneath. In contrast to conventional transmissive metalenses, our design accomplishes complete 2π phase control via geometry-optimized silicon nanorods, facilitating compact reflective optics. By carefully examining the impact of nanorod dimensions on optical performance, the main goal is to optimize the metalens design for enhanced light focusing and manipulation, which could benefit imaging systems, optical communications, and sensor technology.

Experimental confirmation is provided in acoustics through full three-dimensional measurements of the velocity vector field. Although these phenomena are intrinsic to vortex cores, we also show that the claimed universality breaks down for higher-order topological charges, depending on the carrier mode, here exemplified using the Bessel framework.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for emerging quantum technologies, enabling secure communication and enhanced sensing. For decades, generating polarization entangled states has been mainly achieved using bulk crystals with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), preventing scalability and on-chip integration. Miniaturizing the quantum source provides access to more versatility and tunability while enabling an easier integration to other devices, notably necessary for satellite-based quantum communication, and eventually reducing fabrication costs. This challenging task can be achieved with Zinc Blende GaAs nanowires. They already have shown an efficient photon pairs generation via SPDC at 1550 nm. Here we demonstrate that a pair of orthogonal GaAs nanowires constitutes a new nanoscale platform to control the quantum state at telecommunication wavelength, enabling a transition from polarization entangled to separable states as a function of the pump polarization, with fidelities reaching 90%

Abstract: We investigate the spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field by combining large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with self-consistent spin-wave theory. The resulting field-coupling phase diagram reveals that quantum fluctuations stabilize coplanar order across the entire parameter range, giving rise to a characteristic sequence of magnetization plateaux. Near the quantum-spin-liquid window $0.06 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.14$, which extends to magnetic field $B \sim J_1$, we identify overlapping $m = 1/3$ and $m = 1/2$ plateaux - a distinctive hallmark of the system's proximity to the low-field spin-liquid regime. The excellent quantitative agreement between DMRG and self-consistent one-loop spin-wave calculations demonstrates that semiclassical approaches can reliably capture and parameterize the plateau phases of triangular quantum antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) exhibits hysteresis in resistance while undergoing a thermally driven insulator-metal transition (IMT). Understanding the nonequilibrium effects in resistance is of great interest, as VO$_2$ is a strong candidate for brain-inspired computing, which is more energy efficient for AI tasks compared to traditional computing. Accurate models of the connection between microscopic and macroscopic transport properties and microscopic imaging of VO$_2$ will allow us to better utilize VO$_2$ in future applications. However, predictions of macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ that quantitatively match observations using spatially resolved data have not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate an accurate prediction of the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ throughout the entire temperature range of interest, by developing a multiscale resistor network model incorporating the assumption of fractal sub-pixel structure of the optical data, where the configuration of insulating and metallic domains within each pixel are drawn from the random field Ising model near criticality. This strongly indicates that the observed fractal, power law structure of metallic and insulating domains extends down to much smaller length scales than the current record for experimental resolution of this system, and that the two-dimensional random field Ising model near criticality is a suitable model for describing the metal and insulator patches of VO$_2$ down to scales that approach the unit cell.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the low-temperature spin dynamics of the metallic kagome compound Sc₃Mn₃Al₇Si₅, revealing a quantum-disordered magnetic ground state stabilized by geometric frustration and itinerant electrons. Key findings include reduced magnetic entropy, negative magnetoresistance, and field-dependent transport consistent with spin fluctuations. NMR experiments show enhanced nuclear relaxation due to indirect electronic spin coupling, suggesting partially gapped spin excitations. Spin-lattice relaxation exhibits a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak, indicative of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Overall, the study identifies an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, positioning the material among rare metallic kagome systems near a quantum spin liquid state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study likely explores the interplay between geometric frustration and itinerant electrons in the kagome lattice material to understand the stabilization of a quantum-disordered magnetic state. The motivation is to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics and identify the conditions for a quantum spin liquid.

Method: The research combines bulk thermodynamic probes like temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat, low-noise FIB-device transport for electrical conductivity and magnetoresistance, along with comprehensive ⁵⁵Mn NMR for probing local spin dynamics. Advanced techniques like magnetoresistance and NMR provide complementary insights into the material's electronic and magnetic properties.

Result: The findings indicate that Sc₃Mn₃Al₇Si₅ hosts an unconventional quantum-disordered magnetic state with frustrated, gapped spin dynamics. This is supported by bulk data showing reduced magnetic entropy, negative magnetoresistance, and field-dependent transport consistent with spin scattering. NMR results highlight enhanced relaxation rates due to indirect indirect electronic spin coupling, pointing to partially gapped spin excitations. Additionally, spin-lattice relaxation shows a coherence peak, suggesting the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations, and the material is positioned among rare metallic kagome systems near a quantum spin liquid state.

Conclusion: The study conclusively demonstrates that Sc₃Mn₃Al₇Si₅ exhibits an unconventional correlated quantum-disordered magnetic state, primarily characterized by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics. This state is of significant interest as it places the material among a few metallic kagome systems that may host a quantum spin liquid, providing valuable insights into the interplay between geometric frustration and itinerant electron correlations in stabilizing exotic magnetic states.

Abstract: The metallic kagome compound Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ has attracted attention as a candidate platform where geometric frustration and itinerant electrons may cooperate to stabilize a quantum-disordered magnetic ground state. Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.

Conclusion: 价电子裂解引起的相互作用对超导机理具有重要作用，推动了 cuprates 类材料的超导研究。

Abstract: We present a novel pairing mechanism for superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems, which often have both localised and itinerant charge carriers. An effective anisotropic interaction between the itinerant particles originates from the fluctuations in the crystal field associated with virtual hopping of the localised particles, a process that is also responsible for the Kondo exchange. Interestingly, this interaction is \emph{attractive} for charge transfer insulators such as cuprates. Considering a simple toy model for cuprates, without the antiferromagnetic exchange, this interaction leads to the correct d-wave superconducting gap, thus demonstrating its relevance.

Conclusion: sc-RPA在低温有效，高温无序基态适用；sc-RPA框架扩展性强；投影截断近似在RPAs中的适用需谨慎考虑。

Abstract: We derive the self-consistent random phase approximations (sc-RPA) from the projective truncation approximation (PTA) for the equation of motion of two-time Green's function. The obtained sc-RPA applies to arbitrary temperature and recovers the Rowe's formalism at zero temperature. The PTA formalism not only rationalize Rowe's formula, but also provides a general framework to extend sc-RPA. We implement the sc-RPA calculation for the one-dimensional spinless fermion model in the parameter regime of disordered ground state, with the N-representability constraints enforced. The obtained ground state energy, correlation function, and density spectral function agree well with existing results. The features of the Luttinger liquid ground state and the continuum/bound state in the spectral function are well captured. We discuss several issues concerning the approximations made in RPAs, difficulties of RPA for symmetric state, and the static component problem of PTA.

Abstract: Excitons and their complexes govern optical-related behaviors in semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have elucidated the light-matter interaction mediated by quasi-steady excitonic complexes within a monolayer of the prototypical two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor WSe2. Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of electronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state.

Abstract: Perovskite ruthenates are fascinating playgrounds for exploring topological spin textures, but generally rely on extrinsic mechanisms to trigger the noncoplanar states. Here we report the discovery of an emergent chiral spin crystal phase in (111) SrRuO3 epitaxial films, characterized by a significant topological Hall effect and noncoplanar spin arrangements with different propagation vectors along two orthogonal directions. Instead of driven by the enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion symmetry at heterointerfaces, this emergent state arises intrinsically from the interplay of dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, leading to the stabilization of topological phases in much thicker films. These findings open a new pathway for creating and controlling the topological spin states in perovskites, with broad implications for spintronic device design.

Abstract: Quantized Thouless pumps in periodic systems, set by Chern numbers or Wannier-center winding, is by now fairly well established, whereas its quasi-periodic extensions still require further clarification. Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moiré-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory.

Abstract: We use ultrafast optical spectroscopy to investigate the electronic and lattice dynamics of the charge-density wave (CDW) material 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ across various temperatures and pump fluences. We reveal a close relationship between the observed ultrafast dynamical processes and two characteristic temperatures: $T_{\rm CDW}$ ($\sim$202 K) and $T^*$ ($\sim$165 K). Two coherent phonon modes are identified: a high-frequency $A_{1g}$ mode ($ω_{1}$) and a lower-frequency $A_{1g}$ CDW amplitude mode ($ω_{2}$). In stark contrast to thermal melting, where phonons soften, the CDW amplitude mode exhibits anomalous hardening (frequency upshift) with increasing pump fluence. We establish this hardening as the direct signature of an ultrafast restoration of the bare lattice potential. The photoexcited carrier plasma screens the long-range electron-phonon interactions that drive the Peierls-like instability, effectively ``undressing" the soft phonon and driving its frequency toward the stiffer value of the unrenormalized lattice. Furthermore, an abrupt increase in the excited state buildup time above a critical pump fluence marks a sharp boundary to a photoinduced metastable metallic state. These findings demonstrate that the CDW order in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ is governed by a fragile, fluence-tunable competition between excitonic correlations and lattice dynamics.

Conclusion: 尽管两电子系统在对称位势中分裂较小，但可以准确描述较大部分实际体系。

Abstract: We study the exchange coupling in small Wigner crystals confined to one-dimensional space. In particular we concentrate on the simplest nontrivial case of two electrons in a box potential and calculate analytically the energy splitting between the lowest spatially symmetric and antisymmetric states, which is a relevant energy scale for the magnetic properties of the system. In the approximation of a fixed center of mass coordinate, the splitting decays exponentially with the square root of the distance between the electrons at the leading order. We show that the subleading exponential correction significantly increases the splitting and thus becomes crucial in order to describe correctly the exact numerical data for system sizes that are not astronomically large. Two methods of calculation of the energy splitting are developed. The first is based on the analysis of the exact solution that can be expressed in terms of the Whittaker functions. It applies at all values of the short-distance cutoff played by the width of one-dimensional wire that regularizes the Coulomb potential. The second method is based on the quasiclassical (or Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, which applies only for sufficiently large values of the cutoff. The two methods give identical result in the overlapping region. As a side result, our study gives the energy splitting in a triangular double well potential of inverse ``M'' shape.

Motivation: The paper suggests new applications in sensor technology by manipulating electron relaxation in specific directions, potentially enhancing sensitivity and speed.

Method: Theoretical analysis and modeling of electron-phonon interactions under non-equilibrium conditions, supported by pump-probe spectroscopy experiments.

Result: Demonstration of transient heating and Seebeck-like effects, enabling potential all-optical sensing mechanisms.

Conclusion: The findings could significantly advance ultrafast sensor applications by leveraging tilted Dirac cone materials' unique properties for induced thermal and electric responses.

Abstract: We point out that in the tilted Dirac cone materials the non-equilibrium (hot) electron relaxation with phonons is anisotropic in the Brillouin zone. It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects. This is equivalent to inducing a transient Seebeck effect by just shinning light on a tilted Dirac cone material!

Abstract: Lattice degrees of freedom (DoF) play a central role in correlated electron systems, strongly influencing the dynamics of the underlying charge carriers and spin excitations. In nickelates, understanding the role of lattice is essential to unravel the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degree of freedom in giving rise to various emergent phenomena reported recently. Here, we investigate the phononic DoF in a series of trilayer nickelates, namely Pr4-xLaxNi3O10 (where x = 0, 0.4, 1, 2, 3.6, and 4) using temperature and polarization dependent Raman scattering measurements. Our in-depth analysis of the phonon evolution with temperature and doping, gives interesting insights into the behaviour of these materials. All these systems undergo a metal-to-metal transition (TMMT), characterized by the development of intertwined spin and charge density waves, with the spin density wave preceding the charge density wave. These transitions manifest as pronounced anomalies in phonon self-energy parameters i.e. peak frequency and linewidth in the vicinity of the metal-to-metal transition. Several phonon modes show dramatic change (nearly an order of magnitude for some modes) in their softening rates across the TMMT, highlighting the sensitivity of the lattice dynamics to spin and charge order. These findings emphasize the crucial role of lattice DoF in mediating correlated ground states in layered nickelates.

Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo and numerical analytic continuation methods, we study the dynamic spin structure factor and the single-hole spectral function of a two-dimensional quantum magnet ($J$-$Q$ model) at its quantum phase transition separating Néel antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. At this putative deconfined quantum-critical point, we find a broad continuum of spinon excitations that can be accounted for by the fermionic $π$-flux state; a known mean-field model for deconfined quantum criticality. We find that the best description of the two-spinon continuum is with a version of the model with a $2\times 2$ unit cell, reflecting non-trivial mutual statistics of spinons and anti-spinons. The single-hole spectral function can be described by the same spinon dispersion relation and an independently propagating holon. Thus, the system exhibits spin-charge separation and will likely evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping.

*Seokjin Bae,Arjun Raghavan,Irena Feldman,Amit Kanigel,Vidya Madhavan*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents evidence that Ta2NiSe5 is an excitonic insulator (EI), a charge-neutral material with electron-hole pairs that shows dissipationless charge transport and potential optoelectronic applications. The EI phase transition is associated with structural distortion, but the insulating gap persists in regions where structural distortion is absent, suggesting that charge correlations are key to the EI state. The insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles, and the decay length of in-gap states matches estimates of the exciton wavefunction size. These findings confirm that Ta2NiSe5 is a versatile material for studying bosonic condensates, offering insights into intrinsic EIs under ambient conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of excitonic insulators is motivated by their potential for dissipationless charge transport, optoelectronic applications, and understanding exotic quantum phenomena like the EI phase transition. Searching for intrinsic EIs at ambient pressure is challenging and has led to significant research interest in materials like Ta2NiSe5.

Method: The researchers used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to investigate the electronic and structural properties of Ta2NiSe5. They focused on measuring the insulating gap, analyzing charge puddles, and assessing the decay length of in-gap states to determine if the material supports an excitonic origin for the insulating state.

Result: The results confirm that Ta2NiSe5 is an excitonic insulator. The insulating gap persists in regions without structural distortion, which rules out structural distortion as the primary cause of the EI ground state. Additionally, the suppression of the gap at localized charge puddles indicates that charge correlations are important in producing the insulating gap. The decay length of in-gap states correlates with previous photoemission studies, supporting the idea that the exciton wavefunction size is a key factor in the EI state.

Conclusion: This paper is a significant contribution to the understanding of excitonic insulators. By providing strong evidence that Ta2NiSe5 is an EI and that charge correlations and excitonic condensation are key aspects, it opens up new avenues for research into these materials and their potential applications in optoelectronics and other fields.

Abstract: An excitonic insulator (EI) is a charge-neutral bosonic condensate of spontaneously formed electron-hole pairs. Exotic quantum phenomena such as dissipationless charge neutral transport and huge potential for optoelectronic applications have led to an extensive search for intrinsic bulk materials that are EIs at ambient pressure without sophisticated device fabrication. The narrow gap semimetal Ta2NiSe5 has been proposed as a rare example of an intrinsic EI, but its ground state has remained controversial since the EI phase transition is accompanied by a structural distortion. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to present microscopic evidence that supports an excitonic origin of the insulating phase in Ta2NiSe5. First, we find that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent suggesting that the structural distortion is not the primary origin of insulating ground state. Second, the insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles which indicates that charge correlations are important in producing the insulating gap. Finally, the decay length of the in-gap states at the puddles shows similar value to the estimated size of the exciton wavefunction from previous photoemission studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ta2NiSe5 is an EI and may be a versatile platform to study the physics of bosonic condensates in solid-state system at ambient conditions.

TL;DR: 研究非绝romatic化学过程如光催化和光合作用必须用非绝romatic分子动力学（NAMD），需要精确的基态和激发态势能曲面（PESs）。量子计算可能解决经典方法不能计算的问题，但要成功应用量子算法是个挑战。本文提出了一种量子适配的LZSH方法，通过曲率驱动的跃迁修正，保护群体演化，保持效率的同时避免计算非绝射的交叠（NACs），并保持轨迹独立性以实现并行。此外，一个高精度PES计算协议得到发展，支持主动空间选择，可以在量子或经典集群上并行加速，并适应各种化学系统，如带电的H3+离子和C2H4分子。该工作为量子计算在NAMD中的实际应用奠定了基础，展示了量子-经典异构集群上并行仿真在计算化学中的潜力。

Abstract: In the study of non-adiabatic chemical processes such as photocatalysis and photosynthesis, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is an indispensable theoretical tool, which requires precise potential energy surfaces (PESs) of ground and excited states. Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry.

Result: 快切换下扩散系数与平均摩擦无关，表现出均匀的布朗运动；慢切换下出现间歇性运动和增强的扩散系数。动态不均匀性增强与扩散系数与平均摩擦的分离一致。

Conclusion: 这个简化的模型为理解液态、glass态和相分离软材料中的单粒子传输提供了清晰的框架。

Abstract: We investigate single-particle diffusion in a two-state Langevin model where the friction coefficient randomly switches between low-friction (liquid-like) and high-friction (glassy-like) states. The dynamics are governed by the ratio between the friction switching time $τ$ and the intrinsic velocity relaxation time $τ_0$. For fast switching ($τ/τ_0 \lesssim 1$) the motion is homogeneous and Brownian, whereas for slow switching ($τ/τ_0 \gg 1$) the particle exhibits intermittent dynamics and an enhanced diffusion coefficient. Analysis of the single-particle overlap function $Q(t)$ and the dynamic susceptibility $χ_4(t)$ reveals decoupling of the diffusion coefficient from the average friction upon cooling, which coincides with increasing temporal dynamic heterogeneity. This minimal model provides a transparent framework for understanding single-particle transport in media with fluctuating local mobility, including supercooled liquids and phase-separated soft materials.

Abstract: During testing of the Stress Managed Cosine-Theta dipole mirror magnet SMCTM1, magnet quenches were observed following large voltage spikes in the half-coil voltage taps which preceded normal quench initiation. Following some recent work at CERN measuring power current converter transients in relation to flux jumps, an additional differential current probe was added to the magnet instrumentation. Measurements of this probe, as well as the half coil voltage taps show a fast and substantial current change preceding the quench, hinting at coil motion. A simple model based on relative shift of the inner and outer layer coils was developed which suggests the magnitude of coil shift events is on the estimated relative coil shift from the magnet constraint conditions. The behavior is shown to be reversible and characteristic of stick-slip.

Abstract: The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) at Fermilab provides a versatile platform for studying the interplay of space-charge, impedance, and non-linear optics in high-intensity hadron beams within synchrotrons and storage rings. This report examines the parameters and dynamics of 2.5~MeV proton beam operations in two configurations of the bare IOTA lattice: one for demonstrating Non-linear Integrable Optics with the Danilov-Nagaitsev magnet, and the other for use with electron cooling. We offer order-of-magnitude estimates of the transverse emittance growth rate as a function of beam intensity, highlighting contributions from residual gas scattering, intra-beam scattering, and space-charge effects. Under nominal conditions, the beam lifetime is projected to be less than 7~minutes at low intensity with the current vacuum quality, and fewer than 100,000~turns at high intensity due to strong space-charge effects. The calculations presented here will guide strategies to mitigate emittance growth and inform future IOTA experiments.

Abstract: Auto-differentiation is a powerful tool for computing derivatives of simulation results with respect to given parameters. In this letter, we have applied this tool to investigate the instability of a dynamics system that is governed by 21 ordinary differential equations. This second-order instability (named envelope instability) is driven by space-charge effects and has significant impact on the operational regimes of particle accelerators. Our study delves into the three-dimensional envelope instability, incorporating both transverse and longitudinal coupling. Conventionally, analyzing this complex system would necessitate solving 441 ordinary differential equations, which is computationally intractable. However, by employing auto-differentiation, we were able to track only 21 equations. This approach allowed us to uncover an additional instability stopband, which arises from space-charge-induced coupling and has not been reported in previous studies. This research highlights the significant advantages of auto-differentiation in analyzing complicated dynamical systems involving a large number of ordinary differential equations.

Abstract: The longitudinal compression of high-intensity, space-charge-dominated proton bunches is a critical requirement for future proton-driven muon colliders. We propose a proton bunch compression experiment at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring at Fermilab to investigate optimal radio-frequency (RF) cavity parameters and lattice configurations. IOTA is a compact, fixed-energy storage ring dedicated to beam physics Research and Development and capable of circulating a 2.5 MeV proton beam under extreme space-charge conditions. Using the ImpactX code with its 3D space-charge solver, simulations indicate that the bunch length can be rapidly reduced by at least a factor of two without appreciable degradation of transverse beam quality--even in the strong space-charge regime. However, longitudinal defocusing due to the space-charge remains a significant challenge in short-pulsed intense proton bunches, and the optimization of compression under these conditions is discussed.

Abstract: We propose an exceptional-point (EP) framework for black-hole ringdown beyond the standard quasinormal-mode (QNM) paradigm. It provides a first-principles characterization of the resonance associated with avoided crossings near EPs, an effect that conventional QNM analysis cannot fully capture. Employing a phenomenological environmental black-hole model with the hyperboloidal framework, we identify near-coalescence of both QNM eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, and directly demonstrate that the resonance produces enhanced mode contributions in the time domain, resulting in characteristic departures from exponentially damped oscillations. Our formulation further reveals that the EP frequency, given by the averaged value of the resonant modes, emerges as the physically relevant observable in the near-EP regime, and offers a robust foundation for modeling and extracting resonant ringdown signals.

Abstract: We address a long-standing misperception on the gravitational ``arrow of time'', a proposal by Penrose (also known as the ``Weyl-curvature hypothesis") that associates structure formation along timelike directions in which Weyl-curvature scalars become dominant over Ricci scalars. A counterexample of this hypothesis was found by Bonnor on a class of exact solutions describing heat conducting spheres collapsing in a Vaidya background. We show that this result does not hold in the same class of solutions considered as physically viable near FLRW cosmological models, with the heat conduction vector interpreted as a peculiar velocity field. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the gravitational ``arrow of time'' and the gravitational entropy formalism of Clifton, Ellis and Tavakol.

Abstract: In this work I use a frequency-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli approach to compute the gravitational wave energy radiated by a compact body moving along a hyperbolic or parabolic geodesic of a Schwarzschild black hole. I compare my results with the latest post-Minkowskian (PM) calculations for the radiated energy and find agreement for hyperbolic orbits with large impact parameters and characterized by a velocity at infinity, $v_\infty$, as large as $v_\infty/c=0.7$. I also find agreement between my results and the leading-order PM expansion for the radiation absorbed by the black hole. I make further comparisons with post-Newtonian (PN) theory and show the effectiveness of a simple PN-PM hybrid model. Finally, I make a first comparison of the radiated energy between self-force and numerical relativity.

Abstract: The leading corrections to General Relativity can be parametrized by higher-derivative interactions in a low-energy effective field theory, in a way that is general and agnostic to the precise UV completion of gravity. Using pseudospectral methods, we compute the leading-order corrections to the Kerr metric across the entire range of sub-extremal values of spin and analyse their impact on physical quantities. We find that near-extremal black holes are most affected by the higher-derivative corrections, making them especially sensitive probes of new physics. A dataset of solutions and the code used to produce them are publicly available.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a new relativistic model for a charged anisotropic compact star in the framework of modified symmetric teleparallel gravity, namely $f(Q)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. By employing the MIT bag model equation of state, we establish a relation between the metric potentials, leading to an exact solution of the field equations for an anisotropic fluid configuration coupled with a non-linear electromagnetic source. The interior spacetime is smoothly matched with the exterior geometry calculated from the theoretical setup of $f(Q)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity using the Darmois-Israel junction conditions, ensuring the continuity of the metric functions and their derivatives at the stellar boundary. The physical viability of the model is examined through regularity, energy, and causality conditions, all of which are satisfied throughout the stellar interior. The study highlights how the pressure anisotropy, the propagation speeds of sound, and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff balance condition are interconnected, showing that the star remains in mechanical equilibrium only when the gravitational, hydrostatic, electric, and anisotropic contributions counterbalance one another appropriately. The dynamical stability of the configuration is further supported by the requirement $Γ> \tfrac{4}{3}$ for the adiabatic index, indicating resilience against small radial perturbations. The plots of compactness, surface redshift, and the mass--radius profiles confirm that all physical quantities behave regularly and vary smoothly throughout the stellar interior. We graphically plotted the mass-radius curves.

Abstract: We compute the tidal Love numbers for a particular axially symmetric configuration of extremal Reissner-Nordstrom geometry. By exactly solving the non-linear Einstein equations, we investigate the tidal response of extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in four-dimensional spacetimes under external gravitational fields. We show that, for the specific geometry considered, the static tidal Love number remains finite and non-vanishing to all orders in the external tidal field. By contrast, we verify that the Love number of an isolated extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole remains zero, in agreement with previous expectations. Furthermore, we explicitly calculate the Zerilli-Moncrief master functions and match them with the effective field theory description.

Abstract: We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti--de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Plebański type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.

Abstract: We develop a fully gauge-invariant and rigorously derived framework for computing the cumulative decoherence of gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through a stochastic quantum spacetime. Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence.

Abstract: The Gibbons-Werner (GW) method provides a geometric framework for calculating the deflection angle of particles in curved spacetimes, and numerous extensions based on the original version have been developed in recent years to expand its applicability. Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024)013], (a) We obtain a formula for the deflection angle of bound massive particles in SAS spacetimes by dividing bound orbits that azimuthally overlap with themselves into multiple non-overlapping segments. This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles.

Abstract: In the framework of $F(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}})$ Einstein-Cartan gravity with an action depending both of the Ricci scalar and the so-called Holst-invariant curvature we consider models that include cubic terms of the latter in the action and study their inflationary behavior. These terms can have a considerable effect either positive or negative in relation to the agreement with present observational data, depending on parameters. In parameter regions where the quadratic models fail to produce results consistent with observational data, the presence of these additional cubic terms can lead to compatible predictions.

Method: Mathematical modeling using GCJG and pressureless dark matter with energy exchange Q ∝ ρx; conservation equations solved analytically.

Result: Dark energy maintains positive temperature, avoiding thermodynamic violation; dark matter remains stable; dark energy transitions to phantom regime in the past; entropy production aligns with second law; dark energy undergoes late-time phase transition into phantom domain.

Conclusion: The model provides a thermodynamically consistent explanation for the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, with implications for the universe's past and present phases.

Abstract: This work investigates a cosmological model featuring an interaction between dark energy and dark matter, where the dark energy component is described by the Generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi gas (GCJG). In this study, we establish a system in which the GCJG and a pressureless dark matter fluid exchange energy via a linear interaction term, $Q \propto ρ_x$, being $ρ_{x}$ the dark energy density. By solving the conservation equations, we derive analytical expressions for the evolution of the dark energy and dark matter densities. The thermodynamic properties of this interacting system are then thoroughly analyzed. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that both dark components maintain positive temperatures, ensuring stability. Notably, the dark energy component transitions to a phantom regime in the past, a feature of interest for recent cosmological observations, without violating thermodynamic principles. The total entropy production is shown to be in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, an analysis of the specific heats suggests that while the dark matter sector remains thermodynamically stable, the dark energy sector undergoes a late-time phase transition, consistent with its entering into the phantom domain at effective level.

### [144] [Gravitational-wave imprints of Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson black holes: frequency blue-shift and waveform dephasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02921)

than a Kerr- Melvin background.

Motivation: Understanding EMRI's gravitational-wave emission across different spacetimes to improve parameter estimation for future detectors like LISA.

Method: Analyzed EMRI dynamics and gravitational waves using the Kerr- BR solution and compared with the widely used.
 Kerr-Melvin metric.

Result: An external magnetic field elevates the ISCO radius, increases its orbital frequency, and introduces a 'blu
shift' in the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency. Retrograde orbits are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, and their spin-frequ
 cy relationship inverts at ISCO. Magnetic field imprints are detectable in EMRI signals for LISA and similar detectors.

Conclusion: A comprehensive understanding of EMRI behavior in diverse spacetime geometries
elements essential for precise parameter estimation, particularly concerning black hole spin. Ignoring magnetic effects can
 lead to substantial biases in waveform models, affecting future detections and analyses.

Abstract: We investigate the orbital dynamics and gravitational-wave signatures of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, described by the exact Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (Kerr--BR) solution~\cite{Podolsky:2025tle}. In contrast to the widely used Kerr--Melvin metric, the Kerr--BR spacetime is of algebraic type~D, admits a clear asymptotic structure, and allows for a systematic analytic treatment of geodesics. By analyzing the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we find that the external magnetic field consistently pushes the ISCO to larger radii \(r_{\rm ISCO}\) for all spin configurations considered. Counterintuitively, despite this outward radial shift, the ISCO orbital frequency \(Ω_{\rm ISCO}\) increases monotonically with the magnetic-field strength, leading to a robust ``blue-shift'' of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency. We further show that retrograde orbits are significantly more sensitive to magnetic fields than prograde orbits, and identify a frequency crossover phenomenon in which magnetic corrections can invert the usual spin--frequency hierarchy at the ISCO. Finally, employing a semi-analytic adiabatic evolution scheme driven by exact geodesic relations and a leading-order quadrupole flux, we generate inspiral waveforms and quantify the substantial dephasing induced by the magnetic field. Our results indicate that large-scale magnetic environments can leave observable imprints in EMRI signals for future space-based detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, and that neglecting such effects in waveform models may introduce non-negligible biases in parameter estimation, particularly for the black-hole spin.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing in the wave-optics regime imprints characteristic frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations on gravitational-wave (GW) signals, yet to be detected by ground-based interferometers. Similar modulations may also arise from orbital eccentricity, raising the possibility of degeneracies that could lead to false microlensing claims. We investigate the extent to which eccentric binary black hole (BBH) signals can mimic microlensing signatures produced by an isolated point-mass lens. With a simulated population of eccentric signals using numerical relativity simulations and \texttt{TEOBResumS-Dalí} waveform model, we perform a Bayesian model-comparison study, supported by a complementary \textit{mismatch} analysis. We find a strong degeneracy for high eccentricities, low total masses, and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): under these conditions, quasicircular microlensed model can be strongly favored over quasicircular unlensed model, even when the true signal is unlensed. For moderate SNRs ($\sim 30$), binaries with $M_\mathrm{tot}\lesssim 100\,M_\odot$ and eccentricity $e \gtrsim 0.4$ are particularly susceptible to misclassifications. In such cases, inferred microlens parameters exhibit well-constrained posteriors despite being unphysical. Crucially, the degeneracy is completely removed when the recovery uses waveform models that incorporate eccentricity, which overwhelmingly favors the eccentric hypothesis over microlensing. Our results demonstrate that any event exhibiting strong Bayesian evidence for microlensing should also be analyzed with eccentric waveform models and vice-versa to avoid false positives and biased astrophysical inference. This work contributes to developing robust strategies for interpreting signals in the era of precision GW astronomy.

Motivation: Gravitational-wave data analysis faces challenges with increasing observation rates and complexity, necessitating flexible and scalable methods.

Method: We developed a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a specialized training strategy to enable adaptation to diverse analysis settings.

Result: The model successfully analyzes 48 gravitational-wave events across various configurations, improves median sample efficiency, and provides insights into how detector and frequency settings affect posterior distributions and tests of general relativity.

Conclusion: Dingo-T1 represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis, offering a robust framework for handling missing or incomplete data and supporting future observatories with its scalability and adaptability.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave data analysis relies on accurate and efficient methods to extract physical information from noisy detector signals, yet the increasing rate and complexity of observations represent a growing challenge. Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.

Abstract: The existence of a fundamental zero-point length, $l_0$, a minimal spacetime scale predicted by T-duality in string theory or quantum gravity theories, modifies the entropy associated with the horizon of spacetime. In the cosmological setup, this leads to correction to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the Universe. In this paper, we investigate the implications of zero-point length $l_0$-corrected gravity for gravitational baryogenesis and early universe thermodynamics, deriving constraints on $l_0$ from observational baryon asymmetry data. We observe that under the condition of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, $l_0$ generates $\dot{\mathcal{R}}\neq 0$ during radiation epoch, where $\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar. This yields a baryon asymmetry parameter $η\propto l_0^2 T_D^9/M_{\rm Pl}^7$. The observed baryon asymmetry $η\sim 9.9 \times 10^{-11}$ constrains $l_0 \lesssim 7.1 \times 10^{-33} m$, approximately $440$ times the Planck length. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the zero-point length correction in the Friedmann equation, effectively slows the expansion rate at high energies, resulting in a modified time-temperature relationship where the Universe maintains higher temperatures for longer time during early epochs compared to standard cosmology. Our results establish zero-point length cosmology as a testable framework connecting quantum gravity to cosmological observables, with implications for early universe thermal history and fundamental length scales.

Conclusion: 内部拓扑壳的存在展示了其潜在的可探测性，为理解 neutron 星提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study the structural and dynamical consequences of introducing a distributional density profile inside a neutron star, representing a massless, topological shell located at an arbitrary radius. We incorporate this effect into the structure of neutron star and construct equilibrium sequence for several realistic equations of state. Radial stability is examined through the Sturm-Liouville formulation of the $\ell=0$ perturbation equation, supplemented with a jump condition and imprinting distinct features on the fundamental $f$-mode spectrum. We find strong, non-monotonic variations in the mode frequency relative to standard no-shell models. Using first-principles scaling relations, we estimate various gravitational wave observables such as the damping time, quality factor, luminosity and characteristic strain. These observables are then compared with the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Our results demonstrate that internal topological shells can leave potentially observable signatures in the oscillation and gravitational wave properties of neutron stars.

Abstract: We investigate the challenges of constructing neutron star (NS) solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, highlighting the importance of treating the affine connection as an active, dynamical component of the theory. We begin by clarifying under what conditions standard simplifications -- such as the coincident gauge or General Relativity (GR)-like connections -- inadvertently lead to GR behavior, even in non-trivial $f(\mathbb{Q})$ models. Building on previous work in black hole (BH) spacetimes, we adapt the formalism to NS and extend it to non-vacuum configurations. Focusing on two representative models, $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + α\mathbb{Q}^2$ and $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q}^β$, our analysis suggests that, under standard regularity assumptions, solutions with Maclaurin/Laurent-type series recover GR dynamics, pointing to more intricate structures as the likely seat of beyond-GR effects, and reflecting the constraints imposed by the connection's dynamics on the asymptotic behavior of genuinely beyond-GR solutions. We then formulate the problem as a boundary value problem (BVP) and highlight the numerical pathologies that may arise, together with possible strategies to prevent them. This work aims to provide a concrete framework for future numerical studies and outlines the theoretical consistency conditions required to construct physically meaningful beyond-GR NS solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity.

Abstract: Cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors offer excellent room-temperature energy resolution, making them well suited for X- and $γ$-ray spectroscopy in challenging environments. Within the SIDDHARTA-2 program at the DA$Φ$NE collider, a new CZT-based detection system has been developed to enable precision measurements of kaonic atom transitions in the intermediate mass range. In this work, we report the results of a calibration campaign performed with the collider operating, aimed at assessing the detector performance. A dedicated setup, including an array of quasi-hemispherical CZT sensors and a $^{152}$Eu source, was used to characterize the spectral response. The reconstructed emission lines were fitted with a model accounting for Gaussian response and incomplete charge recollection tails, and the detector linearity was evaluated by comparing the measured peak positions with their nominal energies. The results demonstrate that the CZT detector exhibits excellent linearity and stable operation with the collider on, confirming its suitability for future kaonic-atom spectroscopy at DA$Φ$NE.

Abstract: Kaonic atoms, formed when a negatively charged kaon replaces an electron, provide a sensitive probe of the low-energy strong interaction via precision X-ray spectroscopy. The SIDDHARTA-2 experiment at the DA$Φ$NE collider employs high-performance Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) optimized for the 4-12 keV range to study light kaonic systems. In preparation for the EXKALIBUR phase, which targets heavier kaonic atoms, new 1 mm-thick SDDs have been developed with Politecnico di Milano and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. Their increased thickness enhances the quantum efficiency by a factor of about two at 30 keV while preserving excellent energy resolution. These detectors are also intended for VIP-3, the next-generation test of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP). Building on VIP-2, which set the most stringent limits on PEP-violating $K_α$ transitions in copper, VIP-3 will extend the search to heavier elements such as Ag, Sn, and Zr. Preliminary measurements demonstrate efficient detection up to 30 keV, supporting future high-precision studies of the kaon-nucleon interaction and PEP in heavier systems.

TL;DR: Single-photon sensitive detectors like Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are widely used in medical imaging. This paper presents a new method using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for light position reconstruction in a 2x2 array of linearly-graded SiPMs, which enhances resolution and allows for a higher number of resolved areas by at least 5.7 times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging applications often require high precision and resolution. The use of SiPMs and their ability to detect single photons make them suitable for such applications. However, existing reconstruction techniques may not fully utilize the capabilities of these detectors, leading to potential improvements in position resolution and the number of resolved areas.

Method: The authors propose using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for light position reconstruction in a 2x2 array of linearly-graded Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The DNN is trained to minimize distortions in the reconstructed event maps, thereby improving the resolution and linearity of position detection.

Result: The DNN-based reconstruction method significantly enhances the resolution and linearity of position detection compared to traditional reconstruction formulas. Specifically, the method increases the number of resolved areas (pixels) by a factor of at least 5.7, enabling higher precision and performance in light detection.

Conclusion: The use of DNNs for light position reconstruction in SiPM arrays represents a promising advancement in medical imaging technology. This approach not only improves the resolution and linearity of position detection but also opens new possibilities for more precise and high-performance imaging systems.

Abstract: Single-photon sensitive detectors like Silicon Photomultipliers are widely used in many medical imaging applications. By using detectors with position resolutions, it is possible to build compact photodetector readouts with reduced number of channels, but still preserving position resolution and gamma-rays imaging capabilities. In this work, we present the advantage of using a Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) light position reconstruction applied to a 2x2 array of linearly-graded SiPMs (LG-SiPMs), to minimize the distortions on the reconstructed event maps. Our approach significantly enhances both the resolution and linearity of position detection compared to the nominal reconstruction formula based on the device architecture. Remarkably, the DNN-based reconstruction boosts the number of resolved areas (pixels) by a factor of at least 5.7, allowing a higher level of precision and performance in light detection.

Abstract: We broach a seldom-discussed topic in precision metrology; how subtle errors in calibration processes are discovered and remedied. We examine a case study at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, involving the calibration of DC standard resistors of value 100 MOhm and 1 GOhm. Results from the period 2001 to 2015 were in error by approximately 0.7 parts per million (ppm), with quoted uncertainties (k=2) of 0.4 ppm and 1.6 ppm respectively. Inter-comparisons did not detect the error, mainly because the uncertainty due to the transportation drift of the comparison standards was too large to resolve it. Likewise, research into single-electron current standards did not detect the error because at this resistance value it was on the borderline of statistical significance. The key event was a comparison between PTB (Germany) and NPL (UK) of a new small-current measuring instrument, the ultrastable low-noise current amplifier (ULCA). At that time, the transport stability of the ULCA was not well established. Nevertheless, calibrations of the ULCA at NPL using a 100 MOhm resistor were sufficiently discrepant with the PTB calibrations to motivate a thorough investigation into the NPL traceability chain, which uncovered the error. This instructive episode illustrates a positive interplay between calibration and research activities and shows that cutting-edge calibration uncertainties must be supported by a vigorous research programme. It is also important for NMIs to maintain a comfortable buffer (at least a factor of 10) between their claimed uncertainty and the uncertainty that their customers require, so that small errors can be resolved without significant impact on measurement stakeholders.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of the LAPPD Gen-II, a large-area microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) equipped with a capacitively coupled sensing (readout) electrode. Two detector variants with different geometries and materials were investigated using a picosecond pulsed laser system. We measured the single-photon timing response and spatial charge distribution on segmented readout electrodes. The prompt timing peak exhibits a resolution of approximately 30 ps, with the overall timing structure explained by photoelectron propagation and back-scattering effects from the MCP input surface. We developed analytical models that describe the propagation of photoelectrons and the induced charge spread on the sensing electrodes, including secondary electron backscattering from the resistive anode. The model accurately reproduces the measured device properties and enables performance extrapolations for various detector geometries and dielectric properties. These results provide a predictive framework for optimizing MCP-PMTs for timing- and imaging-critical applications such as RICH detectors in high-energy physics and TOF-PET systems for medical imaging.

TL;DR: This paper extends the Pyragas time-delayed feedback control (TDFC) to random dynamical systems and shows that noise-induced chaos can lead to transitions between stable and unstable regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are likely motivated by the desire to understand how control mechanisms like Pyragas TDFC can be applied to more complex, random dynamical systems rather than just deterministic ones. Understanding such applications could open up new possibilities for controlling chaos in noisy environments.

Method: The authors likely used a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. They would have studied the Lyapunov exponents of the systems under investigation, such as the random logistic map and the stochastic Rössler system, to determine the stability and behavior of the systems under the extended Pyragas TDFC.

Result: The main finding is that in random dynamical systems, the addition of noise (which can induce chaos) can cause a transition from a stable regime to an unstable one due to a phenomenon specific to these systems.

Conclusion: This work broadens the application of Pyragas TDFC control to random dynamical systems and reveals the role of noise-induced chaos in driving system transitions. These findings could be significant for fields such as climate modeling, biological systems, and other areas where randomness plays a key role in system behavior.

Abstract: We extend the Pyragas time-delayed feedback control (TDFC) to apply it to random dynamical systems and introduce an extended classification based on Lyapunov exponents and trajectory fluctuations. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using the random logistic map and the stochastic Rössler system. Our results reveal that noise-induced chaos triggers a transition from stable to unstable regimes based on a phenomenon inherent to random dynamical systems.

Abstract: We computationally study the response of zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) to streamwise step changes from a smooth wall to riblets (S-R), and vice versa (R-S). We consider triangular riblets with tip angle $90^o$ (T9), that increase drag, with viscous-scaled spacing $50$. A novel grid-generation approach is developed for unstructured spectral-element codes, consistent with the size of turbulent scales across the TBL. We generate a ZPG TBL upstream of the step change (with thickness $δ_0$) with momentum thickness Reynolds number $Re_{θ_0} \simeq 680$. The TBL departure from equilibrium due to the step change, and its subsequent relaxation, recall previous studies on step changes in surface roughness. Downstream of the R-S step change, the internal equilibrium layer thickness $δ_{IEL}$ reaches $0.4 δ_0$ within $12δ_0$. However, downstream of the S-R step change $δ_{IEL}$ reaches $0.4 δ_0$ within $4δ_0$. In all cases, $δ_{IEL}$ does not reach the boundary layer thickness, even up to a distance of $45δ_0$ downstream of the step change, owing to persistent history effects within the frozen wake region.

Abstract: We conduct direct numerical simulations of separating turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) over triangular riblets with tip angles $90^o$ (T9) and $60^o$ (T6). Our setup follows the separating TBL study of Wu et al.\ ({\it J. Fluid Mech.}, vol.\ 883, 2020, p.\ A45). An equilibrium zero pressure-gradient (ZPG) TBL is generated at a reference location, followed by imposition of a Gaussian suction profile to create a separation bubble. The ZPG TBLs over the riblets and the benchmark smooth case have matched momentum thickness Reynolds number $Re_{θ_0} = 583$ (friction Reynolds number 224). We employ a well-validated spectral-element solver, and leverage its unstructured-grid nature to generate an optimal grid, based on the size of turbulent scales across the TBL. At the reference location, the T9 and T6 riblets respectively increase and reduce drag, with viscous-scaled spacings $52$ and $13$. We discover that for both riblet cases, the mean separation location occurs at a distance of $140θ_0$ downstream of the reference location, $18\%$ shorter than the mean separation distance for the smooth case ($170θ_0$). This outcome is related to the progressive enhancement of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) rollers over the riblets, owing to the continuous rise in the adverse pressure-gradient. The KH rollers penetrate into the turbulent separation bubble, with significantly larger size and coherence compared to their counterparts upstream of the mean separation location.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the long-term reliability and safety of space-based solar cells, understanding how different types of radiation impact them is crucial.

Method: A Geant4 Monte Carlo model was developed to simulate the dose of charge and energy deposition caused by electrons, protons, and X-rays in satellite solar cell materials. The model was validated against existing experimental and computational data.

Result: The study revealed that low-energy X-rays primarily cause damage to the surface layers of the solar cell, while high-energy particles can penetrate deeper into the semiconductor and substrate, risking component failure. The findings provide insights into radiation effects in space environments and inform the design of shielding strategies for space solar cells.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the need for tailored radiation shielding strategies to protect solar cells from various types of radiation encountered in space environments.

Abstract: Understanding radiation effects in spacecraft components is critical for predicting long-term performance degradation. In this work, a Geant4 Monte Carlo model is developed to compute charge and energy deposition in satellite solar-cell materials exposed to electrons, protons, and X-ray environments. The model is validated against published experimental and computational benchmarks and shows strong agreement across multiple energy ranges. Power-density deposition profiles are then evaluated for a multi-layer solar-cell structure under blackbody soft X-rays, mono-energetic X-rays, and high-energy electrons. The results show that low-energy X-rays dominate damage in surface layers, while high-energy particles penetrate deeper into semiconductor and substrate layers, posing risk to electronic components. These findings highlight the importance of radiation-specific shielding strategies for space solar-cell design.

Abstract: In solid-state nanopores, achieving reliable control over pore aperture opening and closing (gating) remains a major challenge. Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microwave ovens with frequency-selective heating are becoming more common, but achieving efficient and uniform heating remains a challenge. This paper addresses these issues through a novel magnetron injection-locked system.

Method: The magnetron is treated as a two-port oscillator with filament structures used for injection locking. A self-designed injection structure allows the microwave to enter the resonant cavity through filament leads, utilizing intrinsic isolation for a compact design. Two injection structures are tested.

Result: The system achieves a maximum locking bandwidth of 0.7 MHz at an injection ratio of 0.2, with a 28% reduction in weight and 16% reduction in volume. The magnetron output is reliably locked by an external signal, demonstrating the system's stability and potential applications in future microwave ovens.

Conclusion: The proposed system represents a significant advancement in microwave magnetron design, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for microwave ovens with frequency-selective heating.

Abstract: A novel injection-locked S-band microwave oven magnetron system is proposed, analyzed, and experimented. The magnetron is considered as a two-port oscillator, and the filament structures of it are used as a port for injection locking. To our knowledge, it is the first time that microwaves have been injected through magnetron filaments. The microwave is injected into the magnetron filter box using a self-designed injection structure, entering the resonant cavity through filament leads. The intrinsic isolation between the magnetrons output and filament is utilized as an isolator. No waveguide circulators or couplers between the injection source and the magnetron were used in the system, resulting in low cost and compact injection locking. Two types of injection structures were performed. The maximum locking bandwidth of 0.7 MHz was achieved at an injection ratio of 0.2. The weight and volume of the proposed injection-locked magnetron system were reduced to 28% and 16%, respectively. The magnetron output is successfully locked by an external signal. The experiment results reveal that the proposed low-cost injection-locked oven magnetron system works reliably. It has significant potential applications for future microwave ovens with frequency-selective heating to improve both efficiency and uniformity.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效、可持续的方法来处理高浓度 slurry，具有重要的环保意义和工业应用潜力。

Abstract: Drying concentrated slurry waste is slow, particularly due to the entrapment and limited accessibility of water entrained between the particles in the slurry. A sailboat evaporator with a root-like structure is a new system that enables wind-assisted interfacial evaporation of concentrated particle slurries. In this work, we create access to the disconnected water pockets in concentrated slurry waste, facilitating faster water conduction and efficient evaporation at extremely high solid concentration. The evaporator's long roots effectively extracted water beneath 150 cm deep supernatant water layer. Through replantation of the evaporator to a separate location, an impressive evaporation rate (ER) of 4 kg/(m^2*h) close to 80 wt% solid concentration, a 25% increase to a non-replanted sample. Furthermore, long periods of efficient of evaporation was achieved even at high solid concentration through hydrodynamic flushing of roots. Outdoor experiments achieved substantial volumetric reduction, yielding dried residues with over 75 wt% solid concentration. These results underscore the system's reliable performance against highly concentrated slurries, yet to be by conventional industrial methods, including flocculation and tail-lift drying. The integration of renewable energy coupled with efficient enhancement techniques makes the sailboat evaporator a scalable and sustainable pathway for industrial wastewater dewatering.

TL;DR: They measured three-body recombination near a 159 GHz p-wave Feshbach resonance using ultracold ${}^{6}$Li atoms, resolving orbital contributions and successfully modeling the results with thermally-averaged cascade-recombination theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of few-body losses in ultracold atomic systems is key to advancing theories of quantum phase transitions and few-body physics, especially in systems with Feshbach resonances.

Method: They used an ultracold gas of ${}^{6}$Li atoms in their lowest hyperfine state, coupled with a radio-frequency gated protocol to suppress magnetic field transients to below 1 milligauss. Orbital-resolved measurements were performed near the 159 GHz p-wave Feshbach resonance.

Result: The three-body loss coefficient $L_3$ was well captured by a thermally-averaged cascade-recombination model, allowing for the extraction of the resonance splitting δB = 7.6(3) mG and effective-range parameter $k_e$ = 0.151(6) $a_0^{-1}$. These values are in quantitative agreement with coupled-channel theory.

Conclusion: These results establish orbital-resolved three-body spectroscopy as a precise tool for studying p-wave scattering and validate microscopic models of resonant few-body loss, offering a new method to probe quantum systems with Feshbach resonances.

Abstract: We report precision, orbital-resolved measurements of three-body recombination near the 159~G $p$-wave Feshbach resonance in an ultracold gas of $^{6}$Li atoms prepared in their lowest hyperfine state. Using a radio-frequency gated protocol that suppresses magnetic-field transients below the milligauss level, we resolve loss features associated with the $|m_\ell|=1$ and $m_\ell=0$ orbital projections. The measured three-body loss coefficient $L_3$ is well captured by a thermally averaged cascade-recombination model, enabling extraction of the resonance splitting $δB$ and effective-range parameter $k_e$. At the lowest temperature, we obtain $δB = 7.6(3)$~mG and $k_e = 0.151(6)\,a_0^{-1}$, both in quantitative agreement with coupled-channel theory. These results establish orbital-resolved three-body spectroscopy as a precision probe of $p$-wave scattering and provide a benchmark for microscopic models of resonant few-body loss.

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The study successfully creates large numbers of ultracold $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K Feshbach molecules, with up to $1.1 	imes 10^4$ molecules formed by radio-frequency association. The molecules have a broad resonance width, allowing for robust control of interactions. The lifetime of these molecules. exceeds 2 ms, but decreases to about 7 ms after $^{23}$Na is removed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to create ultracold dipolar bosons for researching strongly interacting quantum systems.

Method: The RF association technique was used to combine $^{23}$Na and $^{41}$K atoms into molecules. They measured the binding energy and the lifetime of the molecules in both presence and absence of background atoms.

Result: The creation of a high number of molecules coupled with a broad resonance width and long molecule lifetimes demonstrate strong dipolar interactions.

Conclusion: This achievement is a crucial step towards studying many-body phenomena in strongly dipolar Bose gases.

Abstract: Ultracold Feshbach molecules are a crucial intermediate step for the creation of quantum degenerate gases of strongly dipolar molecules. After coherent transfer to the rovibrational ground state, these dimers can realize stable dipolar gases with strong, tunable long-range interactions. Here, we report the creation of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K Feshbach molecules by radio-frequency (RF) association. An RF pulse applied on the molecular side of an interspecies Feshbach resonance at 73.6(1)~G associates up to $1.1(1)\times10^4$ molecules from a thermal mixture of $^{23}$Na and $^{41}$K atoms. Measurements of the binding energy reveal a broad resonance width of 5.1(2)~G, facilitating robust control over interspecies interactions. The molecule lifetime in the presence of background atoms exceeds 2~ms, extending to 7~ms after removal of $^{23}$Na. These results constitute a key step toward the production of ultracold $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K ground state molecules for the exploration of novel many-body phenomena in strongly dipolar Bose gases.
