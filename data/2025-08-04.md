### [1] [Explicit equivalence between the spectral localizer and local Chern and winding markers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00214)
*Lucien Jezequel,Jens H. Bardarson,Adolfo G. Grushin*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓扑绝缘体在材料科学中是一个重要研究方向，特别是在理解无平移对称性系统时，寻找有效的分类方法非常关键。这篇论文通过引入谱局部化器的参数展开，展示了不同不变量之间的等价性，有助于更广泛的物理学家理解和应用这些概念。

Method: 作者使用了一个基于Clifford代数展开的方法，具体展开谱局部化器，分析其各阶项，从而证明了不同不变量之间的等价性。

Result: 结果表明，Chern和winding数等拓扑不变量可以从谱局部化器的展开式中自然导出，从而提供了一种更直接的方法来计算这些量。

Conclusion: 结论是，通过系统地展开谱局部化器，可以简单明了地推导出不同拓扑不变量之间的关系，这大大简化了理解这类复杂系统的任务。

Abstract: Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological
invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational
symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or
amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions
of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral
localizer invariant.
  However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here,
we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative
expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By
leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that
Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It
bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible
to a broader physics audience.

### [2] [The Quadrupole Moment of Higher-Order Topological Insulator at Finite temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00277)

Result: 温度影响相变，无序散射能驱动相变，类似 Anderson 转变。

Conclusion: 有限温度下高阶拓扑绝缘体的相变由温度和无序参数共同决定。

Abstract: We study the higher-order topological insulators at finite temperature based
on a generalized real-space quadrupole moment, which extends the ground state
expectations to ensemble averages. Our study reveals that chiral symmetry alone
dictates that the quadrupole moment must be quantized to two values of $0$ and
$1/2$, even at finite temperature. It is found that finite temperature can
induce a topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial. Furthermore,
we found that the anisotropic intra-cell hopping can lead to a reentrant
topological phase transition, in which the system becomes topological again
with rising temperature. This reentrant behavior is in stark contrast to the
results at zero temperature. We also investigate the effects of the
quasi-disorder hopping on the topology. It is found that the initially trivial
system can be driven into a topological phase with strong enough disorder
strength, which closely resembles the topological Anderson transition. Our work
provides an example for studying the finite temperature topology of
higher-order topological insulators.

Abstract: Quantum materials exhibiting phase transitions which can be controlled
through external stimuli, such as electric fields, are promising for future
computing technologies beyond conventional semiconductor transistors. Devices
that take advantage of structural phase transitions have inherent built-in
memory, reminiscent of synapses and neurons, and are thus natural candidates
for neuromorphic computing. Of particular interest are phase-change oxides,
which allow for control over the metal-to-insulator transition. Here, we report
X-ray nano-diffraction structural imaging of micro-devices fabricated with the
archetypal phase-change material vanadium sesquioxide (V$_2$O$_3$). The devices
contain a Ga ion-irradiated region where the metal-to-insulator transition
critical temperature is lowered, a useful feature for controlling neuron-like
spiking behavior. Results show that strain, induced by crystal lattice mismatch
between the pristine and irradiated material, leads to a suppression of the
metal-to-insulator-transition. Suppression occurs within the irradiated region
or along its edges, depending on the defect-distribution and the size of the
region. The observed self-straining effect could extend to other phase-change
oxides and dominate as device dimensions are reduced and become too small to
dissipate strain within the irradiated region. The findings are important for
phase engineering in phase-change devices and highlight the necessity to study
phase transitions at the nanoscale.

TL;DR: The paper discusses hole silicon spin qubits and their potential for efficient CMOS quantum computation, demonstrating high gate fidelities and suggesting future limitations if not leveraging more advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abundance of semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure makes gate-defined silicon qubits promising for large-scale quantum computing. Quantumdots provide more complex spin physics compared to electrons, but hole-based qubits offer more controlled and scalable alternatives. However, previous work on hole qubits is less promising, so further exploration is needed. This paper aims to address this through experiments in hole qubits with configurable exchange interactions that could offer complex multiqubit operations. They are implemented in identical hardware as the best electron-based qubits, which would open up the possibility of applying this technology to quantum CMOS architectures which are currently a limiting factor in quantum computing efforts.

Method: The authors of the paper perform a series of experiments in hole spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots. They employ fast qubit control, exchange pulsing, and utilize industrial-grade fabrication methods. The authors purify the silicon wafers to reduce isotopic scattering and device-level optimizations were applied to improve qubit operation. They also generate a detailed analysis of the spin-spin exchange couplings in the devices, and compute the resulting Hamiltonian to provide an accurate description of the qubit operation.

Result: The results of the paper indicate that the hole qubits performed exceptionally well, with single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.8% and two-qubit gate quality factors in the vicinity of 240. The corresponding gate fidelities for the two-qubit operations are nearly 100%. These results imply that the qubit operation is nearly perfect, which suggests a physical limit approached, and are the best obtained in natural silicon to date.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that hole spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots are a superior candidate to continue the development of quantum CMOS architectures compared to prior qubit designs. Experiments indicate that they can operate with nearly perfect fidelities, but the dimensionally extensive nature of spin-spin exchange couplings will limit their scalability unless further advanced techniques are employed.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots leverage established
semiconductor infrastructure and offer a scalable path toward transformative
quantum technologies. Holes spins in silicon offer compact all-electrical
control, whilst retaining all the salient features of a quantum dot qubit
architecture. However, silicon hole spin qubits are not as advanced as
electrons, due to increased susceptibility to disorder and more complex spin
physics. Here we demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities up to 99.8% and a
two-qubit gate quality factor of 240, indicating a physical fidelity limit of
99.7%. These results represent the highest performance reported in natural
silicon to date, made possible by fast qubit control, exchange pulsing, and
industrial-grade fabrication. Notably, we achieve these results in a
near-identical device as used for highly reproducible, high-fidelity electron
spin qubits. With isotopic purification and device-level optimisations in the
future, our hole spin qubits are poised to unlock a new operation regime for
quantum CMOS architectures.

### [5] [Localized states and skin effect around non-Hermitian impurities in tight-binding models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00519)

Motivation: 探索一维晶格杂质如何影响局域态的存在与能隙结构，特别是在Hermitian与非-Hermitian情况下的差异。

Method: 使用广义波利克定理分析局域态分布、能隙及分数态特性，通过边界条件求解并分析不同参数下的能级分布状态。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了一维Hermitian和非-Hermitian晶格系统中杂质对局域态的影响。通过调整参数，在Hybrid情况下能够实现半局域化状态。这对理解非-Hermitian系统中的局域化机制和能隙结构具有重要意义。

Abstract: We use the generalized Bloch theorem formalism of Alase {\it et al.} [{\it
Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 117} 076804 (2016)] to analyze simple one-dimensional
tight-binding lattice systems connected by Hermitian bonds (all with the same
hopping parameter $t$), but containing one bond impurity which can be either
Hermitian or non-Hermitian. We calculate the band structure, the bulk-boundary
correspondence indicator ($D_L(\epsilon)$) and analyze the eigenvalues of the
lattice translation operator ($z$), for each eigenstate. From the $z$ values
the generalized Brillouin zone can be reconstructed. If the impurity is
Hermitian (and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric), we find a parameter regime in which
two localized edge states separate from the tight-binding band. We then
simulate a non-Hermitian impurity by keeping hopping in one direction of the
bond impurity the same as the rest of the tight-binding system, and varying
only its reciprocal. Again, we find a region with localized edge states, but in
this case the energy eigenvalues are purely imaginary. We also find that in
this case the two zero energy eigenvectors coalesce, hence this system is an
exceptional line. We then perform an interpolative scan between the above two
scenarios and find that there is an intermediate region exhibiting a
non-Hermitian skin effect. In this region a macroscopic fraction of states
acquire complex energy eigenvalues and exhibit localization towards the
impurity. Our numerical results are supported by a detailed analysis of the
solutions of the boundary/impurity equation.

Abstract: Manipulation of directional magnon propagation, known as magnon spin current,
is essential for developing magnonic memory and logic devices featuring
nonvolatile functionalities and ultralow power consumption. Magnon spin current
can usually be modulated by magnetic field or current-induced spin torques.
However, these approaches may lead to energy dissipation caused by Joule
heating. Electric-field switching of magnon spin current without charge current
is highly desired but very challenging to realize. By integrating magnonic and
piezoelectric materials, we demonstrate manipulation of the magnon spin current
generated by the spin Seebeck effect in the ferrimagnetic insulator Gd3Fe5O12
(GdIG) film on a piezoelectric substrate. We observe reversible electric-field
switching of magnon polarization without applied charge current. Through
strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling, the electric field induces the
magnetic compensation transition between two magnetic states of the GdIG,
resulting in its magnetization reversal and the simultaneous switching of
magnon spin current. Our work establishes a prototype material platform that
pave the way for developing magnon logic devices characterized by all electric
field reading and writing and reveals the underlying physics principles of
their functions.

Conclusion: 该研究为材料科学和生物医学等领域中的微纳尺度光表征和成像技术提供了新的思路和可能的解决方案。 This research offers a new approach for micro/nan尺度 optical characterization and imaging across various fields like materials science and biomedicine.

Abstract: Nonlinear optical phenomena such as parametric amplification and frequency
conversion are typically driven by external optical fields. Free electrons can
also act as electromagnetic sources, offering unmatched spatial precision.
Combining optical and electron-induced fields via the nonlinear response of
material structures therefore holds potential for revealing new physical
phenomena and enabling disruptive applications. Here, we theoretically
investigate wave mixing between external light and the evanescent fields of
free electrons, giving rise to inelastic photon scattering mediated by the
second-order nonlinear response of a specimen. Specifically, an incident photon
may be blue- or red-shifted, while the passing electron correspondingly loses
or gains energy. These processes are strongly enhanced when the frequency shift
matches an optical resonance of the specimen. We present a general theoretical
framework to quantify the photon conversion probability and demonstrate its
application by revealing far-infrared vibrational fingerprints of retinal using
only visible light. Beyond its fundamental interest, this phenomenon offers a
practical approach for spatially mapping low-frequency excitations with
nanometer resolution using visible photon energies and existing electron
microscopes.

Motivation: 探索超导体、自旋轨道 coupling材料的非线性输运响应特性，有助于深入理解材料性质并指导实验设计。

Method: 使用半经典动力学理论，结合电导率守恒和与动量相关的散射机制，模拟SO-NCM中的输运响应。

Result: 发现非线性霍尔效应（CNLH）表现出对磁场的二次依赖性，并且磁场方向和异缘散射类型影响响应的强度和符号。此外，倾斜能带导致方向磁偏转，呈现弱和强两种情况。

Conclusion: 为SO-NCM中的材料科学和条件优化提供了新的启示。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to WSMs, but are
also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled
noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the
origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal
property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in
SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the
Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and
momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic
and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the
chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic
quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for
both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to
enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal,
but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt
in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a
magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into
weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial
directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external
magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing
the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be
tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.

### [10] [A compact quasi-zero stiffness metamaterial based on monolithic shells for vibration isolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00310)
*Yong Zhang,Xianfeng Chen*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new QZS metamaterial without combining two components, using monolithic shell geometry and nonlinear deformation to achieve quasi-zero stiffness. They study the effects of geometry parameters on static and dynamic responses, and experimentally demonstrate low-frequency vibration isolation. This approach can be extended for broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop advanced vibration isolation materials, which are crucial for reducing external vibrations in various engineering fields like aerospace and civil engineering.

Method: The method used is a combination of experimental and numerical simulations to analyze the static and dynamic responses of the new QZS design and optimize its geometry for ideal performance.

Result: The result shows that the new QZS metamaterial achieves exceptional low-frequency vibration isolation, indicating potential for practical applications.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this novel approach offers a simpler and efficient way to create QZS metamaterials, which can be extended to create more complex vibration isolation systems with multiple zero-stiffness features.

Abstract: Quasi-zero stiffness (QZS) metamaterials are highly effective in isolating
objects from low-frequency external vibrations, due to their high static
stiffness but low dynamic stiffness characteristics. Traditionally, QZS
metamaterials are designed by combining a negative-stiffness part with a
positive-stiffness counterpart. Here, we present a novel QZS metamaterial
design without relying on combining two components. The QZS characteristic is
achieved solely through monolithic shell elements' unique geometry and
nonlinear deformation. Using experimental and numerical approaches, we
investigate the static and dynamic responses of the proposed metamaterials as a
function of their geometric parameters. We then tune the structure's geometry
to achieve ideal zero-stiffness behaviors and experimentally demonstrate an
exceptional low-frequency vibration isolation mechanism. This concept can be
further utilized as a building block for constructing metamaterials with
multiple zero-stiffness features, enabling a broad range of applications.

TL;DR: This paper successfully demonstrates a 2D spin-LED using CrSBr, with effects from spin-flip and spin-canting transitions. The combination of magnetic order and spintronic transport leads to versatile light emission behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of integrating spin transitions into opto-spintronic applications by showcasing a functional spin-LED, which is a crucial step towards practical opto-spintronic devices.

Method: The authors used 2D semiconducting magnet CrSBr to create the spin-LED. They demonstrated electroluminescence down to bilayers and showed how spin-flip and spin-canting transitions affect the EL characteristics.

Result: The spin-LED exhibits EL that is influenced by spin-flip (hysteretic behavior) and spin-canting (continuous, anisotropic modulation). This opens new possibilities for opto-spintronic functionalities.

Conclusion: This breakthrough supports the integration of 2D magnetic semiconductors into opto-spintronic applications, paving the way for practical and versatile opto-spintronic devices with strong prospects for future developments.

Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors represent
transformative platforms to explore magneto-optics and opto-spintronic
applications. Though 2D opto-spintronics has attracted tremendous research
efforts in spin-dependent photodetectors and non-volatile memory components,
the realization of one core application - spin-modulated light-emitting device
(spin-LED) - remains elusive so far. Here we successfully realize prototype
spin-LED integrated with a 2D semiconducting magnet CrSBr, demonstrating
considerable electroluminescence (EL) down to bilayers. Intriguingly, the EL of
the spin-LED is discovered to be directly manipulated by spin-flip and
spin-canting transitions. Notably, spin-flip transitions enable unprecedented
hysteretic behaviors of EL characteristics, while spin-canting transitions
induce EL continuous modulation with robust anisotropy. This versatile
manipulation is originated from the synergy of magnetic-order mediated
excitonic transitions and spintronic transport. The prototype demonstration of
spin-LED establishes an indispensable scheme of opto-spintronic devices
leveraging 2D spin transitions and strong excitonic effects, presenting a
critical step towards integrated 2D opto-spintronics.

### [12] [Fermion selective tests of new physics with the bound electron g-factor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00685)
*Matteo Moretti,Christoph H. Keitel,Zoltán Harman*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: Analyzing the abstract, the study explores using high-precision measurements of the $g$ factor in single-electron ions to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. They examine the contribution of a hypothetical scalar boson's exchange to the $g$ factor, deriving bounds on its parameters. By employing nuclide shifts similar to isotope shifts, they aim to enhance experimental sensitivity. Their results suggest that the coupling constants for electron-proton interactions can be constrained with much higher precision compared to current data, leading to significant improvements in understanding beyond the Standard Model physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper seems to be about using fundamental physics measurements to explore beyond the Standard Model. The study of $g$ factors, which are critical in quantum electrodynamics, is extended to include hypothetical new forces. The motivation is to find evidence or constraints that could indicate the existence of new physics beyond what's currently accepted in particle physics.

Method: The methodology involves calculating the contribution of a scalar boson exchange to the $g$ factor for H-like ions. They compare ground state measurements and use nuclide shifts to increase sensitivity. This likely involves precise theoretical calculations and analysis of existing experimental data, possibly simulating different scenarios to tighten the bounds on the new physics parameters.

Result: The results indicate that by combining high-precision measurements with nuclide shifts, they significantly improve the constraints on the coupling constants of hypothetical scalar bosons interacting with electrons and protons. This could mean that the bounds are tighter by up to three orders of magnitude compared to what is currently achievable, which is a major advancement in constraining beyond Standard Model physics.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this approach using precise $g$ factor measurements and nuclide shifts provides a powerful tool for exploring new physics. The study successfully demonstrates that these methods can constrain interaction parameters of scalar bosons with high precision, opening up new avenues for research in beyond Standard Model physics.

Abstract: The use of high-precision measurements of the $g$ factor of single-electron
ions is considered as a detailed probe for physics beyond the Standard Model.
The contribution of the exchange of a hypothetical force-carrying scalar boson
to the $g$ factor is calculated for the ground state of H-like ions and used to
derive bounds on the parameters of that force. Similarly to the isotope shift,
we employ the nuclide shift, i.e. the difference for elements with different
proton and/or neutron numbers, in order to increase the experimental
sensitivity to the new physics contribution. In particular we find, combining
available measurements with current precision with different ions, that the
coupling constant for the interaction between an electron and a proton can be
constrained up to three orders of magnitude better than with the best current
atomic data and theory.

Conclusion: 这项研究为动态系统稳定性提供了新的理论框架和控制方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Stability is a fundamental concept that refers to a system's ability to
return close to its original state after disturbances. The minimal conditions
for stability when system parameters vary in time, though common in physics,
have been largely overlooked. Here, we study the minimal amount of periodic
stiffness a linear mass-spring system requires to remain stable and apply our
findings to optimally trap the upside-down state of a compass in a time-varying
magnetic field. We show that the ability to return close to its original state
only needs to be ensured over small but precisely defined durations within each
period for the system to achieve dynamic stability. These precise durations
form a discrete set, remarkably predicted by rules analogous to those of
quantum mechanics. This unexpected connection opens new avenues for controlling
dynamical systems.

Abstract: By theoretical derivation, we constructed an inhomogeneous coefficient
equation to correctly describing harmonic radiation in solids induced by a
spatially inhomogeneous field, where the widely used semiconductor Bloch
equation fails. This equation has superiority over the semiconductor Bloch
equation with good applicability to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields.
Using graphene as an example, it is found that under inhomogeneous field
driving, even-order harmonics occur with an enhancing tendency as the field
inhomogeneity increases. As for the second-order harmonic, its intensity
dependence is consistent with the prediction from the perturbation theory, and
its wavelength dependence can use to directly distinguish the relative
contribution of intraband and interband transitions. The inhomogeneous
coefficient equation provides a direct theoretical analysis tool for
elucidating the physical mechanism of inhomogeneous field induced harmonic
radiation in solids.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Scandium-doped aluminum nitride has recently emerged as a promising material
for quantum photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its unique combination
of strong second-order nonlinearity, ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility. However, the
relatively high optical loss reported to date-typically above 2.4 dB/cm-remains
a key challenge that limits its widespread application in low-loss PICs. Here,
we present a monolithically integrated $\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{N}_4$-ScAlN
waveguide platform that overcomes this limitation. By confining light within an
etched $\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{N}_4$ waveguide while preserving the functional
properties of the underlying ScAlN layer, we achieve an intrinsic quality
factor of $Q_{\mathrm{i}} = 3.35 \times 10^5$, corresponding to a propagation
loss of 1.03 dB/cm-comparable to that of commercial single-mode
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides. This hybrid architecture enables
low-loss and scalable fabrication while retaining the advanced functionalities
offered by ScAlN, such as ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. Our results
establish a new pathway for ScAlN-based PICs with potential applications in
high-speed optical communication, modulation, sensing, nonlinear optics, and
quantum optics within CMOS-compatible platforms.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses blue-detuned Kerr solitons (DKS) in a coupled-ring microresonator, showing how they can act as frequency combs with reduced thermal noise and high efficiency, eliminating auxiliary lasers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing the behavior of DKS in high-Q microresonators and their applicability as frequency combs despite thermal noise.

Method: Experiments with a coupled-ring microresonator, using pumped laser with AMX-induced dispersion to generate DKS in blue detuned regime, measuring noise reduction and conversion efficiency.

Result: Achieved up to 14.5 dB reduction in phase noise and 37% conversion efficiency.

Conclusion: Blue-detuned DKS is a stable and efficient method for integrated microcombs that eliminates the need for auxiliary cooling lasers.

Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) generated in high-Q microresonators driven
by continuous-wave (CW) lasers provide chip-scale optical frequency combs
composed of mutually coherent CW lines. However, their small mode volume makes
them highly susceptible to thermal fluctuations, and the resulting
thermo-refractive noise (TRN) perturbs the repetition rate $f_{\rm rep}$. Here,
we experimentally demonstrate a blue-detuned DKS in a coupled-ring
microresonator. By employing avoided-mode-crossing (AMX)-induced dispersion
engineering at the pump mode, DKSs are generated even when the pump laser is
tuned to the higher-frequency (blue) side of the resonance. In this regime, the
pump laser not only seeds DKS formation but also serves as a cooling laser for
the thermally sensitive pumped mode. We observe a self-cooling effect that
reduces the phase noise of $f_{\rm rep}$ by up to 14.5 dB, while achieving a
pump-to-comb conversion efficiency as high as 37 %. These results establish
blue-detuned DKSs as a thermally robust and power-efficient solution for
integrated microcomb systems, eliminating the need for auxiliary lasers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses challenges in high-NA EUV lithography by proposing an innovative optical system that minimizes mask 3D effects and improves exposure speed and precision. The system's design and performance are evaluated, highlighting its potential for applications in semiconductor manufacturing. 

Method: The paper describes the optical design of a four-mirror inline projector, utilizing a double-stage concave-convex pair to cancel optical aberrations and reduce distortions. The system uses dual-line scan illumination to bypass central obscuration. The results include a circular exposure area with specific NA values and a comparison of the benefits of using a step motor versus a scanner in terms of productivity and electric consumption.

Result: The proposed system successfully eliminates the most significant mask 3D effect, achieving high NA values with good uniformity and wavefront performance. However, the trade-offs in using a step motor include a smaller exposure area, increased costs, and complexities in the production process. The system shows potential for high productivity in semiconductor manufacturing despite these limitations.

Conclusion: The four-mirror inline projector offers a promising solution for high-NA EUV lithography by effectively addressing mask 3D effects and optimizing exposure speed and precision. However, further research is needed to address the limitations associated with step motor usage and explore alternative illumination methods to maintain high productivity in semiconductor manufacturing applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a simple, four-mirror, in-line projector for high-NA EUV
lithography that eliminates the most troublesome mask 3D effect. The design
consists of a two-stage concave-convex pair, where optical aberrations are
cancelled within each stage and between them, in a manner similar to that of a
double-Gauss lens. The light rays pass through the central aperture in each
mirror with acceptable obscuration. The numerical aperture (NA) is 0.5 and 0.7
for Hyper-NA. It has a circular exposure field with a diameter of 26 mm. The
residual radial distortion is rather high at a few microns at the field rim,
and the scan motion causes image blurring. Thus, we need to revert to the
stepper design, and the field becomes smaller, i.e. 18 mm x 18 mm square.
However, this brings an important benefit: we can remove the scanning mechanism
from the photomask side. It is important to note that both the wafer and the
photomask remain stationary during the EUV exposure. This guarantees superior
overlay control and results in enhanced productivity. This approach serves to
simplify the system and reduce electrical consumption also. Illumination will
be provided through two rectangular scan-mirrors located in front of the mask,
providing dual line scan field, which matches with off-axis illumination
enhancing the resolution and bypasses the central obscurations.

### [18] [Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00503)
*Daniel Voigt,Oliver Gerberding*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper approaches the issue of stray light in interferometers, aiming to suppress it by using tunable coherence. They improve upon previous work by boosting modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz, reducing coherence length and successfully demonstrating suppression in both interferometers and power-recycled Michelson setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stray or reflected light, though not intentionally directed at sensors, poses significant challenges by introducing non-linear noise in precision interferometers. For space-based gravitational wave detectors, mitigating this issue is critical, especially as they approach sensitivity limits. This paper explores innovations in modulation techniques to suppress such noise.

Method: The authors enhance the modulation frequency of their tunable coherence technique to 10 GHz, a significant leap from their previous 67 MHz. They implement this in a Michelson interferometer and a power-recycled Michelson design. Simulation and analysis are used to predict performance, and experiments are conducted to validate suppression effectiveness and coherence metrics.

Result: By increasing the modulation frequency to 10 GHz, the paper successfully reduces the residual coherence of interferometers to a few centimeters, eventually down to the laser's wavelength in a cavity. They achieve suppression of stray light and validate the enhanced noise suppression in a power-recycled setup.

Conclusion: This study represents a substantial step forward in managing stray light through innovative use of modulation techniques. By attaining such high modulation frequencies, the authors demonstrate effective suppression of noise, offering a reliable solution for future gravitational wave detectors facing stringent noise requirements. The expansion from interferometers to power-recycled systems suggests broader applicability and sets a foundation for even more advanced techniques in the future.

Abstract: By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces
non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as
preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort
is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways.
Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such
mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise.
However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation
techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future
observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray
light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique
to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For
these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable
suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by
the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we
demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation
frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few
centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength
in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a
power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light
in a more complex topology.

Conclusion:  developed a novel method for tuning light waves using pseudo-magnets and triaxial deformation, with potential in communication and sensing technologies.

Abstract: With the demonstrations of pseudo-magnetism in optical systems, the pursuits
of its practical applications require not only the use of pseudomagnetic fields
to create functional optical devices but also a reliable method to manipulate
pseudo-magnetism-affected light waves. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an
ultracompact Si-based cavity formed by triaxially deformed photonic honeycomb
lattices. The triaxial deformation could lead to Landau quantization, showing
the possibilities of realizing the localization and resonating of photons with
pseudomagnetic fields. Through adopting the Si waveguides for directional
coupling, we successfully obtain the transmission spectra for the proposed
cavities in the photonic integrated circuits. This opens a novel avenue for
highly efficient excitations and detections of Landau-quantized photonic
density of states, totally on chip. Moreover, we verify a linear electrical
tunability of -0.018 THz/mW for the pseudo-magnetism-induced optical resonant
states, fulfilling the manipulation of photons without varying deformations.
Our work introduces a mechanism for performing tunable light waves in triaxial
deformation-engineered systems, which enriches the design principles of

Abstract: Accurate in situ characterization of plasmonic materials dispersion and
efficiency remains a key challenge for next generation nanophotonic devices. To
this end, we introduce a platform leveraging extraordinary optical transmission

resonators to interrogate the optical response of plasmonic materials. We
implement direct E k dispersion mapping across a well defined set of optical
momenta by systematically varying the grating size, with each grating serving
as a discrete momentum-space probe. Non Hermitian modal decomposition is
carried out by means of the finite element method (FEM) and validated with
finite difference time domain (FDTD) to examine the eigenstates of the
plasmonic systems and analyze the modal hybridization within the aperture. The
interplay between the resonant mechanisms involved in the enhanced transmitted
field is investigated in both an idealized perfect electric conducting metal
and a realistic dispersive metal, emphasizing the aperture s role in mode
confinement and resonance shift. This approach provides an angle insensitive
platform for reliable, in situ and real time characterization of established

Conclusion: Born-Markov 主方程在光环境复杂性上存在局限性，需要更精确的模型特别是在强驱动和频率分裂时。

Abstract: In recent years, Born-Markov master equations based on tracing out the
electromagnetic degrees of freedom have been extensively employed in the
description of quantum optical phenomena originating from photon-mediated
interactions in quantum emitter ensembles. The breakdown of these effective
models, built on assumptions such as ensemble spectral homogeneity, an
unstructured photonic density of states, and weak light-matter coupling, has
also recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we investigate the
accuracy of this well-established framework beyond the most conventional, and
extensively explored, spontaneous emission configuration. Specifically, we
consider a system comprising two coherently driven and detuned quantum
emitters, embedded within a hybrid photonic-plasmonic cavity, formed by a
metallic nanorod integrated into a high-refractive-index dielectric
microresonator. The local density of photonic states in this structure exhibits
a complex frequency dependence, making it a compelling platform for exploring
photon-mediated interactions beyond the assumptions above. We benchmark this
modeling approach for the quantum dynamics of the emitter pair against exact
calculations based on a macroscopic field quantization formalism, providing an
illustrative assessment of its validity in significantly structured and
dispersive photonic environments. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes of
laser driving and frequency splitting that lead to markedly different levels of
accuracy in the effective model.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore and exploit the unique optical properties of plasmonic metasurfaces, particularly their polarization-dependent and enantiospecific responses, for various applications in sensing and optical manipulation.

Method: The study involves designing the metasurface with specific nanostructures, performing numerical simulations, fabricating the samples, and measuring their optical responses using techniques like near-field scanning microscopy and circular dichroism analysis.

Result: The results show measurable enantiospecific optical response, chiroptical effects in both near- and far-field, and the potential for label-free chiral sensing using differential circular dichroism with enantiomeric pairs.

Conclusion: This research enhances understanding of chiral optical behavior in planar plasmonic systems without requiring 3D structures and offers promising applications for sensing and optics.

Abstract: We present the design and optical characterization of a plasmonic metasurface
engineered to exhibit strong polarization anisotropy under both linearly and
circularly polarized light. The metasurface consists of geometrically
asymmetric gold nanostructures arranged periodically on a glass substrate. Each
nanostructure is formed by the fusion of three equilateral triangles. The
nanostructures simultaneously break mirror and inversion symmetries, resulting
in chiral and pseudo-chiral optical responses that manifest as linear and
circular polarization-dependent spectral features. Our numerical and
experimental results reveal clear chiroptical effects in both near- and
far-field. Near-field scanning optical microscopy confirms the excitation of
polarization-selective localized plasmonic modes, with spatially distinct
hot-spots lighting up under different incident polarizations. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the metasurface exhibits a measurable enantiospecific optical
response when coated with thin left- or right-handed chiral overlayers. The
differential circular dichroism signals observed in the presence of opposite
enantiomers highlight the potential of the metasurface for label-free chiral
sensing. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between
structural anisotropy, pseudo-chirality, and enantioselective interactions in
planar plasmonic systems. Our findings highlight the ability of planar
metasurfaces to emulate chiral optical behavior without requiring volumetric 3D

Additionally, they demonstrate on-chip label-free imaging of a 500-micron-thick optically-cleared mouse brain tissue slice.

approaches fail to accurately reconstruct highly scattering samples over
extended depths, which remains a critical challenge in optical imaging field.
Here, we introduce a gigavoxel-scale, multiple-scattering-aware LHT with a
large FOV (surpassing 0.6 cm2), millimeter-scale axial range and pixel level
(~2.4 micron) resolution. Our approach leverages a multi-wavelength,
oblique-illumination hologram reconstruction and a robust, automatic
illumination angle calibration, which are necessary for precise large-volume 3D
holographic reconstruction. Moreover, we propose optimization-driven
multi-slice tomographic framework to accurately capture multiple-scattering
effects outperforming first order Born/Rytov-based inversions. To rigorously
validate our method, we reconstruct bespoke multi-layer two-photon polymerized
test structure over a 1.7 mm imaging depth and 25 mm2 FOV, yielding an
unprecedented 3D space-bandwidth product exceeding a gigavoxel level.
Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time on-chip label-free imaging of
entire 500-micron-thick tissue slice of optically-cleared mouse brain. With the
proposed method, we aim to unlock powerful new capabilities for large-scale,
quantitative, label-free 3D imaging across biomedicine, neuroscience, material
sciences and beyond.

Abstract: It is challenging to distinguish Floquet Chern insulator (FCI) and Floquet
anomalous topological insulator (FATI) because of their common features of
chiral edge states and far away from equilibrium. A hybrid straight-curved
waveguide array is proposed to enable topological phase transitions from FCI to
FATI and show how to diagnose the two phases using Bloch oscillations. As a
proof of principle, the hybrid straight-curved waveguide array is designed as a
straight honeycomb waveguide array nested in an asynchronous curved Kagome
waveguide array. Under a two-dimensional (2D) tilted potential created by the
spatial gradient of refractive indices, an initial Gaussian-like wavepacket
undergoes 2D Bloch oscillations, displaying quasi-quantized displacement in the
FCI and no drift in the FATI. This approach offers a direct and unambiguous
method to diagnose Floquet topological phases from the bulk response.

Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) provides a powerful optical tool for
probing ultrafast dynamics on the attosecond timescale. While its mechanisms in
gases and solids are well-established, understanding nonlinear optical
responses in liquids remains challenging. The absence of long-range order in
liquids questions the applicability of the existing HHG models developed in
other media. Through combined experimental and theoretical investigations, we
identify unique characters of liquid-phase HHG -- spectral redshift and
broadening, which are fundamentally distinct from both the gaseous and
solid-state counterparts. Quantitative measurements and simulations of HHG in
liquids illustrate a near linear dependence of harmonic redshift and broadening
on the laser intensity, with the nonlinear response of water exceeding that of
ethanol. The simulations reveal that these features arise from delocalized
electronic states with energy loss in multiple scatterings and transient Stark
shift during their transitions in laser fields. Meanwhile, we find that liquid
polarity or hydrogen bond exerts decisive control over the transition dipole
momentum distributions of delocalized states. Our findings establish a
nonlinear spectral method for probing the internal network in liquids, paving
the way for studying its role in chemical and biological processes.

Abstract: Quantum enhanced sensing exploits the coherent dynamics of two-level systems
(TLSs) to achieve exceptional sensitivities and measurement precision that
surpass classical detection limits. While platforms such as nitrogen vacancy
centers in diamond and rare earth doped crystals have shown excellent
performance, their integration with surfaces and external targets remains
limited by bulk geometries. Two dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials,
particularly hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), offer a compelling alternative,
providing atomically thin hosts for spin defects with intrinsic surface
proximity and environmental accessibility. These attributes enable high
resolution sensing of magnetic fields, strain, and temperature at the
nanoscale. In this Perspective, we review recent progress in quantum sensing
using spin defects in hBN, including the widely studied boron vacancy (VB-) and
emerging carbon related single spin centers. We summarize protocols for spin
initialization, coherent manipulation, and optical readout, and highlight
demonstrated applications in hybrid architectures and extreme environments and
discuss advances in deterministic defect engineering, coherence preservation at
the 2D limit. Finally, we discuss future opportunities and challenges in
realizing scalable, robust, and multifunctional quantum sensors based on 2D
materials.

Abstract: The growing challenges of scaling digital computing motivate new approaches,
especially through the dynamical evolution of physical systems that mimic
neural networks and combinatorial optimization problems. While light is a hyper
efficient information carrier, intrinsically weak light interactions make
direct information processing difficult to implement. Recently, specialized
nonlinear photonics have opened new controls over light fields with
extraordinary bandwidth, coherence, and the emergence of strong interactions
among nonlinear eigenstates like solitons. We harness an ensemble of hundreds
of Kerr-nonlinear microresonator solitons and implement an analog feedback
network to create an Ising machine with fully programmable all-to-all
interactions. By increasing the feedback for self, on-diagonal interactions,
each soliton exhibits a universal spin-like bifurcation. Using this palette of
interactions amongst the entire soliton ensemble, we encode the Ising machine
to solve the benchmark Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). The combination of
uniform soliton interactions and the compatibility of our Ising machine with
high-speed data interconnects enables rapid and precise solutions of complex
SAT problems. Indeed, the soliton properties bound the tradeoff of optical
power and time use by the machine at approximately 10 mW and 1 $\mu$s for a
single feedback step. We performed >10,000 trials on more than 100 randomly
generated SAT instances to evaluate the Ising machine, demonstrating the
potential to exceed the performance of benchmark digital SAT solvers. Our work
highlights the convergence of optical nonlinearity, ultralow loss photonics,
and optoelectronic circuits, which can be combined for a wide range of
computation-acceleration tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be focused on creating advanced magnetic components for use in electron optics.

Method: The method involves using wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) with a flat tool while rotating the workpiece to manufacture high-precision rare-earth helices.

Result: The prototype successfully produced an undulator with a magnetostatic field of 0.53 T and a K-value near unity. Further calculations suggest that similar or larger systems could achieve even higher magnetic fields with appropriate configurations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that this manufacturing method and design of helical undulators are effective for generating powerful magnetic fields suitable for electron beams.

Abstract: An experiment with short prototypes of helical undulators, comprised of
longitudinally magnetized helices made from a single piece of a rare-earth
magnet, is described. Wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) in combination
with a flat tool and the rotary movement of the workpiece made it possible to
achieve high precision in the manufacture of NdFeB helices. An assembly of two
oppositely longitudinally magnetized helices with a period of 20 mm and a
relatively large inner diameter of 8 mm creates a field of 0.53 T on the axis
of the system, which ensures the value of the undulator parameter K close to
unity. According to the calculation, Halbach-type helical micro-undulators with
periods of (3-6) mm of four helices can provide a field of 1 T and K = 0.28-0.6
at the axis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of free-electron lasers into hard X-rays with precise amplitude and phase control is a significant leap forward in enabling new types of experiments in quantum optics and ultrafast applications.

Method: They used a self-seeded FEL driven by an electron beam shaped with a slotted foil and a corrugated wakefield structure; the radiation was measured using ultrafast photon detection and phase-locked to achieve precise control.

Result: They achieved ultrafast (femtosecond) adjustable pulses with high brightness, intensity tunability, and phase control, which are essential for advanced X-ray techniques.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens the door for using ultrafast X-ray pulses in quantum optics, coherent spectroscopy, and other high-precision experiments, marking a milestone towards arbitrary waveform generation in hard X-rays.

Abstract: The ability to arbitrarily dial in amplitudes and phases enables the
fundamental quantum state operations pioneered for microwaves and then infrared
and visible wavelengths during the second half of the last century. Self-seeded
X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) routinely generate coherent, high-brightness,
and ultrafast pulses for a wide range of experiments, but have so far not
achieved a comparable level of amplitude and phase control. Here we report the
first tunable phase-locked, ultra-fast hard X-ray (PHLUX) pulses by
implementing a recently proposed method: A fresh-bunch self-seeded FEL, driven
by an electron beam that was shaped with a slotted foil and a corrugated
wakefield structure, generates coherent radiation that is intensity-modulated
on the femtosecond time scale. We measure phase-locked (to within a
shot-to-shot phase jitter corresponding to 0.1 attoseconds) pulse triplets with
a photon energy of 9.7 keV, a pulse energy of several tens of microjoules, a
freely tunable relative phase, and a pulse delay tunability between 4.5 and
11.9 fs. Such pulse sequences are suitable for a wide range of applications,
including coherent spectroscopy, and have amplitudes sufficient to enable hard
X-ray quantum optics experiments. More generally, these results represent an
important step towards a hard X-ray arbitrary waveform generator.

Abstract: A robust and flexible architecture capable of providing real-time analysis on

experiments. In this paper, we present such an online framework, used in June
2025 as part of the HRMT-68 experiment, performed at the HiRadMat facility at
CERN, using the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam line. HRMT-68 was a
fixed-target laboratory astrophysics experiment aiming to identify plasma
instabilities generated by a relativistic electron-positron beam during
traversal of an argon plasma. This framework was essential for experimental
data acquisition and analysis, and can be adapted for a broad range of
experiments with a variety of experimental diagnostics. The framework's modular
and customizable design enabled us to rapidly observe and extract emergent
features from a diverse range of diagnostic data. Simultaneously, it allowed
for both the introduction of new diagnostic devices and the modification of our
analysis as features of interest were identified. As a result, we were able to
effectively diagnose equipment malfunction, and infer the beam's response to
varying bunch duration, beam intensity, and the plasma state without resorting
to offline analysis, at which time adjustment or improvement would have been
impossible. We present the features of this agile framework, whose codebase we
have made publicly available, which can be adapted for future experiments with
minimal modification.

Abstract: Recent years have seen the first production of "post-adiabatic"
gravitational-waveform models based on second-order gravitational self-force
theory. These models rely on calculations of an effective source in the
perturbative second-order Einstein equation. Here, for the first time, we
detail the calculation of the effective source in a Schwarzschild background,
which underlies the second-order self-force results in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127,
151102 (2021); ibid. 128, 231101 (2022); ibid. 130, 241402 (2023)]. The source
is designed for use in the multiscale form of the Lorenz-gauge Einstein
equation, decomposed in tensor spherical harmonics, or in the analogous
second-order Teukolsky equation. It involves, among other things, contributions
from (i) quadratic coupling of first-order field modes, (ii) the slow evolution
of first-order fields, (iii) quadratic products of a first-order puncture
field, and (iv) the second-order puncture field. We validate each of these

TL;DR: The study measures eccentricities in six low-mass GW events using new and existing models, finding support for non-negligible eccentricity in two events and model dependency with prior assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding eccentricity in gravitational waves helps distinguish formation channels, such as mergers versus other processes. This study aims to quantify it accurately.

Method: Waveform models SEOBNRv5EHM and TEOBResumS-Dali were used. Bayesian inferences with marginalization and parallelization were optimized. Events analyzed: GW200105, GW190814, and others.

Result: For two events, non-negligible eccentricity is found. Bayes factor supports the eccentric model; some cases show significant support, others less.

Conclusion: Eccentricity in low-mass binaries is measurable, but models and priors significantly affect conclusions. More data needed to resolve discrepancies among models and further observations are suggested.

Abstract: Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational
waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting
eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate
eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian
inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass
gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four
observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using
the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the
existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity
constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in
both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and
parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible
eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20
Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for
SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides
moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of
$\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on
eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources
are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$
to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in
GW190814.

TL;DR: The paper investigates black hole thermodynamics in Conformal Weyl Gravity using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, finding quantum corrections and phase transitions that differ from Schwarzschild black holes. They use tunneling formalism and GUP to derive Hawking temperature and entropy, and the results suggest possible observable signatures in gravitational redshift and cooling/heating effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about black hole thermodynamics, aiming to explore beyond general relativity, using conformal gravity and quantum corrections.

Method: The authors employ the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism, Generalized Uncertainty Principle, and entropy models to calculate thermodynamic quantities and analyze phase transitions.

Result: The results reveal significant quantum corrections and phase transitions in black hole thermodynamics, with potential observational consequences.

Conclusion: Conformal Weyl Gravity provides a viable framework for studying black hole thermodynamics with quantum effects and phase structures that differ from Schwarzschild solutions.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in Conformal Weyl
Gravity (CWG) using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, with particular emphasis on
quantum corrections that become significant near the Planck scale. Our analysis
employs the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism to derive the Hawking
temperature, revealing explicit contributions from the conformal parameters
$\beta$, $\gamma$, and $k$ that lead to substantial deviations from
Schwarzschild black hole behavior. We incorporate quantum gravitational effects
through the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, demonstrating systematic
suppression of thermal radiation in the near-Planckian regime. Using an
exponentially corrected entropy model, we compute the complete spectrum of QC
thermodynamic potentials, including internal energy, pressure, heat capacity,
and free energies. Our heat capacity analysis reveals critical phase
transitions separating thermodynamically stable and unstable regions, with the
scale-dependent parameter $\gamma$ playing a crucial role in controlling phase
structure. The Joule-Thomson expansion analysis shows distinct cooling and
heating regimes with inversion points that shift systematically with CWG
parameters, capturing QC phase transitions absent in general relativity. We
also examine gravitational redshift in CWG geometry, finding complex radial
dependence that could provide observable signatures for distinguishing
conformal gravity from Einstein's theory. Our results demonstrate that CWG
offers a consistent framework for studying black hole thermodynamics beyond
general relativity, with quantum corrections revealing rich phase structures
and potential observational consequences.

*Yu Tang,Wentao Liu,Zhilong Liu,Jieci Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates entanglement and mutual information harvesting by two Unruh-DeWitt detectors in BTZ black hole spacetimes with mass superposition. The superposed spacetime enhances entanglement harvesting compared to single spacetime backgrounds. Mutual information is influenced by the proper distance between detectors, and while it's lower for small distances, it surpasses single spacetime cases at higher distances for specific mass ratios. Both measures peak when the spacetime aligns with initial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores quantum phenomena in spacetime superposition, which is significant for understanding quantum gravity and information transmission in extreme environments.

Method: The researchers likely employed theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and possibly quantum information theory tools to calculate entanglement and mutual information under varying mass ratios and distances.

Result: Superposition spacetime significantly enhances entanglement harvesting. Mutual information's behavior depends on detector proximity, with higher values possible at larger distances for specific mass ratios. Peaks in both metrics occur when the final state aligns with the initial spacetime.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into enhancing quantum information harvesting by exploiting spacetime superposition, with implications for quantum communication and gravity studies.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore correlation harvesting in quantum superposition,
specifically focusing on the entanglement and mutual information extracted by
two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in a
mass-superposed BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that the
superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can
significantly enhance the entanglement harvesting relative to a single
spacetime background. In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information
obtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance
between the two detectors. While the mutual information harvested in a
superposed spacetime remains lower than that in a single spacetime when the
proper distance between detectors is small, it exceeds that in a single
spacetime for specific mass ratios as the distance increases. Notably, we find
that both entanglement and mutual information harvesting reach their maxima
when the final spacetime superposition state is conditioned to align with the
initial spacetime state.

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals
(EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into
strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex,
non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental
noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local
optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical
bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a
pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows
(CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly
explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior
sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering
EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference,
FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would
serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.

Motivation: 探索加速环境中量子纠缠的特性及其在 Hawking 辐射中的应用。

Result: 边界加速增大导致低能粒子主导纠缠，高能粒子贡献降低。

Conclusion: 加速系统作为压缩装置，有效性与粒子能量有关。需要全面描述量子纠缠结构，仅用两体分析不足。

Abstract: This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a
one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a
setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum
correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$
is a given mode and subsystem $B$ the rest of the system. For initial pure
states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the
Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Besides the
initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed
states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated.
Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis
is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond
the validity of our numerical algorithms. Our findings reveal that the
expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner
pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. A significant conclusion is
that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a
low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to
the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the
boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases towards the ultraviolet modes,
indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and
hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. While the
Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula offers notable computational efficiency,
partner modes do not commute, due to the non-trivial multimode entanglement
structure of the system. Hence, this pairwise description is not suitable for
describing the full system.

Finally, the paper underscores the importance of sensitivity in GW detectors and the statistical methods required to analyze large volumes of data efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper discusses advanced gravitational wave detection techniques and their application in astrophysical environments, specifically focusing on dynamical capture events of black holes. It seems relevant because gravitational waves offer a unique way to study extreme astrophysical phenomena, so understanding their detection methods is crucial for both astrophysics and potential futureSpace exploration applications. The use of Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) in signal processing is innovative and could improve the accuracy of GW event detection. Additionally, the paper presents significant findings regarding detection limits and event rates, which can help refine theoretical models of stellar dynamics and black hole interactions. Furthermore, the paper's mention of the detection of GW190521 adds to its relevance, as real detections validate the methods and theories discussed. Overall, this paper bridges theoretical astrophysics with practical detection techniques, making it an important contribution to the field of gravitational wave astronomy.

Method: The paper uses gravitational wave detection techniques enhanced with Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) to search for dynamical black hole capture events. The methodology involves the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm run during the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing campaign. Two approaches are employed with GMM: a weakly-modeled approach that searches for generic short transients with minimal assumptions, and a population-informed approach that utilizes information about the parameter space of the capture population. The search leads to no significant new GW events, but improved sensitivity is achieved through the GMM approach. The paper also employs the confident detection of GW190521 to refine event rate estimates, using Bayesian inference and bootstrap resampling techniques.

Result: The study finds that the informed GMM approach enhances detection sensitivity, enabling the detection of dynamical capture events up to 1.9 Gpc for a 200 solar mass binary. Upper limit estimates for event rates at 90% confidence are provided, with the most stringent being 0.15 Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}. Additionally, the weakly-modeled GMM approach can detect events up to 1 Gpc under minimal assumptions. The confident detection of GW190521 improves rate estimates, with an assumed event origin from dynamical capture resulting in a rate of approximately 0.94 Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}. These results highlight the effectiveness of GMM in detecting GW events and expanding the range of observable events. The findings contribute to refining theoretical models of black hole interactions and stellar dynamics, offering new insights into the location and frequency of such events in the universe.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the successful application of Gaussian mixture modeling to detect gravitational waves from black hole capture events in dense astrophysical environments. By enhancing the cWB algorithm with GMM, the study achieves improved sensitivity, enabling the detection of such events at longer distances. The updated rate estimates provide critical constraints on the theoretical models of stellar dynamics and black hole evolution. Additionally, the confident detection of GW190521 supports the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, highlighting the potential of gravitational wave astronomy to advance our understanding of extreme astrophysical phenomena. The findings support the continued development of advanced detection techniques and statistical methods necessary for interpreting large volumes of gravitational wave data, making this work a valuable contribution to the field of gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to originate from black holes
interacting dynamically in dense astrophysical environments. In such
environments, given that the velocity and cross section between the interacting
black holes is low, dynamical capture may occur. Such events merge on very
short timescales with high eccentricities and are expected to be detectable in
the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. In this work, we present a
dedicated search for dynamical black hole capture events in the third LVK
observing run with the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm enhanced with
Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) post-production. With this we consider two
applications of GMM: a weakly-modeled approach searching for generic short
transients under minimal assumptions, and a population informed approach, in
which the GMM model is provided information on the parameter space occupied by
the capture population. Although our search does not find any new significant
GW events, we find that an informed GMM approach brings significant sensitivity
improvements, enabling the detection of dynamical capture events up to a
distance of 1.9 Gpc for a 200 $M_{\odot}$ equal mass binary. We present updated
upper limit estimates of the rate at 90\% confidence, the most stringent of
which is 0.15 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, a 34\% improvement with respect to previous
observational estimates. Furthermore, while the weakly-modeled GMM approach is
less sensitive to dynamical capture systems, we find that it is possible for
these events to be detected up to a distance of 1 Gpc in the cWB-GMM all-sky
short search under minimal assumptions. Finally, with the confident detection
of GW190521, we estimate the rate of similar events to be 0.94
Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, assuming the event originated from a dynamical capture.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper finds that Brans-Dicke gravity doesn't always approach General Relativity at ω→∞ due to a non-zero chemical potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing limits of Brans-Dicke gravity's applicability to general relativity is important for understanding gravitational theories beyond standard models.

Method: Uses thermodynamics of scalar-tensor gravity, focusing on the Einstein frame and the role of chemical potential in the limit.

Result: Demonstrates Brans-Dicke doesn't reduce to GR because of non-vanishing chemical potential.

Conclusion: Implications for alternative gravity theories and their thermodynamic consistency are discussed.

Abstract: Brans-Dicke gravity does not always reduce to General Relativity in the limit
$\omega\to\infty$ for the coupling constant. This anomalous behavior is
examined within the formalism of the first-order thermodynamics of
scalar-tensor gravity. It is shown that this effect is linked to the
non-vanishing nature of the chemical potential, in the Einstein frame
formulation of the thermodynamic analogy, in the $\omega\to\infty$ limit.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses how scalar charges and orbital parameters affect gravitational wave signals from EMRIs. It finds that inclination enhances detectability of scalar effects and suggests EMRIs with generic orbits as a good target for studying new physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's abstract provides insights into gravitational waves from black hole binaries, which are important for testing general relativity and discovering new physics.

Method: Numerical computations were used to analyze the impact of scalar charge, eccentricity, and inclination on EMRI signals.

Result: Including inclination improves the detection of scalar effects, and the effects are more noticeable with eccentric orbits.

Conclusion: EMRIs with eccentricity and inclination provide a rich signal for studying deviations from GR and fundamental fields, making them a promising target for future gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to
provide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of
black hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in
which a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black
hole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the
strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general
relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar
fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the
inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that
present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters
affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave
signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in
particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing
richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic
case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides
a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs
with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently
constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational
wave observations.

### [41] [Rigidity aspects of a cosmological singularity theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00524)
*Eric Ling,Carl Rossdeutscher,Walter Simon,Roland Steinbauer*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper relaxes convexity conditions in singularity theorems, applicable in general relativity. It introduces two new theorems that provide different scenarios, one involving surface bundles and another involving isometry groups, which give more specific information about spacetime foliations. Additionally, the paper considers cases like non-orientable or Haken manifolds, offering stronger conclusions for these cases without needing covers. They also provide examples using Λ-vacuum solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds on singularity theorems from general relativity, aiming to relax certain conditions to apply to broader scenarios. The authors explore the implications of modified convexity conditions on the structure of spacetime, providing new insights into the incompleteness of spacetime or the possibility of spacetime having specific bundle structures. They also consider cases involving isometry groups, which allow for more detailed conclusions about spacetime foliations in certain cases.

Method: The authors use advanced differential geometry techniques, specifically focusing on Cauchy surfaces, their extrinsic curvature properties (convexity conditions), and the effects of isometry groups on these properties. The proof likely involves analyzing geodesic incompleteness under modified convexity conditions and the decomposition of curvature tensors in the presence of symmetries introduced by isometries.

Result: Under relaxed convexity conditions, the paper identifies two distinct scenarios: one where spacetime is presented as a surface bundle over the circle, and another where additional considerations of isometry groups lead to specific foliations or topological conclusions about the spacetime. In certain special cases, such as non-orientable or Haken manifolds, the conclusions are even stronger, without the need for covering spaces.

Conclusion: The results contribute to the understanding of when and how spacetime can be singular or geodesically incomplete under weaker conditions than previously required. By considering additional structures, such as isometry groups and specific topological properties, the paper broadens the applicability of singularity theorems to more complex spacetime models. The inclusion of Λ-vacuum solutions provides concrete examples, demonstrating the practical relevance of the theorems for constructing valid spacetime models in general relativity.

Abstract: Inspired by the classical singularity theorems in General Relativity,
Galloway and Ling have shown the following (cf. Theorem 0): If a globally
hyperbolic spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a closed,
spacelike Cauchy surface $(V,g,K)$ (with metric $g$ and extrinsic curvature
${K}$) which is strictly 2-convex (meaning that the sum of the lowest two
eigenvalues of $K$ is positive) then $V$ is either a spherical space or past
null geodesically incomplete \cite{Ling, Ling2}. In the present work we relax
the convexity condition in two respects. Firstly (cf. Theorem 1) we admit
$2$-convex extrinsic curvatures, (for which the sum of the lowest two
eigenvalues is non-negative) which allows for the following further
possibility: Either $V$ or some finite cover $\tilde V$ are surface bundles
over the circle, with totally geodesic fibers. Secondly, (cf. Theorem 2) if
$(V,g,{K})$ admits a $U(1)$ isometry group with corresponding Killing vector
$\xi$, we can further relax the convexity requirement in terms of the
decomposition of ${K}$ with respect to the directions parallel and orthogonal
to $\xi$. Compared to Theorem 1, this yields more specific information on the
possible foliations of $V$, depending on whether the isometry is tangent to the
base or to the fibers. Moreover, in the special cases that $V$ is either
non-orientable, or non-prime, or an orientable Haken manifold with vanishing
second homology, we obtain stronger statements in both Theorems without passing
to covers. While our results do not use Einstein's equations, we provide
several classes of $\Lambda$-vacuum solutions of these equations as examples.

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are usually surrounded by an accretion disk. At
least parts of these accretion disks consist of a plasma in which light rays
with different energies are dispersed. However, we usually do not know the
exact configurations of these plasmas. In this paper we will now use the
example of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in an inhomogeneous pressureless
and nonmagnetised plasma to investigate how the structural changes of the
photon rings can help us to determine the properties of a plasma surrounding a
black hole using multifrequency observations. For this purpose we will use a
simple analytic model which describes a plasma whose electron density increases
towards the equatorial plane when we approach the event horizon. For the chosen
model we will first derive and then analytically solve the equations of motion.
Then we will place an observer in the domain of outer communication and
introduce an orthonormal tetrad to relate the constants of motion to
latitude-longitude coordinates on the observer's celestial sphere. In the next
step we will use the analytic solutions to investigate the geometric structures
of the direct image as well as the photon rings of first and second order on
the observer's celestial sphere. We will write down a lens equation and
calculate the redshift and the travel time. We will compare the obtained
results to results for photon rings in vacuum and in the presence of a
homogeneous plasma. Finally, we will discuss which of these quantities can be
used to extract information about the properties of the plasma.

Motivation: 作者希望探索一个新方向，通过引入矢量场来寻找更光滑、更稳定的黑洞解。

Method: 论文从四维作用原理出发，结合度量和矢量场，推导出正则黑洞解。使用了拉格朗日密度来构建作用量，并通过求解方程得到了特定的度量形式，Hayward度量作为例子。然后通过调整自由积分常数来调节质量，并计算了这些度量的表面引力，发现它们可以成为极端黑洞。此外，还提出了一种新的正则度量，作为引力星解。

Result: 他们构造的正则黑洞解能够避免除非线性项的干扰而产生质量增生不稳定性。当选择特定积分常数时，可以得到极端黑洞，甚至还能形成引力星。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了引入矢量场作为额外的自由度，可能为黑洞的稳定性问题提供新的解决方案。未来可以进一步研究这些解的热力学性质和稳定性。

Abstract: We derive regular black-hole solutions, including the Hayward metric, from
four-dimensional action principles involving vector fields in addition to the
metric. These black holes possess additional hair associated with the vector
fields, manifesting as free integration constants that regularize the geometry.
These constants can be chosen such that regular black holes of all masses are
extremal. As a result, they have vanishing surface gravity and are not
susceptible to mass-inflation instability. We also discover another regular
black-hole metric with these properties, which constitutes a gravastar for an
appropriate choice of integration constant.

Abstract: We investigate the geometric and physical properties of an anti-de Sitter
(AdS) black hole space-time coupled by a cloud of strings and surrounded by a
quintessence-like fluid, all within the framework of non-commutative (NC)
geometry. From the perspective of geometrical optics, we analyze the behavior
of null geodesics, focusing on key optical features such as the effective
potential, the structure and radius of the photon sphere, light deflection
angles, photon trajectories, and the resulting black hole (BH) shadow. Our
findings show that the combined effects of the string cloud and
quintessence-like fluid significantly modify photon dynamics and optical
observables, leading to notable deviations from standard BH scenarios in NC
geometry background. We also examine time-like geodesics, with particular
emphasis on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). The results
demonstrate that the presence of geometric matter components alters the ISCO
radius compared to conventional solutions. In addition, we explore the
thermodynamic behavior of the BH, deriving expressions for the Hawking
temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. The
influence of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid introduces
substantial modifications to the thermodynamic profile, including shifts in
phase transition points and changes to stability conditions under NC geometric
effects. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of massless scalar field
perturbations in this modified background by formulating the Klein-Gordon
equation and reducing it to a Schr\"odinger-like form via separation of
variables. The resulting effective potential is analyzed in detail,
highlighting the significant role of both the string cloud and the
quintessence-like fluid in shaping the perturbative landscape within the NC
geometry setting.

Abstract: While aquaporin (AQP) gating dynamically regulates transmembrane water
permeability for cellular homeostasis, its mechanisms remain poorly understood
compared to ion channels. A central challenge is the lack of methods to measure
water flow through AQPs with the spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity
equivalent to patch-clamp recordings of ion fluxes, a limitation stemming from
the electrically silent nature of water transport. We introduce a technique to
rapidly detect cytoplasmic flows induced by osmotic-gradient-driven
transmembrane water transport in single adherent human cancer cells. This
approach enables direct measurement of AQP-mediated water transport and
provides a powerful tool to investigate AQP function and regulation and
cytoplasmic flow dynamics at the single-cell level.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯策略在维护社会合作方面具有优势。

Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively
complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential
strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices
to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas.
Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their
ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate
whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when
actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs
by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the
change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions.
By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a
resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under
which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive
strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large
class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation
leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of
success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool
and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.

trilayer at $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\nu_{3}= \frac13$, tuned solely by the inter-layer
spacing $d$, realizes this goal. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) calculations and a Chern-Simons field theory analysis reveal an
intermediate ``anyon-exciton condensate'' separating the familiar
$\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=1$ exciton condensate ($d \to 0$) from three decoupled
Laughlin liquids ($d \to \infty$). In this phase, neutral bi-excitons condense
while a $\nu=\frac23$ Laughlin topological order survives, yielding a Goldstone
mode coexisting with fractionalized anyons. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis maps out
the finite-temperature phase diagram. The anyon-exciton condensate can be
experimentally verified through a vanishing double-counter-flow resistance and
a fractional layer-resolved Hall resistivity $R_{xy}=\frac{5}{2} h/e^{2}$, both
within reach of existing high-mobility trilayer devices.

Conclusion: 强调量子计算工具在提升 Many-Body 处理中的作用。

Abstract: Near-term quantum processors are limited in terms of the number of qubits and
gates they can afford. They nevertheless give unprecedented access to
programmable quantum systems that can efficiently, although imperfectly,
simulate quantum time evolutions. Dynamical mean field theory, on the other
hand, maps strongly-correlated lattice models like the Hubbard model onto
simpler, yet still many-body models called impurity models. Its computational
bottleneck boils down to investigating the dynamics of the impurity upon
addition or removal of one particle. This task is notoriously difficult for
classical algorithms, which has warranted the development of specific classical
algorithms called "impurity solvers" that work well in some regimes, but still
struggle to reach some parameter regimes. In these lecture notes, we introduce
the tools and methods of quantum computing that could be used to overcome the
limitations of these classical impurity solvers, either in the long term --
with fully quantum algorithms, or in the short term -- with hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms.

Conclusion: middle-infrared radiation can induce phase transitions in strongly correlated systems, and high-harmonic spectroscopy is a valuable tool for研究 these dynamics。

Abstract: Solids in an intense laser field show high-harmonic generation (HHG), which
can provide information on carrier dynamics and band structures in weakly
correlated systems. In strongly correlated systems, a laser field can induce a
transition between the various electronic phases formed by the entanglement of
charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom via carrier generation. The HHG
accompanying this process should contain information on the nonequilibrium
electronic-state dynamics along the oscillating field - an aspect that remains
unresolved to date. Here, we show that an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse
induces a Mott insulator-metal transition in a one-dimensional cuprate,
Sr2CuO3, the evolution of which is reflected by the spectral features of HHs.
When the electric-field amplitude exceeds 6 MV/cm, carriers are efficiently
generated and each harmonic frequency decreases from odd multiples of the MIR
frequency. Dynamical mean-field theory indicates that these redshifts originate
from a series of electronic-structure reconstructions in each electric-field
cycle during the melting of the Mott-insulator state, which modifies the
radiation phase from carrier recombination cycle-by-cycle. This phenomenon is
negligible in rigid-band systems. This experimental-theoretical study confirms
that HH spectroscopy research can potentially unravel the sub-cycle dynamics of
nonequilibrium phase transitions in correlated materials.

Abstract: Quantum geometry, which describes the geometry of Bloch wavefunctions in
solids, has become a cornerstone of modern quantum condensed matter physics.
The quantum geometrical tensor encodes this geometry through two fundamental
components: the quantum metric (real part) and the Berry curvature (imaginary
part). While the Berry curvature gained prominence through its manifestation in
the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, recent advances have revealed equally
significant effects arising from the quantum metric. This includes its
signatures in nonlinear transport, superfluid density of flat-band
superconductors, and nonlinear optical responses. These advances underscore how
quantum geometry is reshaping our understanding of condensed matter systems,
with far-reaching implications for future technologies. In this review, we
survey recent progress in the field, focusing on both foundational concepts and
emergent phenomena in transport and optics-with particular emphasis on the
pivotal role of the quantum metric.

Abstract: We have investigated the vanadium-based Kagome metal YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ using
density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Wannier function analysis. We
explore the electronic properties, de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect and Fermi
surface. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling SOC induces the splitting of
Yb-4f states, while its impact on the V-3d states is moderate. Furthermore, we
have incorporated SOC+U, where U being the Hubbard parameter, which drastically
changes the Yb-4f states creating additional splitting leading to three
distinct peaks in the density of states (DOS). The V-3d atoms with the Kagome
lattice contribute maximum to the transport properties, exhibits flat bands
near the EF while being protected under SOC and U+SOC. Herein, we report the
vulnerability of the Yb-4f states under SOC and U+SOC. Furthurmore, The Fermi
surface is found to comprise of quasi-2D cylindrical sheets centered at the
Gamma-point, along with smaller pockets near the Brillouin zone boundaries,
which under combined U+SOC, a small spherical pocket emerges and the
cylindrical sheet exhibits slight deformations. The dHvA frequencies reach as
high as 70 kilotesla, which increase with tilt angle, exhibiting a nearly
parabolic trend as expected for cylindrical orbits, while a low-frequency
branch remains below 1 kT. Only the U+SOC case shows noticeable modification in
both the Fermi surface and the dHvA oscillation. Crucially, the $Z_2$ invariant
calculation identifies YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ as a strong topological metal ($r_0 = 1$).
These findings not only advance our understanding of the underlying quantum
phenomena in rare-earth Kagome systems, but also establish YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ as a
compelling and promising platform for exploring intertwined topology and
electron correlations in kagome lattices, thereby offering valuable insights
for engineering quantum phases in layered materials.

Abstract: We study an out-of-equilibrium quantum system in which a state connecting two
reservoirs is also coupled by stimulated and spontaneous emission of photons to
an antitrapped state, thus implementing particle loss. After revisiting the
spontaneous emission process, we show that the proper effective description of
such a system requires one to go beyond the usual Lindbladian formalism and
includes a nonreciprocal (``non-Hermitian'') coupling to the reservoir modeling
the untrapped state. The presence of both, the reservoirs and the nonreciprocal
coupling, have observable consequences that we compute, for example, by looking
at the quantum Zeno effect in the loss current. We discuss the connection of
our findings to possible experiments in cold atomic gases.

### [54] [Weak Values as Geometric Lenses: Deformations of Hilbert Space and the Emergence of superoscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00023)
*Mirco A. Mannucci*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Summary: The paper explores superoscillations through the lens of weak measurement in quantum mechanics. It presents a geometric framework where superoscillations emerge from Hilbert space structure deformations, showing they are natural consequences of weak values. The key insight is linking superoscillations to weak values as ratios of geometric deformations, framed within projective geometry. This unifies weak measurements and superoscillations as aspects of the same geometric principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Why I'm interested: The ability of quantum systems to exhibit superoscillations seems counterintuitive, but this paper uses foundational quantum mechanics to explain their existence. As someone interested in quantum phenomena, understanding the underlying principles reinforces my grasp of quantum theory.

Method: The paper starts by introducing weak measurement formalism, then defines superoscillations, and constructs a geometric framework without direct pointers. It interprets weak values as deformation ratios, linking them to projective geometry and generalized Rayleigh quotients, finally integrating these into a unified geometric perspective on weak measurements and superoscillations.

Result: The result extends our understanding of quantum mechanics by linking superoscillations to geometric structure, provides a deeper insight into weak values, and shows that superoscillations are natural consequences of deformation mechanisms in Hilbert space.

Conclusion: The conclusion significantly enhances our understanding of quantum phenomena by framing superoscillations as natural outcomes of geometric structure, linking weak values to arithmetic and geometric principles, demonstrating that no explicit pointer states are necessary for their emergence, and integrating these into a unified geometric perspective on quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The formalism of weak measurement in quantum mechanics has revealed profound
connections between measurement theory, quantum foundations, and signal
processing. In this paper, we develop a pointer-free derivation of
superoscillations, demonstrating that they are a natural and necessary
consequence of the geometric structure underlying weak values. We argue that
the weak value is best understood as a ratio of geometric deformation,
quantifying how an observable transforms the structure of Hilbert space
relative to a reference provided by the standard inner product. This
deformation acts as a conceptual lens, warping the local structure of quantum
states to produce oscillations far exceeding the global Fourier bandwidth. We
formalize this by interpreting the weak value as a comparison between a
deformed sesquilinear form and the standard one, and explore its deep
connections to generalized Rayleigh quotients and the projective geometry of
quantum states. This perspective unifies weak values and superoscillations as
two facets of a single underlying geometric principle.

TL;DR: Quantum Support Vector Machines have scalability issues from high-dimensional states and hardware. We propose an embedding-aware pipeline using class-balanced k-means distillation and Vision Transformer embeddings. The key finding is that ViT embeddings improve accuracy by 8.02% and 4.42% on Fashion-MNIST and MNIST respectively compared to classical SVMs. CNN features do not perform as well. The use of cuTensorNet simulation shows that quantum kernel advantage depends on the embedding choice, highlighting the synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces, offering a scalable pathway for quantum machine learning.

Result: The result shows significant accuracy improvements of 8.02% and 4.42% on Fashion-MNIST and MNIST respectively. Additionally, CNN features did not show improvement over classical SVMs. The simulation using cuTensorNet revealed that transformer attention-based embeddings contribute to quantum kernel advantage, demonstrating a fundamental synergy between quantum feature spaces and neural architectures.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of the embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline in enhancing quantum machine learning performance and the importance of considering embedding choices for quantum kernel efficiency. It emphasizes the potential for scalable quantum machine learning by integrating modern neural architectures and quantum computing resources.

Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to

ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02%
accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST,
while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network

This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that
leverages modern neural architectures.

Result: 研究发现，RMPU在局部可观测下可以高效地模拟Haar分布中的自由度，但平均OTOC行为并不能完全由随机性模拟解释，这表明平均可达性需要更复杂的量子关联。对于无迹局部可观测，RMPU需要较高的算子纠缠度，超出了随机性模拟的能力。

Abstract: Understanding how complex quantum systems emulate randomness is central to
quantum chaos, thermalization, and information theory. In one setting,
out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe
asymptotic freeness between Heisenberg operators: the non-commutative
generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct research direction,
the concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions
of unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging
these two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a
random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only
polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of
higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the
observables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems
according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble
provably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for
average OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further
compute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing
convergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that
freeness is also reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand,
to reproduce the Haar-like OTOC value for local, traceless observables, the
considered ensemble requires volume-law operator entanglement. Such
correlations therefore lie beyond the paradigm of random unitary features which
can be replicated efficiently. Our results highlight the need to refine
previous notions of unitary designs in the context of operator dynamics,
guiding us towards protocols for genuine quantum advantage while shedding light
on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.

### [57] [Beyond asymptotic reasoning: a practical ground state projector based on the wall-Chebyshev expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00533)
*Maria-Andreea Filip,Nathan Fitzpatrick*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We present a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation using a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function, implemented via a projector made from a product of Hamiltonian operators. This method uses the linear combinations of unitaries technique and shows superior performance, especially robustness, compared to existing methods in scenarios with inaccurate energy estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to propose a new quantum algorithm for preparing ground states, which is a fundamental problem in quantum computing. The approach uses Chebyshev series, a method known for its efficiency in function approximation. This could be relevant for solving problems in chemistry or materials science where ground state energies are critical.

Method: The algorithm uses Chebyshev polynomials to approximate the wall function. The projector is constructed as a product of Hamiltonian operators, allowing implementation via linear combinations of unitaries. The method involves analyzing the asymptotic scaling and providing numerical simulations to validate performance against existing techniques.

Result: The paper reports that the Chebyshev-based projector outperforms other leading methods in ground-state preparation, particularly in scenarios where energy estimates are imprecise. The method shows competitive performance and robustness.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their proposed algorithm is a promising approach for preparing ground states with robust performance, especially when accurate initial estimates are lacking, making it suitable for real-world applications in chemistry and beyond.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a
Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. This projector can be
efficiently implemented as a product of Hamiltonian operators, enabling a
straightforward realization via the linear combinations of unitaries method. We
analyze the asymptotic scaling and provide numerical benchmarks, demonstrating
that the wall-Chebyshev projector achieves competitive performance with leading
methods based on imaginary time evolution and alternative projector function
approximations. Notably, our approach exhibits superior robustness and
convergence in scenarios where accurate ground-state energy estimates are
unavailable, showing promise for realistic chemistry problems.

Motivation: 研究者推测弱相互作用量子系统中准粒子的寿命变化可能被对数无关因素显著影响，提出了两种不同的计算方法以揭示具体影响。

Method: 研究者结合了Doe方法和非微扰图论重排，利用数值模拟和理论分析来预测准粒子的寿命变化。

Result: 研究结果表明准粒子的寿命倒数与相互作用强度的平方呈对数增强关系，这与之前的FGR预测不同。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的理解方式，解释了准粒子寿命在不同相互作用强度下的保真情况。这项发现对量子材料和强关联系统的研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: In interacting quantum systems, the single-particle Green's function is
expected to decay in time due to the interaction induced decoherence of
quasiparticles. In the limit of weak interaction strengths ($\Delta$), a naive
application of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) predicts an $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{2})$
quasiparticle decay rate. However, for 1d fermions on the lattice at $T>0$,
this calculation gives a divergent result and the scaling of the quasiparticle
lifetime with interaction strength remains an open question. In this work we
propose a solution to this question: combining numerical simulations using the
recently introduced dissipation-assisted operator evolution (DAOE) method, with
non-perturbative diagrammatic re-summations, we predict a logarithmic
enhancement of the quasiparticle decay rate $\tau^{-1} \sim \Delta^{2} \log
\Delta^{-2}$. We argue that this effect is present in a wide variety of
well-known weakly interacting quantum fermionic and bosonic systems, and even
in some classical systems, provided the non-interacting limit has
quasiparticles with a generic dispersion.

Conclusion: 所述方法适用于不同层的组合以及有限温度，展示了在不同结构下有效计算范德华力的能力。

Abstract: The Van Kampen method is used to calculate the Casimir force for two
dielectric layers. Several terms of Lorentz oscillators are used in the
permittivity model. A conductive dielectric (metal) with the Drude model is
considered as a special case. The dependence of strength on thickness has a
complex character with saturation at thicknesses of the order of 10 nm. At low
thickness, the force density is proportional to the square of the thickness,
but this is the case at low thicknesses, when the continuum model is no longer
applicable. The correspondence between the method of the Casimir model and the
Lorentz model is shown, as well as its applicability for an arbitrary
configuration of layers and for a finite temperature.

Abstract: Modern recommenders describe each item with hundreds of sparse semantic tags,
yet most quantum pipelines still map one qubit per tag, demanding well beyond
one hundred qubits, far out of reach for current noisy-intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices and prone to deep, error-amplifying circuits. We close
this gap with a three-stage hybrid machine learning algorithm that compresses
tag profiles, optimizes feature selection under a fixed qubit budget via QAOA,
and scores recommendations with a Quantum semi-Random Forest (QsRF) built on
just five qubits, while performing similarly to the state-of-the-art methods.
Leveraging SVD sketching and k-means, we learn a 1000-atom dictionary ($>$97 \%
variance), then solve a 2020 QUBO via depth-3 QAOA to select 5 atoms. A
100-tree QsRF trained on these codes matches full-feature baselines on

Abstract: Large-scale civil structures, such as bridges, pipelines, and offshore
platforms, are vital to modern infrastructure, where unexpected failures can
cause significant economic and safety repercussions. Although finite element
(FE) modeling is widely used for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM),
its high computational cost and the complexity of inverse FE analysis, where
low dimensional sensor data must map onto high-dimensional displacement or
stress fields pose ongoing challenges. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum
classical multilayer perceptron (QMLP) framework to tackle these issues and
facilitate swift updates to digital twins across a range of structural
applications.
  Our approach embeds sensor data using symmetric positive definite (SPD)
matrices and polynomial features, yielding a representation well suited to
quantum processing. A parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) transforms these
features, and the resultant quantum outputs feed into a classical neural
network for final inference. By fusing quantum capabilities with classical
modeling, the QMLP handles large scale inverse FE mapping while preserving
computational viability.
  Through extensive experiments on a bridge, we demonstrate that the QMLP
achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0000000000316, outperforming purely
classical baselines with a large margin. These findings confirm the potential
of quantum-enhanced methods for real time SHM, establishing a pathway toward
more efficient, scalable digital twins that can robustly monitor and diagnose
structural integrity in near real time.

Abstract: Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular
value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear
combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively
applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector
expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$
principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore,
writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of
the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based
denoising.
  In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$
(determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the
training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire
datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network
head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the
quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional
probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and
potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training
large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module
for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to
compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the
classical processing component.

### [63] [Learning shadows to predict quantum ground state correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00052)
*Pierre-Gabriel Rozon,Kartiek Agarwal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A variational method inspired by shadow tomography is introduced to compute ground state correlations of spin Hamiltonians, using efficient snapshots for representation and optimization to lower energy.  Operations can be parallelized, simulations are efficient, and a more complete ground state description is achieved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper presents a novel approach combining variational methods with quantum state tomography to efficiently compute ground state properties. It leverages the efficiency of shadow tomography to reduce the number of measurements needed while maintaining accuracy, making it suitable for simulating complex quantum systems.

Method: The authors employ a variational scheme using a bag of snapshots derived from shadow tomography. These snapshots are used to represent the ground state of a spin Hamiltonian, optimized to minimize energy while incorporating constraints based on the positivity of reduced density matrices inspired by quantum chemistry.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that the method can be efficiently parallelized, simulations are computationally feasible, and it provides a comprehensive description of the ground state correlations.

Conclusion: The introduced variational method offers an efficient and scalable approach for computing ground state properties of quantum spin systems, leveraging the efficiency of shadow tomography and incorporating quantum state constraints to improve the accuracy and completeness of the results.

Abstract: We introduce a variational scheme inspired by classical shadow tomography to
compute ground state correlations of quantum spin Hamiltonians. Shadow
tomography allows for efficient reconstruction of expectation values of
arbitrary observables from a bag of repeated, randomized measurements, called
snapshots, on copies of the state $\rho$. The prescription allows one to infer
expectation values of $M$ $k-$local observables to accuracy $\epsilon$ using
just $N \sim 3^k \text{log}M /\epsilon^2$ snapshots when measurements are
performed in locally random bases. Turning this around, a bag of snapshots can
be considered an efficient representation of the state $\rho$, particularly for
estimating low-weight observables, such as terms in a local Hamiltonian needed
to estimate the energy. Inspired by this, we consider a variational scheme
wherein a bag of $N$ parametrized snapshots is used to represent the putative
ground state of a desired local spin Hamiltonian and optimized to lower the
energy with respect to it. Additional constraints in the form of positivity of
reduced density matrices, motivated by work in quantum chemistry, are employed
to ensure compatibility of the predicted correlations with the underlying
Hilbert space. Unlike reduced density matrix approaches, learning the
underlying distribution of measurement outcomes allows one to further
correlations beyond those in the constrained density matrix. We show, with
numerical results, that the proposed variational method can be parallelized, is
efficiently simulable, and yields a more complete description of the ground
state.

*Christian W. Binder,Guido Burkard,Andrew J. Fisher*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to reduce 3D quantum dot description to 2D envelope function theory, integrating out the vertical dimension, capturing essential electrostatics, and highlighting the valley degree of freedom with computational efficiency and accuracy compared to naive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify computational models of quantum dots for studying electron spin qubits, leveraging dimensional reduction to enhance efficiency and understanding.

Method: The method uses the Born-Oppenheimer approximation at the envelope-function level, integrating out the vertical confinement. It considers the lowest two eigenstates for valley degree of freedom and derives an effective in-plane potential.

Result: The method is validated through 3D simulations, demonstrating superior accuracy and computational savings compared to naive 2D slicing, especially under interface roughness. It incorporates valley physics meaningfully, aiding qubit operation understanding.

Conclusion: The approach provides a computationally efficient, rigorous 2D model for quantum dots, capturing valley physics and exchange coupling, suitable for simulating two-electron systems.

Abstract: We present a rigorous method to reduce the three-dimensional (3D) description
of a quantum dot in silicon to an effective two-dimensional (2D) envelope
function theory for electron spin qubits. By systematically integrating out the
strongly confined vertical dimension using a Born-Oppenheimer-inspired ansatz
at the envelope-function level, we derive an effective in-plane potential that
faithfully captures the essential electrostatics of the full 3D system.
Considering the lowest two eigenstates of the out-of-plane direction, this
reduction leads to the natural and explicit emergence of the valley degree of
freedom within a 2D formalism, which is derived here from first principles. We
validate the accuracy of the method through comparisons with full 3D
simulations and demonstrate its superiority over naive 2D slicing, particularly
in the presence of interface roughness. Crucially, the reduction in
dimensionality leads to substantial computational savings, making our approach
particularly well suited for simulating two-electron systems, e.g., for the
extraction of parameters such as the exchange coupling. Beyond its practical
utility, the rigorous 2D envelope function theory that is introduced in this
study incorporates valley physics in a physically grounded manner, offering
conceptual clarity on the role of valley states in qubit operation and
measurement.

### [65] [Are controlled unitaries helpful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00055)
*Ewin Tang,John Wright*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of having access to controlled unitaries in quantum algorithms. It shows that having control over a qubit in a unitary operation does not provide significant benefits for a wide range of quantum problems. The authors demonstrate a method to decontrol such circuits, effectively removing the control qubit's influence and reducing the operation to a form that only preserves a random global phase. This has implications for understanding the limitations of quantum algorithms that rely on specific control structures. Additionally, the paper applies this technique to provide an alternative proof regarding the existence of pseudorandom quantum unitary ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore and clarify the role of controlled operations (cU) in quantum algorithms. By demonstrating that these controlled operations do not offer substantial advantages and by providing an efficient way to decontrol circuits, the authors contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of quantum algorithms and the resources they require.

Method: The authors generalize a result from an appendix of Sheridan, Maslov, and Mosca's 2009 work. They present a method to systematically remove the control qubit from any quantum circuit that uses controlled-U (cU) and controlled-U dagger (cU†) operations. Their approach involves modifying the circuit to eliminate the control dependency, resulting in a new circuit that only uses the original unitary U and its dagger U dagger. The output of this modified circuit is shown to differ from the original by a uniformly random global phase factor, which can be tolerated in certain contexts. The method also simplifies the analysis of quantum algorithms by providing a tool to assess their dependence on controlled operations.

Result: The main result is that having access to controlled unitaries (cU and cU†) in quantum circuits does not provide more computational power than having access only to U and U dagger. This is achieved by decontrolling the circuit, which means removing the control qubit's influence. The decontrolled circuit produces an output state that differs from the original by a single global phase, which is often irrelevant in quantum computations. This demonstrates that the controlled operations do not introduce any significant new capabilities beyond what is already possible with U and U dagger alone.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that controlled unitaries do not offer substantial benefits for a large class of quantum computing problems. The proposed method of decontrolling such circuits effectively removes the need for control qubits, showing that the additional operations do not increase the computational power. This finding is significant for the field as it challenges previous assumptions and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of quantum algorithm design and resource requirements. The method can be applied to various quantum algorithms to assess their reliance on controlled operations, leading to potential optimizations and a deeper appreciation of the limitations imposed by specific quantum gate setups.

Abstract: Many quantum algorithms, to compute some property of a unitary $U$, require
access not just to $U$, but to $cU$, the unitary with a control qubit. We show
that having access to $cU$ does not help for a large class of quantum problems.
For a quantum circuit which uses $cU$ and $cU^\dagger$ and outputs
$|\psi(U)\rangle$, we show how to ``decontrol'' the circuit into one which uses
only $U$ and $U^\dagger$ and outputs $|\psi(\varphi U)\rangle$ for a uniformly
random phase $\varphi$, with a small amount of time and space overhead. When we
only care about the output state up to a global phase on $U$, then the
decontrolled circuit suffices. Stated differently, $cU$ is only helpful because
it contains global phase information about $U$.
  A version of our procedure is described in an appendix of Sheridan, Maslov,
and Mosca [SMM09]. Our goal with this work is to popularize this result by
generalizing it and investigating its implications, in order to counter
negative results in the literature which might lead one to believe that
decontrolling is not possible. As an application, we give a simple proof for
the existence of unitary ensembles which are pseudorandom under access to $U$,
$U^\dagger$, $cU$, and $cU^\dagger$.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces replacement-type quantum gates using spin qubits and neutral atom qubits, which preserve noise bias through an extended Hilbert space, aiding advanced quantum architectures with error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a novel approach to quantum computing by introducing replacement-type gates, which could potentially enhance quantum computer architectures by preserving noise characteristics.

Method: The authors propose the concept of replacement-type gates, where candidate qubits are used to construct output qubits through displacement conditioned on input qubits. They realize these gates using spin and neutral atom qubits and mention the inclusion of position in the Hilbert space to preserve noise bias.

Result: An implementation of replacement-type X and CNOT gates using spin and neutral atom qubits, achieving noise bias preservation by extending the Hilbert space.

Conclusion: The introduction of these gates provides a new method for quantum computing that could lead to improved quantum error correction systems by maintaining qubit noise characteristics.

Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of
gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The
candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the
input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit
continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead
of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples
of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and
with neutral atom qubits. By making use of the extended Hilbert space,
including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the
innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise-bias which
motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with error correction.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种更高效的方法来估算截断误差，这对于量子模拟规范场具有重要意义，尤其是在精确计算规范理论时。

Abstract: The encoding of lattice gauge theories onto quantum computers requires a
discretization of the gauge field's Hilbert space on each link, which presents
errors with respect to the Kogut--Susskind limit. In the electric basis,
Hilbert space fragmentation has recently been shown to limit the excitation of
large electric fields. Here, we leverage this to develop a formalism for
estimating the size of truncation errors in the electric basis. Generically,
the truncation error falls off as a factorial of the field truncation. Examples
of this formalism are applied to the Schwinger model and a pure U(1) lattice
gauge theory. For reasonable choices of parameters, we improve on previous
error estimates by a factor of 10^{306}.

Abstract: Excited states of many-body quantum systems play a key role in a wide range
of physical and chemical phenomena. Unlike ground states, for which many
efficient variational techniques exist, there are few ways to systematically
construct excited states of generic quantum systems on either classical or
quantum hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce a general approach
that allows us to obtain arbitrary eigenstates of quantum systems at a given
energy. By combining the shift-invert mechanism with imaginary time evolution,
we are able to avoid explicit inversion of the Hamiltonian and construct
excited eigenstates of large many-body quantum systems. We demonstrate the
technique classically by applying it to large disordered spin chains. Based on
this approach, we propose a hybrid scheme suitable for near-future quantum
hardware.

Abstract: Designing quantum processors is a complex task that demands advanced
verification methods to ensure their correct functionality. However,
traditional methods of comprehensively verifying quantum devices, such as
quantum process tomography, face significant limitations because of the
exponential growth in computational resources. These limitations arise from
treating the system as a black box and ignoring its design structure.
Consequently, new testing methods must be developed considering the design
structure. In this paper, we investigate the structure of computations on the
hardware, focusing on the layered interruptible quantum circuit model and
designing a scalable algorithm to verify it comprehensively. Specifically, for
a given quantum hardware that claims to process an unknown $n$ qubit $d$ layer
circuit via a finite set of quantum gates, our method completely reconstructs
the circuits within a time complexity of $O(d^2 t \log (n/\delta))$,
guaranteeing success with a probability of at least $1-\delta$. Here, $t$
represents the maximum execution time for each circuit layer. Our approach
significantly reduces execution time for completely verifying computations in
quantum devices, achieving double logarithmic scaling in the problem size.
Furthermore, we validate our algorithm through experiments using IBM's quantum
cloud service, demonstrating its potential applicability in the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era.

Conclusion: 必须重新评估库仑主导的理论。

Abstract: Theoretical accounts of ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems commonly
assume that it arises from the interaction of an emitter with propagating
photon modes supported by a structure, understanding photons as the excitations
of the transverse electromagnetic field. This description discards the Coulomb
interaction between the emitter and structure charges. Here, we show with a
general argument based on electromagnetic constraints that the emitter-photon
coupling strength is fundamentally limited. Accordingly, we conclude that the
ultrastrong coupling regime cannot be reached with photons. Instead, it must
originate from the Coulomb interactions between charges. A further corollary is
that the so-called polarization self-energy term does not need to be included.
We illustrate our claims by solving an analytical model of the paradigmatic
case of an emitter next to a metallic nanosphere. These findings shed light on
the fundamental processes underlying ultrastrong coupling, clarify the role of
the polarization self-energy term and compel a reevaluation of previous
literature.

Abstract: Quantifying the entangling capability of quantum operations is a fundamental
task in quantum information science. Traditionally, this capability is measured
by the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated
when a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states.
However, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of
entanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric --
entangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement
generated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted
nature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework
that yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis reveals a
fundamental and previously unexplored physics: enhancing entangling capability
inevitably increases sensitivity, or bias, toward specific input states. By
analyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical
EP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of
entanglement generation can significantly differ depending on physical
implementation. Extending our framework to a class of generalized
controlled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary
dimensions, we (re)affirm the inherent trade-off between the entangling
strength and uniformity. Moreover, we uncover a subtle
dimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone
fails to detect. These findings highlight EPD as an indispensable diagnostic
tool -- one that, alongside EP, provides a deeper and more complete
characterization of the entangling structure.

Abstract: Non-Markovian effects are often significant when the system-environment
coupling is not weak. Indeed, we find the non-Markovianity to be negligible for
a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing via interaction with a
harmonic oscillator environment. In this paper, we examine a natural extension,
namely a pure dephasing model where a collection of two-level systems interacts
with a common environment. We obtain analytically the dynamics of the
collection of the two-level systems, and then take a partial trace over all the
two-level systems except one. This remaining single two-level system is shown
to display markedly non-Markovian dynamics, even in the weak system-environment
coupling regime. This is due to the indirect interaction between two-level
systems induced by their interaction with the common environment. In fact, this
indirect interaction can not only increase the non-Markovianity by orders of
magnitude, but also display qualitatively different characteristics. For
instance, for a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing, the dynamics
are Markovian for Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments. This is markedly not the
case when we consider multiple two-level systems. We also show that the
non-Markovianity increases as we increase the number of two-level systems.
These findings provide insights into controlling decoherence in multi-qubit
quantum systems and have implications for quantum technologies where
non-Markovianity can be a resource rather than a limitation.

Abstract: The entanglement properties of mixed states are of great importance in the
study of open quantum systems and quantum information science, but commonly
used entanglement measures, such as negativity, can be difficult to apply or
connect to physical properties of the system. We introduce the Cauchy-Schwarz
Violation (CSV) Condition, which has a simple dependence on the populations and
coherences of the density operator. A sufficient condition for entanglement, it
provides a more direct connection to the physical characteristics of the system
such as its symmetries. We illustrate the often surprising insights gained from
the CSV condition by applying it to the Jaynes-Cummings Model, the Quantum Rabi
Model, and an open-system Quantum Rabi Model.

*Ihor Sokolov,Yintai Zhang,Jacek Dziarmaga*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses optimizing tensor networks to improve compression efficiency by exploiting local correlations through bond optimization and zero modes of metric tensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tasks involving tensor networks often require efficient compression to manage computational resources. This inefficiency arises from internal correlations of networks with loops. The paper addresses this issue by proposing a method to optimize bond cuts, leveraging local correlations leading to better initial truncation errors in models like iPEPS and pMPS.

Method: The authors introduce a method where by cutting a bond, a set of states is defined whose linear dependence is eliminated using zero modes from the metric tensor. This allows for truncating the bond dimension more effectively.

Result: Through examples in iPEPS and pMPS, the method demonstrated that truncation errors are reduced compared to standard initialization, highlighting improved efficiency in handling loop correlations.

Conclusion: The method provides a promising approach for optimizing tensor networks by focusing on local bond optimization, leading to more efficient initial states with reduced truncation errors, thus enhancing overall computational efficiency in dealing with loop correlations in systems modeled by such networks.

Abstract: Loopy tensor networks have internal correlations that often make their
compression inefficient. We show that even local bond optimization can make
better use of the insight it has locally into relevant loop correlations. By
cutting the bond, we define a set of states whose linear dependence can be used
to truncate the bond dimension. The linear dependence is eliminated with zero
modes of the states' metric tensor. The method is illustrated by a series of
examples for the infinite pair entangled projected state (iPEPS) and for the
periodic matrix product state (pMPS) that occurs in the tensor renormalization
group (TRG) step. In all examples, it provides better initial truncation errors
than standard initialization.

Conclusion: 该实验展示了光-机械系统在反散逸率下的动态压缩效应，为量子信息和量子测量提供了新的工具和发展方向。

Abstract: We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is
dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR),
where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We
demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser
frequency-on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time-allows for
adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric
amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This
mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE),
leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that
the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified
by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not
only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time
scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in
their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the
Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical
features, including sub-Poissonian statistics, negative Wigner function and
quadrature squeezing which can be controlled by adjusting the system
parameters. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the
potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as
well as microwave quantum sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses quantum circuit synthesis, a critical task in quantum computing optimization, and brings forward a novel #SAT approach, which is appealing due to the potential advantages over traditional methods like improved accuracy and resource efficiency.

Method: The method involves encoding quantum circuit synthesis into #SAT problems using a #SAT solver, expanding the Maximum Model Counter, and then solving these instances to find optimal circuits.

Result: Experiments using an open-source tool modified to handle complex weights demonstrate the potential effectiveness of classical tools in quantum circuit synthesis.

Conclusion: The work opens new avenues for enhancing quantum circuit synthesis through model counting, suggesting that classical methods could play a significant role in quantum computing advancements.

Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis is the task of decomposing a given quantum operator
into a sequence of elementary quantum gates. Since the finite target gate set
cannot exactly implement any given operator, approximation is often necessary.
Model counting, or #SAT, has recently been demonstrated as a promising new
approach for tackling core problems in quantum circuit analysis. In this work,
we show for the first time that the universal quantum circuit synthesis problem
can be reduced to maximum model counting. We formulate a #SAT encoding for
exact and approximate depth-optimal quantum circuit synthesis into the
Clifford+T gate set. We evaluate our method with an open-source implementation
that uses the maximum model counter d4Max as a backend. For this purpose, we
extended d4Max with support for complex and negative weights to represent
amplitudes. Experimental results show that existing classical tools have
potential for the quantum circuit synthesis problem.

*Yan-Ying Zhu,Bin-Bin Cai,Fei Gao,Song Lin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive security analysis of the FBC algorithm against quantum adversaries with various query capabilities. It introduces quantum distinguishers and key-recovery attacks that significantly reduce the time complexity compared to classical brute-force methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation likely stems from the increasing relevance of quantum computing in cryptography, as quantum attacks pose a new threat to traditionally secure symmetric cryptographic methods.

Method: The paper uses quantum query models Q1 and Q2 to analyze FBC algorithm security. It designs polynomial-time quantum distinguishers and key-recovery attacks, applying mathematical complexity analysis and Grover's algorithm.

Result: The attacks reduce the time complexity by a factor of 2^(4.5n) and require fewer resources compared to classical brute-force methods, undermining the algorithm's security.

Conclusion: The findings highlight vulnerabilities in FBC when quantum computing is introduced, necessitating a review of cryptographic standards and protocols to protect against such quantum threats.

Abstract: With the advancement of quantum computing, symmetric cryptography faces new
challenges from quantum attacks. These attacks are typically classified into
two models: Q1 (classical queries) and Q2 (quantum superposition queries). In
this context, we present a comprehensive security analysis of the FBC algorithm
considering quantum adversaries with different query capabilities. In the Q2
model, we first design 4-round polynomial-time quantum distinguishers for FBC-F
and FBC-KF structures, and then perform $r(r>6)$-round quantum key-recovery
attacks. Our attacks require $O(2^{(2n(r-6)+3n)/2})$ quantum queries, reducing
the time complexity by a factor of $2^{4.5n}$ compared with quantum brute-force
search, where $n$ denotes the subkey length. Moreover, we give a new 6-round
polynomial-time quantum distinguisher for FBC-FK structure. Based on this, we
construct an $r(r>6)$-round quantum key-recovery attack with complexity
$O(2^{n(r-6)})$. Considering an adversary with classical queries and quantum
computing capabilities, we demonstrate low-data quantum key-recovery attacks on
FBC-KF/FK structures in the Q1 model. These attacks require only a constant
number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs, then use the Grover algorithm to search
the intermediate states, thereby recovering all keys in $O(2^{n/2})$ time.

Abstract: The maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree reconstruction problem is NP-hard,
presenting a computational bottleneck for classical computing and motivating
the exploration of emerging paradigms like quantum computing. To this end, we
design three optimization models compatible with both classical and quantum
solvers. Our method directly searches the complete solution space of all
possible tree topologies and ancestral states, thereby avoiding the potential
biases associated with pre-constructing candidate internal nodes. Among these
models, the branch-based model drastically reduces the number of variables and
explicit constraints through a specific variable definition, providing a novel
modeling approach effective not only for phylogenetic tree building but also
for other tree problems. The correctness of this model is validated with a
classical solver, which obtains solutions that are generally better than those
from heuristics on the GAPDH gene dataset. Moreover, our quantum simulations
successfully find the exact optimal solutions for small-scale instances with
rapid convergence, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to offer a
new avenue for solving these intractable problems in evolutionary biology.

Conclusion: 开发出新的量子算法工程方法，抛弃宏观结构，关注微参数的统计特性。

Abstract: The compression of quantum circuits is a foundational challenge for near-term
quantum computing, yet the principles governing circuit stability remain poorly
understood. We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical
analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits.
Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally
bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of
this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but
is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation
parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of
``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a
scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for
this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are
counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most
pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why
statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under
compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient
quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the
microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了高效的并行边值决策图，并将其应用于量子计算的模拟和等价性检查，展示了其高效性和优越性。

Abstract: As physical realizations of quantum computers move closer towards practical
applications, the need for tools to analyze and verify quantum algorithms
grows. Among the algorithms and data structures used to tackle such problems,
decision diagrams (DDs) have shown much success. However, an obstacle with DDs
is their efficient parallelization, and while parallel speedups have been
obtained for DDs used in classical applications, attempts to parallelize
operations for quantum-specific DDs have yielded only limited success. In this
work, we present an efficient implementation of parallel edge-valued DDs, which
makes use of fine-grained task parallelism and lock-free hash tables.
Additionally, we use these DDs to implement two use cases: simulation and
equivalence checking of quantum circuits. In our empirical evaluation we find
that our tool, Q-Sylvan, shows a single-core performance that is competitive
with the state-of-the-art quantum DD tool MQT DDSIM on large instances, and
moreover achieves parallel speedups of up to x18 on 64 cores.

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum repeater using GKP codes for both flying and stationary qubits, combining one-way and two-way schemes to balance high node losses, high squeezing, and large segment lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to optimize long-range quantum communication by integrating error correction and different quantum schemes to enhance efficiency and scalability.

Method: They use the GKP code within a hybrid approach, combining one-way and two-way quantum repeaters to address transmission and memory loss issues.

Result: The proposed approach improves scalability and reduces requirements compared to individual one-way or two-way schemes.

Conclusion: Combining different quantum repeater methods provides a more versatile and efficient solution for long-distance quantum communication.

Abstract: There are various approaches to long-range quantum communication based on
conceptually different forms of quantum repeaters. Here we explore a quantum
repeater scheme that employs quantum error correction (QEC) both on the flying
(light) qubits and on the stationary (matter) qubits. The idea is to combine
the benefits of encoded one-way and two-way schemes where effective channel
transmission and loss scaling are enhanced by means of photon loss codes and
encoded quantum memories, respectively, while sacrificing some of their
advantages such as high clock rates, independent of classical communication
times (one-way), and potentially large segment lengths (two-way). More
specifically, we illustrate, propose, and analyze such a quantum repeater using
the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code which naturally enables
encoding and QEC of qudits, protecting them against transmission and memory
loss, the latter, for instance, occuring on collective spin modes of atomic
ensembles. While the encoded one-way and two-way schemes on their own either
require very high repeater link coupling efficiencies and GKP squeezing or
allow for experimentally more feasible, small values of these parameters,
respectively, we find that there are intermediate parameter regimes where the
combined repeater protocol is superior.

Abstract: We study quantum coherence in continuous-time quantum walks on perfect graphs
generated by the symmetric lift ${\mathrm{HL}}'_2(G)$, a canonical, unweighted,
undirected construction defined as the line graph of a bipartite double cover
of $G$. This lift acts as both a coherence-preserving and coherence-inducing
transformation: it preserves and scales structured quantum interference in
highly symmetric base graphs, and induces sustained coherence in random or
weakly structured ones.
  In small graphs such as $K_4$, $K_5$, and the Petersen graph, where quantum
walks exhibit sharp revivals and high return probability, repeated
$\mathrm{HL}'_2$ lifting produces towers of perfect graphs with thousands to
tens of thousands of vertices that retain periodic or quasi-periodic coherence.
When applied to random regular or Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs with flat or
decaying return behavior, the lift introduces structured interference and
significant amplification of mean and peak return probabilities.
  To quantify these effects, we evaluate standard coherence metrics from
quantum resource theory, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), purity,
relative entropy of coherence, and the logarithmic coherence number. These
measures confirm that $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ lifting delocalizes eigenstates,
increases coherence entropy, and expands the basis support of quantum states.
These results demonstrate that $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ is a scalable and structurally
grounded mechanism for organizing quantum interference, and introduce a new
family of perfect graphs that support long-time quantum coherence without
spectral tuning or engineered weights.

Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the utility of entanglement swapping by moving beyond qubits to higher-dimensional systems, which can potentially improve quantum communication networks.

Method: They theoretically extend the concept to qudits and use concurrence and negativity to quantify swapped entanglement, likely simulating or calculating the dynamics under various noise conditions.

Result: Higher-dimensional systems show improved swapped entanglement and are applicable for robust teleportation and repeater networks, though noise impacts performance.

Conclusion: Moving to higher dimensions with entanglement swapping can significantly boost quantum communication technologies, particularly in teleportation and repeater networks, but noise must be mitigated for reliability.

Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a fundamental protocol in quantum information
processing that enables the distribution of entanglement between distant
quantum systems. In this work, we first extend the concept of entanglement
swapping to higher-dimensional quantum systems, specifically qudits. We then
analyze the dynamics of entanglement swapping and quantify the average swapped
entanglement in terms of concurrence and negativity. Our results demonstrate
that higher-dimensional systems offer enhanced entanglement distribution
capabilities compared to qubit-based protocols. We also discuss the application
of entangled qudits in terms of long-distance teleportation that provides the
base for quantum repeaters. Furthermore, we discuss the entanglement swapping
for a real and noisy system. The behaviors of entanglement against fidelity
with different dimensions are also discussed.

Abstract: Magic or non-stabilizerness is a resource for quantum computing that has been
extensively studied in qudit networks. It describes the degree to which
Clifford gates cannot generate a given state, capturing the advantage of
quantum over classical computing. However, its definition in continuous

Abstract: Quantum Information Networks (QIN) attract increasing interest, as they will
enable interconnection of multiple quantum devices in a distributed
organization thus enhancing intrinsic computing, sensing, and security
capabilities. The core mechanism of a QIN is quantum state swapping, based on
teleportation, which consumes quantum entanglement, and which can be seen in
this context as a new kind of network resource. The satellite is expected to
play a central role for supporting global connectivity in such novel networks
in which ground fiber links have stringent restrictions in length due to the
absorption losses in optical fibers. There is indeed fundamental limits in the
maximal fiber links distance which may not be exceeded for any unitary links.
In this paper we clarify our motivations to develop such networks with
satellites, and we discuss their associated use cases based on entanglement
distribution, and we present the future potential users. We also assess
quantitatively the ranges for which the satellite becomes mandatory in quantum
information networks.

Abstract: Periodically structured surfaces (metasurfaces), i.e., periodic light, have
evolved as a powerful tool for manipulating electromagnetic fields both in
classical and quantum regimes. However, no general approach for quantizing the
electromagnetic fields and treating quantum light-matter interactions in such
structures exists. Here, we construct an ab initio few-mode quantization scheme
for metasurface resonances based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. We use
our approach to propose a framework for strong light-matter coupling in which
collective excitations of periodic arrays of quantum emitters are strongly
coupled to the light modes supported by the metasurface, leading to the
formation of crystal polaritons. As a proof-of-principle example of their
potential, we show that interactions between crystal polaritons can lead to an
efficient and directional generation of entangled photon pairs.

### [91] [Statistical Mechanics of Random Mixed State Ensembles with Fixed Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00809)
*Harry J. D. Miller*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a study on random density matrices with fixed average energy, introducing a microcanonical ensemble. They derive the average density matrix and connect its entropy and temperature properties, finding phase transitions and finite energy fluctuations without interactions and in the thermodynamic limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the statistical properties of mixed quantum states with a fixed average energy, extending beyond traditional Bures-Hall and Hilbert-Schmidt measures. The motivation comes from understanding typical features of mixed states under physical constraints, possibly to model realistic quantum systems or to analyze quantum statistical mechanics.

Method: The authors seem to derive an average density matrix for an ensemble where the average energy is fixed. They would use mathematical derivations involving constraints and possibly Lagrange multipliers. They connect the derived ensemble to entropy and temperature via statistical mechanics.

Result: The results show that fixed energy ensembles can exhibit phase transitions even without interactions and have finite relative energy fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of quantum statistical mechanics by introducing a microcanonical ensemble for random states with fixed average energy, revealing phase transitions and thermodynamic behaviors typical of isolated quantum systems.

Abstract: Mixed state ensembles such as the Bures-Hall and Hilbert-Schmidt measure are
probability distributions that characterise the statistical properties of
random density matrices and can be used to determine the typical features of
mixed quantum states. Here we extend this framework by considering the
properties of random states with fixed average energy, and the
ensemble-averaged density matrix is derived under this additional physical
constraint. This gives rise to a type of microcanonical ensemble for random
mixed states and we connect its properties to a statistical mechanical entropy
and temperature. Our results are illustrated using a variety of simple spin
systems, and we find that they can exhibit exotic features such as phase
transitions in the absence of interactions and finite relative energy
fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit.

Method: 论文通过扩展熵计算，以部分纠缠的多态量子态和完全互补关系为框架，分析了纠缠交换的上界，计算不同量子体系的平均分配纠缠度，并提出了猜想。

Conclusion: 该论文为部分纠缠多态量子态在纠缠交换协议中的应用提供了新的分析框架，扩展了二元情况的研究，提出了关于纠缠度上界的新猜想，揭示了量子互补性与纠缠交换之间的关系。

Abstract: We extend the entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) to partially entangled
qudit states and analyze the process within the framework of complete
complementarity relations (CCRs). Building on previous results for qubits, we
show that the average distributed entanglement between two parties via ESP is
bounded above by the initial entanglement of one of the input pairs, and also
by the product of the initial entanglements. Notably, we find that using
initial states with vanishing local quantum coherence is sufficient to capture
the essential features of the protocol, simplifying the analysis. By exploring
the cases of qubits and qutrits, we observe that the upper bound on the average
distributed entanglement -- expressed in terms of the product of the initial
entanglements -- can be improved, and we conjecture what this tighter bound
might be. Finally, we discuss the role of quantum complementarity in the ESP
and show how local predictability constrains the entanglement that can be
operationally distributed via ESP.

Result: 计算结果与实验值的误差约为2eV，与分子计算结果相当，低标量缩放方法误差稍大。

Conclusion: 该方法在固体内计算束缚能表现出较高的准确性，适用于后续研究。然而，低标量缩放近似方法在计算成本与精度之间有权衡。需要进一步研究其应用范围和优化潜力。

Abstract: We report the core binding energies of K-edge and L-edge transitions in
simple semiconducting and insulating solids using periodic equation-of-motion
coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD). In our
all-electron calculations, we use triple zeta basis sets with core correlation,
and we sample the Brillouin zone using up to 4x4x4 k-points. Our final numbers,
which are obtained through composite corrections and extrapolation to the
thermodynamic limit, exhibit errors of about 2 eV when compared to experimental
values. This level of accuracy from CCSD is about the same as it is for
molecules. A low-scaling approximation to EOM-CCSD performs marginally worse at
lower cost, with errors of about 3 eV.

Abstract: Hybrid oscillator architectures that combine feedback oscillators with
self-sustained negative resistance oscillators have emerged as a promising
platform for artificial neuron design. In this work, we introduce a modeling
and analysis framework for amplifier-assisted organic electrochemical neurons,
leveraging nonlinear dynamical systems theory. By formulating the system as
coupled differential equations describing membrane voltage and internal state
variables, we identify the conditions for self-sustained oscillations and
characterize the resulting dynamics through nullclines, phase-space analysis,
and bifurcation behavior, providing complementary insight to standard
circuit-theoretic arguments of the operation of oscillators. Our simplified yet
rigorous model enables tractable analysis of circuits integrating classical
feedback components (e.g., operational amplifiers) with novel devices
exhibiting negative differential resistance, such as organic electrochemical
transistors (OECT). This approach reveals the core mechanisms behind
oscillation generation, demonstrating the utility of dynamic systems theory in
understanding and designing complex hybrid circuits. Beyond neuromorphic and
bioelectronic applications, the proposed framework offers a generalizable
foundation for developing tunable, biologically inspired oscillatory systems in
sensing, signal processing, and adaptive control.

### [95] [Radially Locked Sun-Ray Patterns in Autocatalytic Reaction-Diffusion-Advection Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00329)

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: The study explores how traveling fronts can develop patterns influenced by advection and diffusion, specifically in the chlorite-tetrathionate reaction. It shows that by tuning flow rate and diffusion ratio, new patterns like sun-ray structures can emerge and control the patterns through linear stability analysis and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the formation of complex patterns in traveling fronts is important in various scientific fields. This study aims to investigate how external factors like advection and diffusion affect these patterns, potentially leading to new insights in reaction-diffusion systems.

Method: The researchers conducted theoretical analysis, nonlinear simulations, and experiments using the chlorite-tetrathionate reaction as a model system. They specifically looked at how different flow rates and diffusion ratios influence the patterns.

Result: The study found that when fronts are radially advected and the autocatalyst and reactant have different diffusion rates, sun-ray-like patterns can emerge around the fronts. Linear stability analysis and simulations supported this, and experiments confirmed the findings.

Conclusion: This research provides a framework for controlling complex patterns in traveling fronts through adjustable flow and diffusion parameters, with implications for controlling patterns in various natural and engineered systems.

Abstract: Traveling fronts ubiquitous in physics, chemistry, and biology are prone to
transverse cellular deformations due to diffusive or convective instabilities.
Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that new patterns can be
obtained if the destabilization is triggered around a front locked radially by
advection. Specifically, angularly shifting sun-ray-like patterns can develop
around radially advected autocatalytic fronts due to a diffusive instability
developing when the autocatalyst X and the reactant Y diffuse at different
rates. The properties of these shining-star structures can be controlled by
tuning the flow rate $Q$ and the ratio of diffusion coefficients $\delta$ as
evidenced by linear stability analysis, nonlinear simulations, and experiments
on the chlorite-tetrathionate reaction.

Motivation: 双重极化光是研究光的来源和传播介质的重要工具，当能量高于数十MeV时，双极子生产成为主要的相互作用方式，如何有效测量双极子的极化状态对理解双极子物理和相关介质效应具有重要意义。

Method: 研究采用了一种将monolithic active pixel传感器和低密度延伸固体 converters相结合的新架构，这种设计提高了双极子 Polarimeter的效率，并扩展了其分析能力的范围。

Result: 该双极子 Polarimeter的效率达到了约7%，分析能力（analyzing power）在0.2到0.5之间，显示出在高能量（multi-GeV）下有效的测量能力。

Conclusion: 这种新型设备不仅提升了双极子 Polarimeter的性能，还为多粒子物理和探索基本物理常数的潜在变化提供了新的观测工具。

Abstract: Accessing the polarization of photon allows to understand the mechanisms
behind its emission or scattering, revealing much about a peculiar environment
or a probed object. For energy above $\sim$10~MeV, the pair production
dominates the photon-matter interaction and the photon polarization is
accessible via the azimuthal angle of the conversion. Unfortunately pair
polarimeters have a low figure-of-merit for multi-GeV photons and are mostly
used for beam characterization. In this paper, we report a new concept of a
compact pair polarimeter associating monolithic active pixel sensors to
low-density extended solid converters to reach simultaneously a high efficiency
of $\sim$7\% and intrinsic analyzing power ranging from 0.2 to 0.5. This new
concept will add a new obersvable to the multi-messenger physics, isolate the
intrinsic strong force in nucleons and possibly reveal violations of Lorentz
invariance.

Abstract: This study explores the use of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for detecting
low-energy beta particles from tritium decay - a critical signal for nuclear
safety, nuclear nonproliferation, and environmental monitoring. We employ a
dual approach utilizing both measured CCD data and detailed Geant4 simulations.
Our analysis compares classical techniques with advanced deep learning methods,
including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders trained
exclusively on tritium data, and preliminary studies on boosted decision trees
(BDTs). The CNN, trained on mixed signal/background datasets, demonstrates
superior classification performance, while the autoencoder shows the potential
of unsupervised, background-agnostic strategies. These results highlight the
excellent sensitivity achievable thanks to the background rejection made
possible by information-rich CCD data, paving the way for improved portable
tritium monitoring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to confirm the integrity and reliability of the detectors used in high-energy physics experiments, ensuring accurate data collection and reducing experimental errors due to sensor issues.

Method: The paper details a test bench setup and uses statistical analysis on 1100+ MAPMTs to measure key performance metrics and assess long-term aging.

Result: The MAPMTs show consistent performance across units, with slight variations in metrics like afterpulses, and aging effects manifest as gradual performance degradation especially in high light output conditions.

Conclusion: The study concludes that MAPMTs are reliable but require careful monitoring of aging to maintain detector performance and data quality.

Abstract: Both the future CBM-RICH and the recently upgraded HADES-RICH use Hamamatsu
H12700 Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMTs) as their photon detectors. To test
the MAPMTs thoroughly before using them in the detectors, the photon sensors
were qualified well in advance and a test bench was built to efficiently
characterize each MAPMT. The test bench measures the single photoelectron gain,
dark rate, relative efficiency, and afterpulse probability of each channel.
This article describes the operating principle of the test bench and discusses
the distributions of each measured quantity over 1,100 MAPMTs. Additionally,
the long-term aging effects of the H12700 MAPMT are investigated based on
repeated measurements of individual MAPMTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the need for more precise and efficient energy measurements despite the limitations of existing systems.

Method: A shaper circuit was developed and tested in the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector at FAIR.

Result: The system shows improved energy measurement precision without sacrificing the advantages of low-power and wide bandwidth.

Conclusion: The proposed shaper circuit enhances energy deposition measurements in detectors, contributing to better data accuracy in high-energy experiments.

Abstract: The quantitative measurement of energy deposits in particle detectors,
particularly in calorimeters, is usually accomplished with the help of
Analog-to-Digital converters (ADCs) due to their precision, wide measurement
range, and good linearity. However, drawbacks such as power consumption, data
volume, and bandwidth limit their use in the next generation of high-energy
physics experiments. Time-over-threshold (ToT) systems offer simplicity, low
power consumption, easy integrability, and wide bandwidth, but they lack
precision, linearity, and dynamic range. In this work, we propose a shaper
circuit that improves the weaknesses of ToT systems without sacrificing
performance. We simulated and implemented the concept in the readout system of
the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the Compressed Baryonic Matter
experiment at FAIR.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed
in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the
regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath
particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath,
using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical
ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around
the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted
by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for
the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is
found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a
hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding
prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition
probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself.
Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose
polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in
optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be
modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.

their interaction with the two laser fields. We apply adiabatic elimination of
the electronic excited state to reduce the size of the dressed-state basis in
which the dressed Hamiltoninan is expressed. In an application, we investigate
the feasibility of two-photon collisional shielding between two \NaK molecules,
which could be favored by the Raman resonance condition suppressing unwanted
spontaneous emission and photon scattering. We demonstrate the influence of the
laser Rabi frequencies on the dynamics through the computation of elastic,
inelastic, and reactive collision rates.

*Alonso Perez-Lona,Eric Sharpe,Xingyang Yu,Hao Zhang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses decomposition in QFT with continuous families of universes, focusing on eliminating instantons through topological gauging. It applies this to 2D U(1) gauge theories and supersymmetric models, exploring phenomena like the Witten effect and anomalies. The limits of the Tanizaki-Unsal construction are also considered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding decomposition in QFT is crucial for studying how local theories can be equivalent to unions of independent theories. This paper extends decomposition to continuous families, which hasn't been deeply explored, thus providing new insights and applications in 2D gauge theories and supersymmetric models.

Method: The analysis begins by discussing the mathematical framework of decomposition, generalizing from finite to continuous families. Specific cases, such as U(1) gauge theories and supersymmetric models, are examined by analyzing their behavior under topological gauging and exploring the implications for phenomena like the Witten effect and anomalies. The paper also evaluates the limits of the Tanizaki-Unsal construction by considering how topological operations affect the structure of these theories.

Result: The paper reveals that decomposition with continuous universes allows for effective instanton suppression through topological gauging. It elucidates how this affects the structure of Maxwell theories, supersymmetric models, and the relationships between anomalies in individual sectors and the entire theory. The paper also highlights both the success and limitations of the Tanizaki-Unsal construction in this context.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues in QFT by considering continuous families of universes, offering a deeper understanding of decomposition mechanisms and their applications to various 2D theories, including those with significant physical implications such as anomalies and instanton effects. The findings suggest that decomposition can be a powerful tool for studying non-perturbative phenomena in Quantum Field Theories.

Abstract: In this note we consider examples of decomposition (in which a local QFT is
equivalent to a disjoint union of multiple independent theories, known as
universes) where there is a continuous familiy of universes, rather than a
finite or countably infinite collection. In particular, this allows us to
consistently eliminate all instantons in a local QFT via a suitable topological
gauging of the (-1)-form symmetry. In two-dimensional U(1) gauge theories, this
is equivalent to changing the gauge gruop to R. This makes both locality as
well as the instanton restriction explicit. We apply this to clarify the
Gross-Taylor string interpretation of the decomposition of two-dimensional pure
Yang-Mills. We also apply decomposition to study two-dimensional R gauge
theories, such as the pure R Maxwell theory, and two-dimensional supersymmetric
gauged linear sigma models whose gauge groups have factors of R. In that
context, we find that analogues of the Witten effect for dyons, here rotating
between universes, play a role in relating anomalies of the individual
universes to (different) anomalies in the disjoint union. Finally, we discuss
limits of the Tanizaki-Unsal construction, which accomplish instanton
restriction by topologically gauging a Q/Z (-1)-form symmetry, and speculate in
two-dimensional theories on possible interpretations of those limits in terms
of the adelic solenoid.

Result: 研究结果表明，体积与包容性指数之间存在直接关系，并且在量子复杂性和体积增长中有应用。

Conclusion: 提出了体积与指数之间的新关系，丰富了量子复杂性与引力理论的联系。

Abstract: We propose a new way to understand the volume of certain subregions in the
bulk of AdS spacetime by relating it to an algebraic quantity known as the
index of inclusion. This index heuristically measures the relative size of a
subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$ embedded within a larger algebra $\mathcal{M}$.
According to subregion-subalgebra duality, bulk subregions are described by von
Neumann algebras on the boundary. When a causally complete bulk subregion
corresponds to the relative commutant $\mathcal{N}' \cap \mathcal{M}$ -- the
set of operators in $\mathcal{M}$ that commute with $\mathcal{N}$ -- of
boundary subalgebras, we propose that the exponential of the volume of the
maximal volume slice of the subregion equals the index of inclusion. This
``volume-index'' relation provides a new boundary explanation for the growth of
interior volume in black holes, reframing it as a change in the relative size
of operator algebras. It offers a complementary perspective on complexity
growth from the Heisenberg picture, and has a variety of other applications,
including quantifying the relative size of algebras dual to the entanglement
wedge and the causal wedge of a boundary region, as well as quantifying the
violation of additivity of operator algebras in the large $N$ limit. Finally,
it may offer insights into the volume growth of de Sitter space through the
changes in North and South pole observer algebras in time.

### [104] [Entanglement spreading and emergent locality in Brownian SYK chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00060)
*Onkar Parrikar,Jatin Narde,Harshit Rajgadia,Sandip Trivedi*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores the spread of quantum information in a one-dimensional Brownian SYK chain and finds a sharp light-cone with an information transition at the butterfly velocity. The findings suggest a non-linear diffusion process described by the FKPP equation underlies this phenomenon, indicating underlying chaos and operator growth properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Ryu-Takayanagi formula connects entanglement entropy with quantum error correction, suggesting emergent locality. The paper uses tools from QEC to test this in a chaotic model, aiming to understand information spread and dual bulk theories.

Method: The authors model a Brownian SYK chain, inject a qudit, and use the FKPP equation to compute information correlations. They find a sharp transition in information at a length scale proportional to v_B*T, linking it to butterfly velocity.

Result: Measured information shows a sharp transition at ℓ ~ v_B*T, consistent with a light-cone. The transition is explained by a non-linear diffusion process, revealing connections between quantum chaos, operator growth, and information scrambling.

Conclusion: Testing the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture in a chaotic model confirms the emergence of a sharp light-cone. The results suggest that quantum chaos and operator scrambling are key to understanding information propagation in holographic theories. The non-linear diffusion model offers a new angle for studying quantum error correction in chaotic systems.

Abstract: The Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula and its interpretation in terms of quantum
error correction (QEC) implies an emergent locality for the spread of quantum
information in holographic CFTs, where information injected at a point in the
boundary theory spreads within a sharp light-cone corresponding to the
butterfly velocity. This emergent locality is a necessary condition for the
existence of a geometric bulk dual with an RT-like formula for entanglement
entropy. In this paper, we use tools from QEC to study the spread of quantum
information and the emergence of a sharp light-cone in an analytically
tractable model of chaotic dynamics, namely a one-dimensional Brownian SYK
chain. We start with an infinite temperature state in this model and inject a
qudit at time $t=0$ at some point $p$ on the chain. We then explicitly
calculate the amount of information of the qudit contained in an interval of
length $2\ell$ (centered around $p$) at some later time $t=T$. We find that at
strong coupling, this quantity shows a sharp transition as a function of $\ell$
from near zero to near maximal correlation. The transition occurs at $\ell \sim
v_B T$, with $v_B$ being the butterfly velocity. Underlying the emergence of
this sharp light-cone is a non-linear generalization of the diffusion equation
called the FKPP equation, which admits sharp domain wall solutions at late
times and strong coupling. These domain wall solutions can be understood on
physical grounds from properties of operator growth in chaotic systems.

Abstract: Sen's action for chiral bosons in 2 dimensions describes two chiral scalars,
one of which couples to the physical metric and one of which couples to a flat
metric. It has a generalisation in which the flat metric is replaced by an
arbitrary second metric and so can be formulated on any curved world-sheet.
When the two metrics are equal, the theory reduces to a $\beta \gamma$ system,
giving a non-unitary $c=2$ conformal field theory. We argue that the relation
between this and the theory of two chiral bosonic scalars of the same chirality
can be viewed as a \lq bosonisation'. We show that the standard vertex
operators for the chiral scalars are vertex operators and line operators in the
Sen formulation and derive the formulation in the Sen theory of correlation
functions in the chiral scalar theory. The flat space Sen theory can be coupled
to two different world-sheet metrics in such a way that one scalar couples to
one metric and the other to the other metric, so obtaining the general
formulation with two metrics.
  In $d=4k+2$ dimensions, the bi-metric action for a $2k$-form gauge field with
self-dual field strength reduces, when the two metrics are equal, to a
conformal field theory with a $BF$-type action, except that $B$ is a self-dual
$d/2$-form and $F$ is a $d/2$-form field strength, $F=dP$. The self-duality of
$B$ means that this is not a topological theory but instead represents two
self-dual gauge fields. This has a generalisation to a democratic action for
$p$-form gauge fields in any dimension.

### [106] [Holographic Wilson Loop One-point Functions in ABJM Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00281)
*Xiao-Yi Zhang,Yunfeng Jiang,Jun-Bao Wu*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Their study computes the correlation between a Wilson loop and a local operator in ABJM theory using M-theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. They found agreement between their results and supersymmetric localization for large N with finite k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to contribute to the understanding of loop-operator correlators in ABJM theory by leveraging the AdS/CFT duality and M-theory descriptions, offering a gauge/gravity correspondence perspective. Additionally, the comparison with existing results might help validate the dualities and deepen the understanding of localization techniques.

Method: They employed the AdS/CFT correspondence, which involves mapping Wilson loops and local operators to M2-branes in an M-theory background. The S^7/Z_k space is part of the AdS4xS7/Zk geometry, and by studying probe M2-brane fluctuations, they computed the correlators. Supersymmetric localization provided the benchmark for comparison.

Result: Their analytic results for the correlators match existing literature results under large N and finite k, showing agreement between the holographic computation and localization methods.

Conclusion: The agreement validates the AdS/CFT predictions for Wilson loop correlators in ABJM theory and provides support for the use of supersymmetric localization as a tool in studying such physics. It also highlights the consistency between gauge theory and gravity approaches at the large N limit.

Abstract: We compute the correlation function between a circular half-BPS Wilson loop
(or straight Wilson line) and a local operator in ABJM theory utilizing its
M-theory description. The local operator can be a $1/3$-BPS single-trace chiral
primary operator or the stress-energy tensor. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence,
these correlators are dual to fluctuations of a probe M2-brane in $AdS_4 \times
S^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$. We derive analytic results for both cases and compare them
with existing results based on supersymmetric localization in the literature.
In the large-$N$ limit with $k$ finite, our holograkphic results exhibit
perfect agreement with localization.

Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and
quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature
constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear
electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and
significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs
spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of
divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the
thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds
of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of
curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular
quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number
$n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that
thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical
information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and
dynamical properties.

Abstract: We study the decomposition of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories with Lie
algebras of type $\mathfrak{su}(N)$, $\mathfrak{so}(2N)$, and
$\mathfrak{e}_{6}$, realized via M-theory geometric engineering. These
theories, together with their novel decomposition structure, arise from
quotienting the Bryant--Salamon spin bundle over the 3-sphere by special finite
subgroups acting simultaneously on both the fiber and base. We show that these
gauge theories admit both inner and outer automorphisms, enabling sequences of
gauge theory breaking. In particular, outer automorphisms extend the
decomposition structure to theories with $\mathfrak{so}(2N+1)$,
$\mathfrak{sp}(2N)$, $\mathfrak{f}_{4}$, and $\mathfrak{g}_{2}$ gauge algebras.
For these theories, including both simply-laced and non-simply-laced cases, we
analyze their $p$-form symmetries, including $(-1)$-form symmetries, derive the
corresponding SymTFTs, and identify the M-theoretic origin of their symmetry
topological operators and defects. Finally, we demonstrate that these gauge
theories exhibit modified instanton sums and higher 4-group structures, and we
derive the associated topological sector directly from M-theory.

### [109] [Higher spin fields and the field strength multicopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00711)
*Graham R. Brown,Bill Spence*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses extending the Weyl double copy concept to higher spin fields, called multi-copies, and relates them to sums of Maxwell tensor powers. It uses Kerr-Schild coordinates and spacetime dimensions, exploring spinor and vector superspace formalisms. The multi-copies are particularly transparent in four dimensions with spinor methods but reveal new features in higher dimensions. The paper also applies to anti-de Sitter backgrounds with an alternative covariant derivative definition. Overall, the submission provides a detailed analysis of higher spin generalizations using various formalisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper extends the Weyl double copy concept to higher spin fields, offering a unified approach through different formalisms for analysis.

Method: The paper employs several formalisms: Kerr-Schild coordinates, spinor methods, vector superspace, and considers anti-de Sitter backgrounds with covariant derivatives. Each formalism is used to explore aspects of higher spin fields' multi-copies and their relation to Maxwell tensors.

Result: The paper successfully generalizes the Weyl double copy to higher spin, providing a framework for studying these fields through multiple approaches, revealing new features across different spacetime dimensions.

Conclusion: The generalization significantly contributes to understanding higher spin fields through various formalisms and provides promising directions for future research by highlighting new features across different dimensions and contexts.

Abstract: We discuss the generalisation of the Weyl double copy to higher spin
"multi-copies", showing how the natural linearised higher spin field strengths
can be related to sums of powers of the Maxwell tensor. The tracelessness of
the field strength involves the appropriate Fronsdal equations of motion for
the higher spin field. We work with spacetimes admitting Kerr-Schild
coordinates and give a number of examples in different dimensions. We note that
the multi-copy is particularly transparent in four dimensions if one uses
spinor descriptions of the fields, relating this to the Penrose transform. The
higher-dimensional spinor multicopy is also explored and reveals some
interesting new features arising from the little group based identification of
higher spin field strengths and Maxwell tensor types. We then turn to the
vector superspace formalism describing higher spin and `continuous' spin
representations given by Schuster and Toro, based on symmetric tensor fields.
Here the Kerr-Schild higher spin fields we have used earlier naturally package
into a simple expression involving an arbitrary function, when the continuous
spin scale $\rho$ is set to zero. Further, we discuss the case of an anti-de
Sitter background, where there is also a vector space formalism given by Segal
and we clarify this approach using a different definition of the covariant
derivative. We give a general solution of Kerr-Schild type and finally we
describe some of the obstacles to a continuous spin formulation.

*A. P. B. Scarpelli,A. R. Vieira*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that a certain non-minimal dimension-5 Lorentz-violating term in QED doesn’t affect gauge symmetry at one-loop level and shows how an induced photon term arises from fermion contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the preservation of gauge invariance in extended QED models, which is crucial for maintaining consistency in quantum field theories with Lorentz violation.

Method: The authors analyze the one-loop corrections to the QED two- and three-point functions, compute the corresponding Ward identities, and derive conditions ensuring gauge invariance.

Result: Gauge invariance is preserved if the non-minimal Lorentz-violating fermion parameter adheres to standard QED conditions, suggesting minimal interaction is maintained. Additionally, the fermion's $a^{(5)}_F$ term induces a photon term in the photon sector through radiative effects.

Conclusion: The study confirms that despite Lorentz violation, the framework remains consistent with gauge invariance under specific conditions and reveals indirect photon term generation from fermionic contributions.

Abstract: In this work, we derive the conditions that assure gauge invariance of a
non-minimal dimension-5 Lorentz-violating QED. The two and three point
functions at one-loop are computed. The gauge Ward identities are checked and
the conditions to assure gauge symmetry of this non-minimal framework is found
to be the same of the usual QED. Induced terms are also investigated and it is
shown that the non-minimal Lorentz-violating $a^{(5)}_F$-term of the fermion
sector can induce radiatively a non-minimal Lorentz-violating term in the
photon sector.

Abstract: We focus on the use of the functional Wilsonian renormalization group
framework characterized by a proper time regulator and test its use in the
search of the scaling solutions and the critical properties of an
O(N)-invariant scalar field multiplet coupled to gravity in d=4 and d=3
dimensions. We employ the same background-fluctuation splitting and gauge
fixing procedure, already adopted in a previous study based, instead, on the
effective average action framework and a similar truncation of the effective
action. Our main goal is to compare the results for the scaling solutions and
some of the associated critical exponents. In this analysis, performed in a
different framework, most of the picture previously uncovered is confirmed both
at qualitative and quantitative level. There are, neverthelss, few differences
both at finite N and in its large value limit, depending also on the schemes
which in both frameworks are called 'improved'
