Since\nno current is shunted by antiferromagnetic insulators and the N\\'eel order does\nnot rely on single-crystalline materials, these results may provide a\nCMOS-compatible solution for constructing energy-efficient field-free\nspintronic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5782\u76f4\u5f00\u5173\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\uff08\u03c3_z\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u573a\u81ea\u65cb\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u5668\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u65e0\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5207\u6362\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u90bb\u6297\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u7684N\u00e9el\u6709\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u03c3_z\u81ea\u65cb\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u5c42\u81ea\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u03c3_z\u81ea\u65cb\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u8865\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We begin analyzing the higher-order gauge sector, where we\nfind the modes and the polarizations vectors associated to a massive photon and\nghost field. The higher-order gauge model is canonically quantized and as\nexpected the resulting algebra of creation and annihilation operators\ncorresponds to an indefinite metric in Hilbert space. Subsequently, we compute\nall relevant one-loop diagrams in the modified QED starting with the fermion\nself-energy. We show that the induced corrections to the fermion two-point\nfunction produce two independent fermionic degrees of freedom, which can be\nincluded in a redefined Lagrangian describing two decoupled fermions fields,\none corresponding to a physical particle and the other to a negative-norm ghost\nstate. We take advantage of this decomposition to compute the photon\npolarization operator and the vertex correction, both of which are found to be\nfinite.

The singular behaviour of thermodynamic quantities at the\ntransition, in particular, is determined by critical exponents of the\nuniversality class of the transition. However, critical properties are also\ncharacterised by the probability distribution of order parameter across the\ntransition, where non-Gaussian statistics are expected, but remain largely\nunexplored. Here, making use of single-atom-resolved detection in momentum\nspace, we measure the full probability distribution of the amplitude of the\norder parameter across a continuous phase transition in an interacting lattice\nBose gas. We find that fluctuations are captured by an effective potential --\nreconstructed from the measured probability distribution by analogy with Landau\ntheory -- displaying a non-trivial minimum in the superfluid (ordered) phase,\nwhich vanishes at the transition point. Additionally, we observe non-Gaussian\nstatistics of the order parameter near the transition, distinguished by\nnon-zero and oscillating high-order cumulants.

We argue that this model can be relevant to\nrealistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main\neffect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly\nattractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The\nnature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum\ngeometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is\nso. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes,\nwhose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap\nbetween the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular\nmomentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different\ntopology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the\nattractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational\nupper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds.

Watch a 4-minute video abstract\n  here: https://youtu.be/stYAA9BwJj8", "summary": "Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula\nare known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the\nso-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently\nthe set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those\nsame inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant\nHubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has\naccumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this\nconjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that\na given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to\nevaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly,\n\\emph{only} RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new\nevidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new\ncharacterization of that cone.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores whether the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) and Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) entropy cones coincide by introducing a new test involving Markov states. It concludes that the RT inequalities uniquely pass this test, supporting their coincidence with the HRT cone.-utilizes the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the HRT formula, and methodically evaluates the RT inequalities against a proposed test.-New evidence is provided that the RT and HRT cones are the same, along with a novel characterization of the entropy cone. This increases confidence in their equivalence in the HRT framework.", "motivation": "Understanding the relationship between the RT and HRT entropy cones is a key problem in holographic entanglement entropy. Previous evidence suggests they might be equivalent, but a new framework is needed to confirm this. By introducing a simple test using Markov states, the paper offers a fresh approach to this fundamental issue in quantum gravity and entanglement theory. This work could advance our understanding of holographic entanglement entropy and the structure of quantum spacetime.", "method": "The paper employs entanglement entropy calculations using the Ryu-Takayanagi and Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formulas. It introduces a new test involving Markov states, which simplifies the evaluation of RT inequalities. Through this method, the paper systematically determines whether RT inequalities pass the test, providing new evidence for their equivalence with the HRT cone.", "result": "The study finds that the RT inequalities pass the new test, and only the RT inequalities do so. This provides strong new evidence that the RT and HRT entropy cones are identical. Additionally, the results offer a completely new characterization of the entropy cone, which could lead to further insights into the nature of entanglement entropy and holography. These findings are significant because they confirm a key aspect of the holographic principle and could have implications for quantum gravity research.", "conclusion": "This paper makes a substantial contribution to the understanding of entanglement entropy cones. By introducing a novel test, it provides strong evidence that the RT and HRT entropy cones are the same. The results also offer a new perspective on the structure of the entropy cone, enriching our understanding of the underlying physics and potentially opening new avenues for research in this area."}}

Nevertheless, laser\nbistability with abrupt transitions has been reported in some laser systems,\nbut its underlying mechanism has never been explored. Here we study\nexperimentally and theoretically a novel nonlinearly self-coupled laser system.\nWe show both experimentally and theoretically that this system experiences\nspontaneous cascading that yields an abrupt mixed-order transition. At the\ncritical point, a long-lived cascading plateau is observed, characterized by a\ncritical branching factor equal to one.

Pure theoretical analysis\nindicates that the leading order effect of the gravitational constant variation\ncorrects the amplitude of gravitational waves, and the second order effect\ncorrects the phase of gravitational waves. As the matched filtering technique\nis used by gravitational wave data analysis, the phase is more important than\nthe amplitude. In the current paper we use LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA data to constrain\nthe gravitational constant variation. Our findings indicate that we need to\nwait until the distance of the detected gravitational wave events and/or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio increases by $2n$ orders compared to the current\ndetection state, and then we can use phase correction to get constraint\n$|\\frac{G'}{G}|<10^{-n}$/yr for gravitational wave events without\nelectromagnetic counterparts. For gravitational wave events with\nelectromagnetic counterparts which provide the information of source's\nluminosity distance, the phase correction can almost always be neglected to\nconstrain

While both are omnipresent in real\nmaterials, their individual impacts on charge transport remain elusive. To\ndisentangle their respective roles, we have independently varied the degree of\nrandomness and the strength of electronic correlations -- by chemical\nsubstitution and physical pressure, respectively -- within the metallic phase\nnearby a Mott-insulating state. We find a distinct correlation dependence of\nthe disorder-dependent residual resistivity $\\rho_0$ in the Fermi-liquid regime\n$\\rho(T)=\\rho_0 + A T^2$, where $A\\propto (m^{\\star}/m)^2$ quantifies the\nelectronic mass enhancement.

Accordingly, the Schmidt\ndecomposition theorem can be applied to each molecular ansatz to find a much\nshorter representation in terms of Schmidt basis and to estimate the\nentanglement content through the calculation of von Neumann entropies. Although\nhere we justify that the ground BO vibronic state of any molecule may be\nregarded as an almost separable and non-entangled state, this property worsens\nwith the vibrational excitation, which increases the entanglement\nmonotonically. The interlace between electronic and nuclear wave functions for\neach vibronic state becomes even more critical for those electronic excited\nstates whose electronic wave functions change drastically with the molecular\ngeometry.

With these results we open a new\nfield of experimental investigations of QFPT processes with potential future\nrelevance to quantum search algorithms, unraveling connections between\nclassical and quantum dynamics, and study of the quantum measurement problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5355\u79bb\u5b50 traps \u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9996\u6b21\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u957f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u590d\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u6fc0\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u9996\u6b21\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u957f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u7ecf\u5178\u5bf9\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u6fc0\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8c03\u5236\u95ea\u53d8\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5355\u79bb\u5b50\u52a8\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u80fd\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u9996\u6b21\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u957f\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u9996\u6b21\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u957f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u9996\u6b21\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u957f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u9996\u6b21\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u957f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
