The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian."}

This weighted count, which we call the mass, can be interpreted as the renormalized partition function of TQFT gravity. For Abelian TQFTs, the mass formula for topological boundary conditions reduces to the mass formula for particular families of codes. Focusing on the Abelian case, we show how to evaluate the mass for any bosonic theory and consider many explicit examples. We then discuss the non-Abelian generalization and compute the mass for $n + \\bar n$ copies of the Ising modular tensor category.

These two functions cannot be independently tuned in conventional engineering materials with linear or hyperelasticity. Ligaments achieve this balance through a highly nonlinear tensile response characterized by a J-shaped curve, featuring an extended \"toe region\" of low force up to intermediate strains followed by an inflection, called the \"heel region\" which marks the onset of nonlinear stiffening. Here, we present a framework for characterizing the defining features of J-curve behavior. Based on these features, we define measures for protectiveness and mobility to quantitatively describe the effective stiffness and the level of nonlinearity, thereby elucidating how the J-curve enables decoupled fine-tuning of flexibility and damage protection. A simplified mathematical model, supported by experimental validation, reveals the performance advantages of J-curve materials in antagonistic arrangements and highlights their unique design space compared with linear elastic systems. Furthermore, we develop synthetic J-curve materials capable of self-strain sensing via piezoresistive transduction, enabling their integration into practical devices. Collectively, these materials, models, and insights advance the understanding of nonlinear mechanical mechanisms in natural systems and provide a foundation for harnessing J-curve behavior in engineering applications such as bio-inspired robots."}

Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF.

However, ensuring the correctness of these libraries remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of mature testing methodologies. The state-of-the-art tools often rely on domain-specific configurations and expert knowledge, which limits their accessibility and scalability in practice. Furthermore, although these tools demonstrate strong performance, they adopt measurement-based for output validation in testing, which makes them produce false positive reports.\n  To alleviate these limitations, we propose QSPE, a practical approach that follows the differential testing principle and extends the existing approach, SPE, for quantum libraries. QSPE is fully automated, requiring no pre-set configurations or domain expertise, and can effectively generate a large set of diverse program variants that comprehensively explore the quantum compilation space. To mitigate the possible false positive reports, we propose statevector-based validation as an alternative to measurement-based validation. In our experiments, the QSPE approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in generating 22,770 program variants across multiple quantum computing platforms. By avoiding $α$-equivalence at the quantum and classical program wise, QSPE can reduce redundant generation and save more than 90\\% of execution cost. Finally, the statevector-based validation method assists QSPE to reduce false alarms and effectively detects 708 miscompilations across multiple quantum libraries. Notably, 81 of the discovered bugs have been officially approved and acknowledged by the Qiskit development team, demonstrating the practical impact of our approach."}

We validate this approach across three distinct response network topologies, namely (i) a pair of coupled neurons, (ii) a monolayer network of N coupled neurons and (iii) a two-layer multiplex network each composed of FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal units. The response networks inherently exhibit extreme events. Our results demonstrate that influencing just one neuron in the response network with an appropriately tuned driving signal is sufficient to control extreme events across all three configurations. In the two-neuron case, suppression of extreme events occurs due to the breaking of phase-locking between the driving neuron and the targeted response neuron. In the case of monolayer and multiplex networks, suppression of extreme events results from the disruption of protoevent frequency dynamics and a subsequent frequency decoupling of the driven neuron from the rest of the network. We also observe that when the size of the neurons in response network connected to the drive increases, the onset of control occurs earlier indicating a scaling advantage of the method."}

Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables."}

This robustness indicates that essential features of boundary physics on hyperbolic lattices, which capture aspects of AdS/CFT-like dualities in discrete systems, can be reproduced both experimentally and numerically without requiring perfectly hyperbolic lattices, thereby reducing the system size needed for implementation."}

Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings.

Using full 3D simulations in cylindrical coordinates, combined with a semi-analytical energy analysis, we show that the vortex preferentially splits along the long axis of the trap, a direction that minimizes the kinetic-energy cost relative to the initial TQV state. Systematic parameter scans reveal that initial quantum fluctuations increase the splitting time and suppress the transient three-core pattern observed in noise-free simulations, whereas stronger nonlinear interactions accelerate the splitting. When the trap is nearly isotropic, the unstable Bogoliubov modes are dominated by both azimuthal quantum number $l_q=3$ and $l_q=2$; this leads to a dynamical sequence where three daughter vortices first form a triangular arrangement, later evolving into a linear chain. For stronger anisotropy, geometric coupling selectively enhances the $l_q=2$ mode, making it the sole dominant channel and resulting directly in linear vortex alignment -- a clear signature of geometry-induced mode competition explained through combined energy-based and Bogoliubov stability analysis. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how trap geometry can steer the instability pathway, splitting time, and final pattern of a multiply quantized vortex, offering a route toward geometry-controlled vortex engineering."}

However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.\n  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints."}

It is fundamentally more general and applies to both particle- and wave-based descriptions of phonons, provided the transmission function is well defined. In the harmonic regime, the phonon transmission function and the resulting Landauer expression for heat current are exact. They can be rigorously derived using the atomistic Green's function method, which treats phonons as waves and does not require phonon dispersion in the interface region. In short, the Landauer framework remains valid for ideal, disordered, and defective interfaces, as long as an appropriate transmission function is used."}

The method was previously introduced as a tamper detection method for authenticating a single radiation detector in nuclear safeguards and treaty verification scenarios, and works by randomly sampling detector configuration parameters to produce a sequence of spectra that form a baseline signature of an untampered system. At a later date, after potential tampering, the same random sequence of parameters is used to generate another series of spectra that can be compared against the baseline. Anomalies in the series of comparisons indicate changes in detector behavior, which may be due to tampering. One limitation of this original method is that once the detector has `gone downrange' and may have been tampered with, the original baseline is fixed, and a new trusted baseline can never be established if tests at new parameters are required. In this work, we extend our anti-tamper fuzz testing concept to multiple detector units, such that the downrange detector can be compared against a trusted or `golden copy' detector, even despite normal inter-detector manufacturing variations. We show using three NaI detectors that this inter-detector differential fuzz testing can detect a representative attack, even when the tested and golden copy detectors are from different manufacturers and have different performances. Here, detecting tampering requires visualizing the comparison metric vs. the parameter values and not just the sample number; moreover this baseline is non-linear and may require anomaly detection methods more complex than a simple threshold. Overall, this extension to multiple detectors improves prospects for operationalizing the technique in real-world treaty verification and safeguards contexts."}

In this study, we investigate how local flows within the networks branch channels interact to collectively govern the global oscillatory dynamics.We find that the measured flow fluxes at intersection nodes obey Kirchhoff's current law. Phase differences exist among the flows in different branches.At the microscopic scale, flow distribution exhibits only brief periods of traffic congestion, which are resolved by the oscillatory flows. By mapping the flow flux vectors onto the magnetic moment vector of spin ice model, we demonstrate that the flow vectors strictly obey the ice-rule of vertex models in statistical physics.Notably, the three branches converging at a Y-shaped node never become blocked simultaneously, thereby preventing traffic congestion and ensuring efficient transmission of nutrients and signals.This intelligent flow control phenomenon offers novel insights for addressing traffic congestion and advances our understanding of frustrated quantum magnetism."}

According to his proposal, the gravitational field equations are the consequence of the first law of thermodynamics applied, locally, to a Rindler observer. Together with the dynamical laws of black holes, Jacobson's approach has become a very strong piece of evidence supporting the intimate connection between gravity, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. Jacobson's approach being formulated for Riemannian geometries, we have wondered what its consequences would be for non-Riemannian geometries, i.e., those that involve torsion, non metricity, or both. The results of our quest have been particularly appealing: we have found that the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action, arguably ``the simplest one'', does not belong to the pool of gravitational theories available for Nature's selection (except in the Riemannian case). In the search of a unique alternative, we have also considered the hypotheses employed in the formulation of the Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity. Together, the two approaches point towards the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a term quadratic in the torsion vector as the one that would be selected by Nature in the non-Riemannian case without non metricity. The same strategy cannot be followed in the full non-Riemannian case as the two approaches are mutually inconsistent."}

However, conventional semiconductor and ion-doped amplifiers suffer from limited gain bandwidths set by fixed energy levels, while optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) operating continuously from the visible to the NIR have remained elusive due to dispersion-limited bandwidth and the high pump powers required in the visible or ultraviolet (UV). Here, we overcome these limitations by introducing an electrically reconfigurable OPA architecture on lithium niobate integrated photonics. By synergistically combining ultra-high effective $χ^{(2)}$ nonlinearity ($\\sim$7,000\\%/W-cm$^2$), high-order dispersion engineering, and local electro-thermal tuning of quasi-phase matching, our device achieves record gain spectral spanning more than an optical octave, from 770 to 1650 nm. This range covers key transitions of many photonic quantum systems and all telecommunication bands. Moreover, our approach eliminates the need for high-power, wavelength-tunable visible or UV pumps, delivering a peak on-chip gain of 23.67 dB with a single 1060 nm pump at 90 mW average on-chip power. This work opens new avenues for multi-functional, reconfigurable photonics unifying the visible and infrared regimes, with broad implications for quantum sensing and communications."}

Within this formalism, we identify practical regimes that exhibit orders of magnitude reduced losses and improved phase accuracy compared to previous implementations. The model's validity is established through direct comparison with exact numerical solutions of the Schrödinger equation and through quantitative agreement with recent experimental benchmark results.

We compute the static tidal response of unspinning charged black holes at arbitrary radius, using the perturbative formalism developed in 2501.18684. Since the gravitational and electromagnetic tidal responses mix, we generalize the notion of Love numbers to Love matrices. We derive the coupled equations of motion for the metric and electromagnetic fluctuations around purely electric and magnetic backgrounds. For large charged black holes, which are described by the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity, we compute the full set of Love matrices induced by an arbitrary tower of $F^{2n}$ operators. We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime. These results imply that nearly-extremal magnetic black holes charged under an Abelian dark sector could be probed by gravitational-wave observations."}

The accuracy of this sensing, for small numbers of molecules, is limited by shot noise. Corresponding theoretical limits on sensing precision, as a function of sensing duration, have been well-studied in the context of quasi-static and randomly fluctuating concentrations. However, during development and in many other cases, concentration profiles are not random but exhibit predictable spatiotemporal patterns. We propose that leveraging prior knowledge of these structured profiles can improve and accelerate concentration sensing by utilizing information from current molecular binding events to predict future concentrations. By framing the constrained sensing problem as Bayesian inference over an allowed class of spatiotemporal profiles, we derive new theoretical limits on sensing accuracy. Our analysis reveals that maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation can outperform the classical Berg-Purcell and maximum-likelihood (Poisson counting) limits, achieving a sensing precision of $δc/c = 1/\\sqrt{a^2N}$, where $N$ is the number of binding events, and $a > 1$ in certain cases. Thus knowledge of the statistical structure of concentration profiles enhances sensing precision, providing a potential explanation for the rapid yet highly accurate cell fate decisions observed during development."}

These errors are significantly higher at smaller source-detector separations in a reflectance mode of measurement. This minimizes their applicability in situations where large area detection is used and also when signal depth is varying.

Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications."}

In a separate vein, linearized CC methods have drawn interest for their lower computational cost, increased parallelizability, and favorable properties for extension to the excited state--but the inclusion of ring/crossed-ring terms causes singularities even for single bond breaking. A linearized, addition-by-subtraction CC method called linearized ladder CCD (linLCCD) removes these terms to avoid divergences, but linLCCD under-estimates dynamical correlation. Herein we resolve this deficiency of linLCCD by introducing a linearized external coupled cluster perturbation theory that adds a second-order ring/crossed-ring correction back into a linLCCD reference wave function. Our resultant xlinCCD(2) method is regular and yields comparable results to linearized CCD in weakly-correlated regimes."}

Our approach goes beyond commonly used models that represent distinguishability via additional noninterfering modes and captures genuine multiphoton interference effects induced by the overlap of the internal state of the photons. This description provides a clear physical account of how distinguishability gives rise to effective noise in Gaussian boson sampling protocols while enabling a systematic investigation of phase effects arising from the overlap of the internal states."}

The approach, however, does not consider the action of the flow on the cell complex. The procedure is here extended to take this fundamental property into account, as done with templates. The goal is achieved endowing the cell complex with a directed graph that prescribes the flow direction between its highest dimensional cells. The tandem of cell complex and directed graph, baptized templex, is shown to allow for a sophisticated characterization of chaotic attractors and for an accurate classification of them. The cases of a few well-known chaotic attractors are investigated -- namely the spiral and funnel Rössler attractors, the Lorenz attractor and the Burke and Shaw attractor.

As a decisive factor of the confinement effect, the size of nanocapillary significantly affects the critical crystallization pressure and crystalline structure, especially for multi-layered ices. By choosing square ice as a typical two-dimensional (2D) multi-layered ice pattern and using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we further unveil the variation mechanism of critical crystallization pressure with the nanocapillary size. The results show a strong dependence of the critical crystallization pressure on the size of the graphene sheet for monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer square ice. The quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure, the actual pressure of water molecules, and the freezable region between them are all strongly dependent on the nanocapillary width. As the size of the capillary becomes larger in all three directions, the critical crystallization pressure converges to the true macroscopic crystallization pressure, which is very close to the value of the crystallization pressure for bulk ice. A direct correlation is established between 2D square ice and three-dimensional (3D) bulk ice by the critical crystallization pressure. There is an unfreezable threshold for crystallizing spontaneously in practice when the quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure is equal to the actual pressure, which can explain the limit of nanocapillary width for multi-layered ice."}

For class A in two spatial dimensions, we find a general inequality linking the Floquet quantum metric tensor and the Floquet topology: the associated quantum volume is bounded below by the Floquet topological invariant. This relation is found to also hold in class AIII in one dimension, where the Floquet geometric tensor may be notably reduced due to time-reflection symmetry. This work will be useful in digesting the general aspects of quantum geometry in periodically driven systems in connection with their topological characterization."}

Using energy-directed molecular docking via HADDOCK3 and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that favorable binding partners exhibit emergent, low-entropy N-states (discrete macrostates in NIS state space) indicative of preferential apolar/charged surface configurations. Across dozens of peptides and multiple receptor systems (WW, PDZ, and MDM2 domains), dominant N-states persisted under varied docking parameters and initial conditions. An experimental meta-ensemble of WW domains from 36 high-resolution structures confirmed the presence of dominant NIS modes independent of in silico methodology, suggesting an evolutionary selection pressure toward specific NIS fingerprints. These findings establish PSI entropy as a thermoinformatic descriptor that encodes favorable binding constraints into unique statistical signatures of the NIS."}

A new trace formulation provides a closed-form rotational average of anisotropic Raman tensors, which are not equivalent to isotropic molecules because of tensor nonlinearity. Optimized silver and Si3N4 devices show that lengthscale constraints are sufficient to suppress designs that rely on unphysical mathematical field divergences at sharp corners. Metallic designs deliver broadband enhancement and remain robust to typical Raman shifts, whereas dielectric designs yield narrower, quality-factor-limited gains that are inferior to metallic designs for quality factors below about 500.

We show that, in rotating binary condensates, quantized vortices in one component form hollow channels that act as self-induced weak links for the other, enabling superflow through otherwise impenetrable, phase-separated domains. This introduces a novel barrier mechanism: quantum pressure creates an effective barrier inside the vortex channel, set by the constriction width, which controls the superflow. Tuning the interspecies interaction strength drives a crossover from the hydrodynamic transport to Josephson tunneling regime. Long-range dipolar interactions further tune the weak-link properties, enabling both short links and two coupled junctions in series. Circuit models quantitatively capture the dc current-phase relations for both configurations. These results establish vortices as reconfigurable, interaction-controlled Josephson elements in superfluids."}

These errors are significantly higher at smaller source-detector separations in a reflectance mode of measurement. This minimizes their applicability in situations where large area detection is used and also when signal depth is varying. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we derive two distance- and property-dependent DPF models one ideal and one experimentally practical and benchmark them against standard formulations.

In this study, we propose a hybrid approach utilizing a quantum computing-based optimization algorithm integrated with classical pre-processing to expedite the genome assembly process. Specifically, we present a method to solve the Hamiltonian and Eulerian paths within the genome assembly graph using gate-based quantum computing through a Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulation with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm (VQE), in addition to a novel bitstring recovery mechanism to improve optimizer traversal of the solution space.

Molecular dynamics simulations of the methaniminium cation on the S$_1$ surface confirm this prediction: trajectories can approach regions with small adiabatic gaps, but never reach the CI seam, even if the CI corresponds to a region of lowest potential energy.

One such pattern appears in the frontal aspect ratio. Smaller animals like insects typically adopt a landscape frontal aspect ratio, with a wider side-to-side base of support than center of mass height. Larger animals like elephants, however, are taller than wide with a portrait aspect ratio. Known explanations for postural scaling are restricted to animal groups with similar anatomical and behavioural motifs, but the trend in frontal aspect ratio transcends such commonalities. Here we show that vertebrates and invertebrates with diverse body plans, ranging in mass from 28 mg to 22000 kg, exhibit size-dependent scaling of the frontal aspect ratio driven by the need for lateral stability on uneven natural terrain. Because natural terrain exhibit scale-dependent unevenness, and the frontal aspect ratio is important for lateral stability during locomotion, smaller animals need a wider aspect ratio for stability. This prediction is based on the fractal property of natural terrain unevenness, requires no anatomical or behavioural parameters, and agrees with the measured scaling despite vast anatomical and behavioural differences. Furthermore, a statistical phylogenetic comparative analysis found that shared ancestry and random trait evolution cannot explain the measured scaling. Thus, our findings reveal that terrain roughness, acting through natural selection for stability, likely drove the macroevolution of frontal shape in terrestrial animals."}

We demonstrate the recording of extracellular action potentials from cardiomyocytes with single-cell resolution and a high sensitivity of 3 μV, which compares favorably to the previous record for any ECORE setup. Combining ECORE with microscopy simplifies the optical setup, allows for the simultaneous imaging of specimens, and makes ECORE accessible to a broader community of researchers, allowing for a better understanding of the biological processes that are integral to life."}

In this regime the only principal difference between the collisions with these atomic systems lies in the masses of their positively charged constituents. We have shown that the corresponding mass effects strongly influence the spectra of the target fragments and the total cross sections. This influence manifests itself via i) the significantly smaller binding energy in positronium resulting in smaller momentum transfers necessary to break the system, ii) a strong constructive interference between the inelastic scattering of the projectile on the electron and the positron in collisions with positronium that also increases the chances for the breakup and iii) the \"passive\" role of the hydrogen nucleus caused by its heavy mass that prohibits hydrogen ionization to proceed via the interaction between the projectile and the nucleus."}

We derive an evolution equation for the moment generating function for this work, faithfully capturing the thermodynamic signature of coherent superpositions in the initial ensemble. We demonstrate that different initial ensembles that correspond to the same density matrix upon ensemble average, while having the same average work, display different work fluctuations. For monotonic driving, we show that fluctuations are maximum for coherence-less initial ensembles. As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs. We also obtain a generalized fluctuation theorem that establishes a new quantum lower bound on the mean dissipated work. This bound, counterintuitively, is also applicable to a \"classical\" initial ensemble with the same initial density matrix and is connected to quantum absolute irreversibility."}

Although traditional TS generation methods are computationally expensive, recent generative modeling approaches have enabled chemically meaningful TS prediction for relatively small molecules. However, these methods fail to generalize to practically relevant reaction substrates because of distribution shifts induced by increasing molecular sizes. Furthermore, TS geometries for larger molecules are not available at scale, making it infeasible to train generative models from scratch on such molecules. To address these challenges, we introduce FragmentFlow: a divide-and-conquer approach that trains a generative model to predict TS geometries for the reactive core atoms, which define the reaction mechanism. The full TS structure is then reconstructed by re-attaching substituent fragments to the predicted core. By operating on reactive cores, whose size and composition remain relatively invariant across molecular contexts, FragmentFlow mitigates distribution shifts in generative modeling. Evaluated on a new curated dataset of reactions involving reactants with up to 33 heavy atoms, FragmentFlow correctly identifies 90% of TSs while requiring 30% fewer saddle-point optimization steps than classical initialization schemes. These results point toward scalable TS generation for high-throughput reactivity studies."}

Their performance is, however, limited by radiation induced degradation of the gain layer, primarily driven by acceptor removal. This study presents a systematic comparison of how the degradation evolves with different incident proton energies, using LGADs from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and The Institute of Microelectronics of Barcelona (IMB-CNM) irradiated with 18 MeV, 24 MeV, 400 MeV and 23 GeV protons and fluences up to 2.5x10^15 p/cm2. Electrical characterization is used to extract the acceptor removal coefficients for different proton energies, whereas IR TCT measurements offer complementary insight into the gain evolution in LGADs after irradiation. Across all devices, lower energy protons induce stronger gain layer degradation, confirming expectations. However, 400 MeV protons consistently appear less damaging than both lower and higher energy protons, an unexpected deviation from a monotonic energy trend. Conversion of proton fluences to 1 MeV neutron-equivalent fluences reduces but does not eliminate these differences, indicating that the standard Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) scaling does not fully account for the underlying defect formation mechanisms at different energies and requires revision when considering irradiation fields that contain a broader spectrum of particle types and energies."}

These metabolites cycle between charged (high-energy) and uncharged (low-energy) states to mediate energy transfer. While distinct currency metabolites are associated with different metabolic functions, their charged and uncharged forms are generally interchangeable via biochemical reactions such as ${\\rm ATP{\\,+\\,}GDP{\\,\\rightleftharpoons\\,}ADP{\\,+\\,}GTP}$ and $\\rm NADP^+{\\,+\\,}NADH{\\,\\rightleftharpoons\\,}NADPH{\\,+\\,}NAD^+ $. Thus, their energetic states are generally coupled and influence each other, which would hinder the independent regulation of different currency metabolites. Despite the extensive knowledge of the molecular biology of individual currency metabolites, it remains poorly understood how the coordination of various coupled currency metabolites shapes metabolic regulation, efficiency, and ultimately the evolution of organisms. Here, we present a minimal theoretical model of metabolic currency coupling and reveal a fundamental tradeoff relationship between metabolic controllability and thermodynamic cost: increasing the capacity to independently regulate multiple currency metabolites generally requires comparable abundances of those metabolites, which in turn incurs a higher entropy production rate. The tradeoff suggests that in complex environments, organisms evolutionarily favor an equal abundance of currency metabolites to enhance metabolic controllability at the expense of a higher thermodynamic cost; conversely, in simple environments, organisms evolve to have imbalanced amounts of them to reduce heat dissipation. These considerations also offer a hypothesis regarding evolutionary trends in nucleotide-pool balance and genomic GC content."}

We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of caesium dimers correlated to 402P3/2 Rydberg states, with an emphasis on decay via autoionisation (associative ionisation). Our model includes a relativistic treatment of electron-atom scattering with spin-orbit coupling, the perturber's hyperfine structure, and coupling of vibrational levels to a continuum of short-range decay channels. Calculated potential-energy curves predict two families of wells: outer wells near the classical outer turning point supporting long-lived states, and inner wells at shorter range whose lifetimes are limited by tunneling and subsequent vibronic decay. Using photoassociation in an ultracold Cs gas and an analysis of pulsed-field-ionisation signals which are highly selective for the detection of molecules, we assign resonances by binding energy and measure lifetimes. The measured lifetimes of inner-well states increase systematically with increasing detuning and agree with calculated lifetimes; detection of Cs2+ product ions supports autoionisation as a dominant channel. We show that the lifetimes are strongly reduced by spin-orbit interactions in the transient Cs-collision complex, which lift the near-degeneracy in Omega observed for states in the outer well and control the inner-well binding. The identified states also provide promising pathways to create ultracold molecules in ion-pair states."}

We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs.

Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $χ(\\mathbf{q},ω)$.

To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q < 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q > 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works.

Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime."}

Furthermore, these spinning objects are slightly deformed and are no longer perfect spheres because of hydrostatic equilibrium. The well-known Kerr solution of the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) represents the spacetime surrounding a rotating spherical gravitational source. However, real objects deviate from a perfect sphere and may be prolate or oblate. There are several solutions of the EFE that represent the spacetime of deformed objects. The Kerr--like (KL) metric represents the spacetime surrounding this kind of object, where the deformation is characterized by the mass quadrupole moment parameter $q_{\\mathrm{KL}}$. When $q_{\\mathrm{KL}} \\neq 0$, the Carter constant no longer exists and the equations of motion (EOM) are no longer integrable; therefore, the system exhibits chaotic orbits. Another widely used solution is the Hartle--Thorne (HT) metric, which has similar characteristics and represents a slightly deformed, slowly rotating star. The HT metric has several versions, and two of them were selected to test their validity. The traditional HT version, which contains logarithmic terms, is less accurate than the version with exponential terms. Moreover, both the KL and HT metrics may be extended to include contributions due to the magnetic dipole moment of the source. The equations of motion (EOM) were computed, and these new dynamical systems display several interesting features, which are shown in their Poincar'e sections."}

However, the lack of robust polarization control has remained a critical obstacle to the deployment of gas-based fiber sources. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by demonstrating the generation of highly-polarized Stokes light via stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in a nitrogen-filled polarization-maintaining anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (PM-HCF). By exploiting the strong structural birefringence of the fiber, the Raman interaction becomes polarization-decoupled along the principal birefringence axes, leading to threshold-selective Raman amplification and an intrinsic polarization purification mechanism. As a result, the vibrational Raman Stokes emission exhibits a polarization extinction ratio (PER) of 35 dB, even when the incident pump PER is as low as ~2 dB. Through analytical theory and numerical modeling, we validate the underlying polarization-selective Raman dynamics and identify the fiber platform as the dominant factor governing the observed PER saturation. We further show that this high polarization purity and high conversion efficiency is maintained under tight bending conditions with radii down to 5 cm, in stark contrast to conventional non-PM-HCF. These results establish PM-HCFs as a robust and scalable architecture for generating polarization-stable, frequency-shifted light, and indicate that polarization may be treated as an actively engineerable degree of freedom in gas photonics, paving the way toward deployment-ready gas-based fiber sources for precision metrology, quantum communication, and coherent sensing."}

Uncertainties in the oscillator strengths of specific lines used for abundance analyses directly translate into uncertainties in the derived elemental abundances; incomplete or biased atomic data sets can impart significant errors in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modelling. Theoretical calculations of atomic data are therefore crucial to supplement the limited experimental results. In this work, we present extensive atomic data, including oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes for 1730 electric-dipole (E1) transitions among 107 levels in neutral sulphur (S I) using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic-configuration-interaction (RCI) methods.

The accuracy of the computed transition rates is assessed by combining the comparison of the differences in transition rates between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges with a cancellation-factor (CF) analysis. Approximately 16% of the ab initio results achieved an accuracy classification of A-B, corresponding to uncertainties within 10%, as defined by the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST ASD). Applying a fine-tuning technique was found to significantly improve the accuracy of the results in the Coulomb gauge, thereby improving the consistency between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges; about 24% of the fine-tuned transition data are assigned to the accuracy classes A-B."}

Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking."}

This distinction is well established in the presence of infrared effects, long-range correlations, and environmental interactions, and becomes particularly relevant in supersymmetric theories, where fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom are constrained at the algebraic level but need not share identical asymptotic behavior. In this work we introduce a minimal and predynamical localization criterion that distinguishes algebraically allowed degrees of freedom from those capable of forming stable, phasecoherent asymptotic states. The criterion is formulated in terms of long-time stability under slow structural fluctuations of an effective background, without modifying the underlying field equations or introducing new physical interactions. We show that fermionic and scalar fields respond qualitatively differently to such structural effects. While fermionic modes may retain asymptotic stability, scalar modes generically exhibit decoherence and damping, preventing their interpretation as localized one-particle states. This provides a conservative and model-independent perspective on how supersymmetric algebraic structures may coexist with an asymmetric observable particle spectrum. The analysis is intentionally non-constructive and does not rely on specific supersymmetrybreaking mechanisms, cosmological assumptions, or new dynamical ingredients. Rather, it clarifies localization as an independent structural requirement for particle existence within standard quantum field theory."}

This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions."}

We focus on the paradigmatic disordered spin-$1\\!/2$ XXZ chain and its impurity variant with local interactions. Across highly excited eigenstates, FAF evolves from typical-state behavior at weak disorder to strongly suppressed values deep in the MBL regime, with volume-law scaling in the XXZ chain and an area-law bound in the impurity setting. Rare long range catlike eigenstates exhibit a pronounced enhancement of FAF, making it a sensitive diagnostic of mechanisms proposed to destabilize MBL. Starting from product states, we find that in the MBL regime FAF grows slowly in time, approaching saturation via a power-law relaxation. Overall, our results show that MBL suppresses fermionic non-Gaussianity, and the associated complexity beyond free fermions, while ergodicity restores it, motivating explorations of fermionic non-Gaussianity in other ergodicity-breaking phenomena."}

For time-like geodesics, the maximum correction is the Planck length, which disappears when the classical separation vanishes. The light-like geodesics do not exhibit quantum corrections, meaning that the causal light cone remains the same in both classical and quantum frameworks under certain conditions.

Here, we overcome this limitation with a ring-shaped electrode architecture that suppresses field perturbations across a broad bandwidth from 2.0 to 5.0 THz. The resonant frequency of the ring electrode can be flexibly detuned from the target operation frequency by adjusting its inner and outer radii, while the smooth, edge-free geometry minimizes the lightning-rod effect. These design features collectively lead to a pronounced suppression of localized THz field enhancement. Numerical simulations reveal an 8.48x reduction in the local field strength compared with conventional rod-shaped electrodes. Consistent with this, experimental measurements on graphene-based detectors exhibit a 6.95x decrease in photocurrent for the ring-shaped electrode relative to the rod-shaped configuration. Moreover, the ring geometry effectively reduces the linear polarization ratio of the photocurrent from >3 to <1.4, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating electrode-induced polarization anisotropy.

The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in disordered systems such as the diffusion length and the localization length. However, in disordered systems with vanishing or nearly vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain what determines the important length scales in such systems. In this work, we use the 1D Lieb lattice with isolated flat bands as an example to show that the quantum metric length (QML) is a fundamental length scale in the ballistic, diffusive and localization regimes. The QML is defined through the Bloch state wave functions of the flat bands. In the ballistic regime with short junctions, the QML controls the finite energy transport properties. In the localization regime with long junctions, the localization length is determined by the QML and remarkably, independent of disorder strength over a wide range of disorder strength. We call this unconventional localization regime, the quantum metric localization regime. In the diffusive regime, we demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient is linearly proportional to the QML via the wave-packet dynamics numerically. Importantly, the numerical results are consistent with the analytical results obtained through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We conclude that the QML is a fundamentally important length scale governing the properties of disordered flat band materials."}

Possible violations could arise from quantum physics applied to gravity or the presence of vector and tensor fields mediating the gravitational interaction together with the metric tensor of General Relativity. We present our results in the latter case. We analyzed the orbit of the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites over a period of almost three decades. The effects of the possible preferred frame represented by the cosmic microwave background radiation on the mean argument of latitude of the satellites orbit were considered.

For Haar random two qubit unitaries, our techniques typically lead to non-trivial lower bounds. Further, we obtain lower bounds on most of the commonly studied two qubit quantum gates, including CNOT, DCNOT, $\\sqrt{\\text{SWAP}}$, and the XX interaction, none of which previously had known lower bounds.

Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $η$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. Our results establish a disorder-tolerant route to stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor via minimal local quantum-jump control."}

In the scenario of three physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation disrupts quantum steering, with the maximum steering asymmetry during the two-way steering to one-way steering transition precisely demarcating the phase boundary between these regimes.

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature.

Indeed, in previous studies based on the PSSY model, which incorporates only the topological degrees of freedom of gravity, it was shown that when the error is sufficiently large, a violation of causality can arise, as indicated by a nonvanishing mutual information. In this paper, we investigate the situation in which dynamical gravity also acts on the Hawking radiation. In this case, operations on the Hawking radiation induce nontrivial backreaction on the bulk spacetime appearing in the gravitational path integral for the mutual information -- an effect that is absent when the Hawking radiation is non-gravitating.

The nonlinear magnon polariton dynamics empowered by this new parametric platform brings both verified true randomness and robust multi-channel correlations, from which we construct a microwave communication experiment for noise resilient signal transmission with added security. This work establishes cavity magnonics as a versatile and compact platform for generating correlated multi-mode microwave signals, opening new avenues for applications in classical and quantum domains."}

Here, based on group theory analysis, we present a scheme for rapidly identifying the Weyl-Dirac nodal lines (a complex of Weyl and Dirac nodal lines) in bosonic systems. We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features. Our work provides an insight for exploring and leveraging topological properties in systems with coexisting multiple topological states."}

A rigorous method, based on Grassmann variables and coherent states, is constructed to obtain a closed-form expression for the fermionic star-exponential from its associated propagator. As a primary application, a fermionic version of the Feynman-Kac formula is derived within this formalism, allowing for the calculation of the ground state energy directly in phase space.

This transition is accompanied by gate-tunable spin currents of Edelstein and spin Hall type, whose behavior reflects the underlying electron wavefunction interference. Notably, the Edelstein current shows an inflection point at the critical Rashba strength, signaling the crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field we also report a transition in angular periodicity of the magnetoresistance -- from $π$ to $2π$ -- arising from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman coupling.

EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise.

In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics."}

We demonstrate that it can by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle--hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, a locally transformed $η$-pair lowering operator, on as little as a single lattice site, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with macroscopic $η$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $η$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO.

Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \\to \\infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point. This work establishes multi-partite entanglement as a powerful probe of quantum topological phase transitions in strongly coupled topological systems."}

The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean. This formulation reorganises Krylov complexity into a dynamical field-theoretic framework and identifies new fluctuation diagnostics of operator growth in closed quantum systems."}

By contrast, the dynamics of the full system-environment compound is governed by the underlying Hamiltonian spectrum, where bound states in the continuum (BICs) can protect long-lived quantum resources. Despite these parallel perspectives, the relation between LGC and BIC formation has remained largely unexplored. Here we bridge this gap in a paradigmatic giant-atom waveguide platform and show that the occurrence of LGC necessarily benchmarks the presence of a BIC in the full Hamiltonian description. By engineering the giant-atom geometry, we further demonstrate rich dynamical regimes-including Rabi oscillations, fractional decay, and complete exponential relaxation-depending on the number of supported BICs, which can be tuned from three to zero. Remarkably, when two BICs become frequency-degenerate, the long-time dynamics approaches a steady state rather than exhibiting persistent oscillations. Our results establish a direct spectral-dynamical connection between effective Markovian and underlying non-Markovian descriptions, and provide a route toward flexible control of open-system dynamics."}

Here, significantly enhanced spectral broadening induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) is experimentally demonstrated in silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides integrated with 2D monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films. Monolayer MoS2 films with ultrahigh optical nonlinearity are synthesized via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and subsequently transferred onto Si3N4 waveguides, with precise control of the film coating length and placement achieved by selectively opening windows on the chip silica upper cladding. Detailed SPM measurements at telecom wavelengths are performed using fabricated waveguides with various MoS2 film coating lengths. Compared to devices without MoS2, increased spectral broadening of sub-picosecond optical pulses is observed for the hybrid devices, achieving a broadening factor of up to ~ 2.4 for a device with a 1.4-mm-long MoS2 film. Theoretical fitting of the experimental results further reveals an increase of up to ~27 fold in the nonlinear parameter (γ) for the hybrid MoS2 / Si3N4 waveguides and an equivalent Kerr coefficient (n2) of MoS2 nearly 5 orders of magnitude higher than Si3N4.

Motivated by string-inspired effective field theories, we study the perturbative stability of the Cho-Maison monopole when the hypercharge kinetic term is regularised by a Born-Infeld extension, which renders the monopole energy finite. Focusing on the bosonic electroweak theory with an unmodified $SU(2)_L$ sector and a Born-Infeld U(1)_Y sector, we analyze linear fluctuations about the regularised monopole background. Using a complex tetrad and a spin-weighted harmonic decomposition, we reduce the fluctuation equations to coupled radial Schroedinger-type eigenvalue problems and examine the spectrum of the resulting operators. We extend the separation-of-variables framework developed by Gervalle and Volkov to this non-linear gauge-field setting. We show that, after appropriate gauge fixing and constraint elimination, the Born-Infeld deformation preserves the angular channel structure of the Maxwell theory and leads to a self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville type problem for the stability of the radial modes, with modified radial coefficients determined by the background Born-Infeld profile. The resulting operator represents a smooth deformation of the Maxwell case and retains positive kinetic weight. Our results provide plausible evidence for the stability of the Born-Infeld deformed monopole and, most importantly, a systematic framework for future numerical or variational studies aimed at a definitive spectral analysis."}

Under these conditions, the stationary continuity constraint induces a nonlinear amplitude equation of Ermakov Pinney type in each degree of freedom, revealing a hidden invariant structure that is independent of whether the evolution parameter is time or space.\n  By reformulating the separated stationary equations in Sturm Liouville form and applying Liouville normalization, we demonstrate that the quantum potential is encoded as a curvature contribution of the self adjoint operator rather than appearing as an additional dynamical term. This correspondence preserves the standard probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics while yielding exact stationary Bohmian amplitudes and their associated invariants. The resulting invariant-based formulation provides stationary guiding fields and clarifies the ontological status of Bohmian amplitudes as geometrically encoded structures rather than auxiliary dynamical additions.

Product formulas remain the workhorse of quantum simulation on near-term devices, yet standard error analyses yield worst-case bounds that can vastly overestimate the resources required for structured problems. For systems governed by geometrically local Hamiltonians with maximum entanglement entropy $S_\\text{max}$ across all bipartitions, we prove that the first-order Trotter error scales as $\\mathcal{O}(t^2 S_\\text{max} \\operatorname{polylog}(n)/r)$ rather than the worst-case $\\mathcal{O}(t^2 n/r)$, where $n$ is the system size and $r$ is the number of Trotter steps. This yields improvements of $\\tildeΩ(n^2)$ for one-dimensional area-law systems and $\\tildeΩ(n^{3/2})$ for two-dimensional systems. We extend these bounds to higher-order Suzuki formulas, where the improvement factor involves $2^{pS^*/2}$ for the $p$-th order formula. We further establish a separation result demonstrating that volume-law entangled systems fundamentally require $\\tildeΩ(n)$ more Trotter steps than area-law systems to achieve the same precision. This separation is tight up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis combines Lieb-Robinson bounds for locality, tensor network representations for entanglement structure, and novel commutator-entropy inequalities that bound the expectation value of nested commutators by the Schmidt rank of the state. These results have immediate applications to quantum chemistry, condensed matter simulation, and resource estimation for fault-tolerant quantum computing."}

However, the extreme miniaturization and high mechanical compliance that make graphene attractive also render it highly susceptible to nonlinearities, degrading frequency stability. Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators."}

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for intelligent routing, its practical deployment remains constrained by high energy consumption and decision latency. Here, we propose a photonic spiking RL architecture that implements a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based intelligent routing algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is systematically evaluated on a software-defined network (SDN) with a fat-tree topology. The results demonstrate that, under various baseline traffic rate conditions, the PPO-based routing strategy significantly outperforms the conventional Dijkstra algorithm in several key performance metrics. Furthermore, a hardware-software collaborative framework of the spiking Actor network is realized for three typical baseline traffic rates, utilizing a photonic synapse chip based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) array and a photonic spiking neuron chip based on distributed feedback lasers with a saturable absorber (DFB-SAs). Experimental validation on 640 state-action pairs shows that the inference accuracy of the hardware-software collaborative framework is consistent with that of the pure algorithmic implementation. The impacts of different hidden-layer scales in the spiking Actor network and varying network size of fat-tree topology are further analyzed. The integration of photonic spiking RL with SDN-based routing establishes a novel paradigm for intelligent routing optimization, featuring ultra-low latency and high energy efficiency. This approach exhibits broad application prospects in real-time network optimization scenarios, including large-scale data centers, computing networks, satellite Internet systems, and future 6G networks."}

However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.\n  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints."}

Among the most promising approaches, photoacoustic imaging achieves penetration into deep tissue but with coarse resolution, while fluorescence provides subcellular detail but is confined to shallow depths. This depth-resolution trade-off remains a central barrier to biomedical imaging. To bridge this fundamental gap, we present a hybrid dual-modal strategy that combines the benefits of photoacoustic and fluorescence modalities. Our approach leverages hybrid opto-acoustic feedback for wavefront shaping and computational imaging through scattering media. By combining these complementary signals into a nonlinear feedback metric, we achieve robust optical focusing even under signal degradation. In particular, we show that photoacoustic-guided wavefront shaping inherently generates fluorescence that can be harvested for computational high-resolution imaging even within highly scattering biological tissues, thereby leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities in a single framework. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate this synergistic approach, paving the way for optical imaging techniques that fully leverage the potential of such dual-modalities for large depth penetration and high resolution in complex biological tissues."}

In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian."}

We demonstrate that while MS-QRC performance is highly sensitive to the underlying dynamical phase of matter and decoherence, SS-QRC exhibits greater robustness. Using the randomized measurement toolbox to mitigate measurement overhead, we reveal that sampling noise undermines the convergence property required for MS-QRC. This leads to a significant reduction in the information processing capacity (IPC) of MS-QRC, deteriorating its performance on nonlinear time-series benchmarks. In contrast, SS-QRC maintains high IPC and accuracy across both temporal and non-temporal tasks. Our results suggest SS-QRC as a preferred candidate for near-term practical applications due to its resilience to system configurations and statistical noise."}

Since the gravitational and electromagnetic tidal responses mix, we generalize the notion of Love numbers to Love matrices. We derive the coupled equations of motion for the metric and electromagnetic fluctuations around purely electric and magnetic backgrounds. For large charged black holes, which are described by the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity, we compute the full set of Love matrices induced by an arbitrary tower of $F^{2n}$ operators. We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime.

We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the fidelity probe near the Dirac EP, highlighting the critical role of parameter directionality in exploiting Dirac EPs for quantum control and sensing applications."}

Our result for the vacuum energy describes a black hole surrounded by a finite volume of photons at $T_{H} = \\frac{1}{8πG M}$, the black hole quantum atmosphere. The total entropy includes contributions from this atmosphere, and the Bekenstein entropy, which arises from the Gibbons--Hawking--York boundary term, which encodes topological information. We show that the contribution of the quantum atmosphere to the black hole specific heat is positive, indicating that the system may become thermodynamically stable.\n  By analyzing homology groups, we show that the black hole evaporation is a tunneling between topologically distinct spacetimes: Schwarzschild ($χ= 2)$ transitions to the flat spacetime ($χ= 1$) via Hawking radiation, where $χ$ is the Euler characteristic, a topological invariant. This process resembles instanton-driven tunneling in Yang-Mills theories, where topologically non-trivial solutions dominate the vacuum amplitude. In our case, the Gibbons--Hawking--York term dominates the transition amplitude, which induces the evaporation process.

This distinction is well established in the presence of infrared effects, long-range correlations, and environmental interactions, and becomes particularly relevant in supersymmetric theories, where fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom are constrained at the algebraic level but need not share identical asymptotic behavior. In this work we introduce a minimal and predynamical localization criterion that distinguishes algebraically allowed degrees of freedom from those capable of forming stable, phasecoherent asymptotic states. The criterion is formulated in terms of long-time stability under slow structural fluctuations of an effective background, without modifying the underlying field equations or introducing new physical interactions. We show that fermionic and scalar fields respond qualitatively differently to such structural effects. While fermionic modes may retain asymptotic stability, scalar modes generically exhibit decoherence and damping, preventing their interpretation as localized one-particle states. This provides a conservative and model-independent perspective on how supersymmetric algebraic structures may coexist with an asymmetric observable particle spectrum. The analysis is intentionally non-constructive and does not rely on specific supersymmetrybreaking mechanisms, cosmological assumptions, or new dynamical ingredients. Rather, it clarifies localization as an independent structural requirement for particle existence within standard quantum field theory."}

Four modulation cases are analyzed: instantaneous modulation, synchronous modulation, and the Stokes and anti-Stokes resonances. For these cases, simple expressions are obtained for the carrier and sideband transmission and reflection powers as well as for the total gain and loss powers. Although the achievable total gain remains small for realistic modulation and waveguide parameters, the anti-Stokes resonance is identified as the most promising condition for observing modulation-induced light amplification."}

Recent work on optical skyrmions offers a route to overcoming these limitations by exploiting perturbation-resilient topological invariants assigned to the optical field for computation. However, owing to its relative novelty, an architectural perspective on integrating individual components that manipulate topological charge into a functional system remains an important open goal. In this paper, we take concrete steps toward system-level design by introducing a platform-independent architecture for skyrmion-based logic, built around a modular library of topologically robust optical primitives, including generators, converters, registers, and adders. This framework enables the synthesis and arithmetic manipulation of topological numbers within a unified programmable architecture. We then experimentally validate this approach using multichannel arrays, demonstrating accurate charge readout and high robustness against alignment errors and environmental noise. These results provide a scalable foundation for topologically robust programmable logic arrays, paving the way for compact and integrated photonic processing circuits."}

Here, we theoretically investigate the quantum geometry of Dirac EPs realized in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, utilizing fidelity susceptibility as a probe. We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the fidelity probe near the Dirac EP, highlighting the critical role of parameter directionality in exploiting Dirac EPs for quantum control and sensing applications."}

But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings."}

Indeed, in previous studies based on the PSSY model, which incorporates only the topological degrees of freedom of gravity, it was shown that when the error is sufficiently large, a violation of causality can arise, as indicated by a nonvanishing mutual information. In this paper, we investigate the situation in which dynamical gravity also acts on the Hawking radiation. In this case, operations on the Hawking radiation induce nontrivial backreaction on the bulk spacetime appearing in the gravitational path integral for the mutual information -- an effect that is absent when the Hawking radiation is non-gravitating. We find that this backreaction renders the relevant mutual information vanishing. This result implies that, in theories with dynamical gravity, the apparent violation of causality is resolved."}

Here, we introduce a new degree of freedom to manipulate the birefringence of light propagation in optical crystals through programming the spatiotemporal spectral phase of the incident light wave. We demonstrate this approach achieves continuous tuning of birefringence across a spectrum more than 100 times broader than that achievable with conventional birefringence tuning, spanning from positive through zero to negative values, irrespective of the crystal's optical sign and without inherent physical limitations. This unique optical behavior provides a versatile platform for investigating the complex dynamics of wave flow in anisotropic media, while the broad tunability of this space-time birefringence will spur innovations in ultrafast optical manipulation, optical computation, and quantum information processing-applications that demand rapid and flexible device reconfiguration."}

A rigorous method, based on Grassmann variables and coherent states, is constructed to obtain a closed-form expression for the fermionic star-exponential from its associated propagator. As a primary application, a fermionic version of the Feynman-Kac formula is derived within this formalism, allowing for the calculation of the ground state energy directly in phase space.

Here, we present a sparse-sampling strategy for reconstructing high-resolution wide-field images from only a small number of measurements. Using simulated NV-ensemble detection of ac magnetic fields, we show that a mean-adjusted Bayesian estimation (MABE) framework can reconstruct 10000-pixel images from only 25 sampling points, achieving SSIM values exceeding 0.999 for representative smooth field distributions, while optimized dynamical-decoupling pulse sequences yield an approximately twofold improvement in magnetic-field sensitivity. The method further clarifies how sampling patterns and sampling density affect reconstruction accuracy and suggests a route toward faster and more scalable magnetic-imaging architectures that may extend to point-scanning NV sensors and other magnetometry platforms, such as SQUIDs, Hall probes, and magnetic tunnel junctions."}

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate.

The setup is made of two laser beams, one features an angular jitter that mimics the input beam as seen from the jittering bench under test (BUT), the other is aligned to the optical axis of the BUT and provides a phase reference for the jittering beam. The induced phase variations between both beams detected at the BUT's output pupil gives access to the TTL coupling. The ''TTL probe'' must feature a negligible residual TTL coupling which implies a micrometric accuracy in the centering of the setup pupil, the beams and the angular jitter associated pivot point.

In this work, we quantify the entrywise resolvability of the Hessian for Variational Quantum Algorithms at random initialization. By leveraging exact second-order parameter-shift rules, we derive a structural representation that reduces the variance of Hessian entries to a finite covariance quadratic form of shifted cost evaluations. This framework reveals two distinct scaling regimes that govern the sample complexity required to resolve Hessian entries against shot noise. For global objectives, we prove that Hessian variances are exponentially suppressed, implying that the number of measurement shots must scale as $O(e^{αn})$ with the number of qubits $n$ to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, for termwise local objectives in bounded-depth circuits, the variance decay is polynomial and explicitly controlled by the backward lightcone growth on the interaction graph, ensuring that curvature information remains statistically accessible with $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ shots. Extensive numerical experiments across varying system sizes and circuit depths demonstrate these theoretical bounds and the associated sampling costs. Our results provide a rigorous criterion for the computational tractability of second-order methods at initialization."}

In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry.

The total entropy includes contributions from this atmosphere, and the Bekenstein entropy, which arises from the Gibbons--Hawking--York boundary term, which encodes topological information. We show that the contribution of the quantum atmosphere to the black hole specific heat is positive, indicating that the system may become thermodynamically stable.\n  By analyzing homology groups, we show that the black hole evaporation is a tunneling between topologically distinct spacetimes: Schwarzschild ($χ= 2)$ transitions to the flat spacetime ($χ= 1$) via Hawking radiation, where $χ$ is the Euler characteristic, a topological invariant. This process resembles instanton-driven tunneling in Yang-Mills theories, where topologically non-trivial solutions dominate the vacuum amplitude. In our case, the Gibbons--Hawking--York term dominates the transition amplitude, which induces the evaporation process. These results corroborate the Parikh-Wilczek picture of Hawking radiation and the interpretation of Euclidean black holes as gravitational instantons."}

Mathematically, these devices are described by bistochastic quantum channels, namely completely positive linear maps that are both trace-preserving and identity-preserving. Recently, it has been shown that bidirectional quantum devices can, in principle, be used in ways that are incompatible with a definite input-output direction, giving rise to a new phenomenon called input-output indefiniteness. Here we characterize the most general forms of input-output indefiniteness, associated with a hierarchy of higher-order transformations built from transformations of bistochastic quantum channels. Some levels of the hierarchy correspond to transformations that combine bistochastic channels in a definite causal order, while generally using each channel in an indefinite input-output direction. For other levels of the hierarchy, the indefiniteness can involve both the local input-output direction of each process and the global causal order among the processes. On the foundational side, the hierarchy of higher-order transformations characterized here can be regarded as the largest set of physical processes compatible with a time-symmetric variant of quantum theory, where the possible state transformations are restricted to bistochastic channels."}

We investigate the optical response of Mie voids under both plane-wave and dipolar excitation. For plane waves, the voids preferentially scatter light in the forward direction. Under dipolar excitation, the resulting radiation emission towards the void and beyond is suppressed due to destructive interference between the dipole field with the directional scattered field of the void. These findings identify Mie voids as versatile broadband directional sources, opening pathways for antenna design and energy harvesting at the nanoscale."}

Our results reveal a clear noise hierarchy: dephasing is most tolerable (secure keys achievable at 70\\% efficiency with 30\\% noise), while amplitude damping and depolarizing noise dramatically elevate requirements to over 90\\%. Crucially, we find that security is lost while substantial entanglement remains (concurrence $C \\approx 0.7$--$0.8$), demonstrating that steering violation, not merely entanglement, determines 1SDI-QKD security. To mitigate noise effects, we integrate the BBPSSW entanglement purification protocol, showing that 2--4 rounds can restore positive key rates in otherwise insecure regimes. Our resource overhead analysis reveals that effective key rates peak at moderate purification depths; excessive rounds become counterproductive. These findings establish practical boundaries for deploying 1SDI-QKD over metropolitan-scale quantum networks."}

In particular, when these couplings are comparable, decoherence is dramatically suppressed at exceptional transitions. We trace this behavior to the distinct response of the environmental ground state near non-Hermitian degeneracies and demonstrate the robustness of the effect across multiple models.

When modeling the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule with a (10e, 26o) active space, HSQD matches the accuracy of SQD on IBM quantum hardware using only half the number of qubits and 40% fewer measurements.\n  We further enhance HSQD with a heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) inspired selection of the samples, forming HCI-HSQD.

The underlying mechanism is that the strong initial magnetization provides a directional effect, which inhibits the spin flipping in the process of quantum quench, making the dynamical quantum phase transition difficult to emerge. Since dynamical quantum phase transitions can be experimentally realized in various artificial systems, we hope that the physics predicted here can be experimentally verified in tabletop platforms."}

We demonstrate that the proposed definition naturally decomposes into a Clausius-type entropy production and an additional contribution arising from the time dependence of the effective temperature. Furthermore, we show that requiring the entropy production rate to take the conventional form as the sum of the entropy change and the heat flow constrains the effective temperature to be either constant or equal to a specific energy-matching effective temperature.

By introducing an auxiliary operator, we convert the history-dependent work variance into a time-local integral, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization beyond slow or rapid driving regimes. Applying our method, we find that in the coherent spin-boson model the optimized protocol can switch discontinuously between distinct locally optimal solutions as the relative weight between dissipation and fluctuations is varied. Moreover, for a single-level quantum dot coupled to a fermionic reservoir, the optimized fluctuation-minimizing protocol develops a qualitatively different multi-step structure that is not captured by approaches based on slow- or rapid-driving limits."}

As a result, our method enables the target simulation precision to be reached with approximately half the circuit depth compared to conventional MPF schemes.

But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings."}

A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems."}

Remarkably, the same functions also arise in spin models, including the Ising and Heisenberg models, where distinct interaction structures correspond to different matrix functions. This correspondence has been used to establish the classical hardness of simulating interacting spin systems by relating their output distributions to #P-hard quantities. Previous works, however, have largely been restricted to bipartite spin interactions, where transition amplitudes, which provide the leading-order contribution to the output probabilities, are proportional to the permanent. In this work, we extend the Ising model construction to arbitrary interaction networks and show that transition amplitudes of the Ising Hamiltonian are proportional to the hafnian and the loop-hafnian. The loop-hafnian generalizes both the permanent and hafnian, but unlike these cases, loop-hafnian-based states require Dicke-like superpositions, making the design of corresponding quantum circuits non-trivial. Our results establish a unified framework linking bosonic networks of single photons and Gaussian states with quantum spin dynamics and matrix functions. This unification not only broadens the theoretical foundation of quantum circuit models but also highlights new, diverse, and classically intractable applications."}

In this structure, the number of repetitions of the basic circuit pattern is associated to convergence parameters. This iterative structure behaves similarly to function approximation by series expansion: the higher the truncation order, the better the target gate (i.e. operation) approximation. The asymptotic convergence of the gate error with respect to the number of basic pattern repetitions is known. It is referred to as the query complexity. The underlying convergence law is bounded, but not in an explicit fashion. Upper bounds are generally too pessimistic to be useful in practice. The actual convergence law contains constants that depend on the joint properties of the matrix encoded by the query and the initial state vector, which are difficult to compute classically. This paper proposes a strategy to study this convergence law and extract the associated constants from the gate (operation) approximation at different accuracy (convergence parameter) constructed directly on a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). This protocol is called Numerical Error Extraction by Quantum Measurement Algorithm (NEEQMA). NEEQMA concepts are tested on specific instances of Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Hamiltonian Simulation by Trotterization. Knowing theexact convergence constants allows for selecting the smallest convergence parameters that enable reaching the required gate approximation accuracy, hence satisfying the quantum algorithm's requirements."}

Here, we construct and investigate a Liouvillian exceptional structure based on a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit. Through numerical simulations, we reveal a quantum phase transition occurring at the LEP characterized by a sudden change in dynamical behavior from underdamped oscillations to overdamped relaxations as visualized via Wigner functions and Bloch sphere trajectories. Notably the negativity of the Wigner function serves as a direct signature of genuine quantum coherence unattainable in conventional single-qubit non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we introduce the phase difference between the off-diagonal elements of the Liouvillian eigenmatrices as a novel parameter to quantify the transition. Our results establish the Kerr-cat qubit as a novel continuous-variable setting for exploring dissipative quantum criticality and intrinsic non-Hermitian physics."}

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate.

We measure background quasiparticle tunneling rates at the single-hertz level, with temporal resolution of tens of microseconds. Using time-tagged coincidence analysis, we show that individual events are uncorrelated across devices, whereas burst episodes occur about once per minute and are largely correlated. These bursts have a characteristic lifetime of 7 ms and induce a thousand-fold increase in the quasiparticle tunneling rate across both devices. In addition, we identify a rarer subset of bursts which are accompanied by a shift in the offset charge, at approximately one event per hour.

In this work, we investigate the potential benefits of symmetry within the quantum statistical query ($\\QSQ$) model, which is a natural quantum analog of classical $\\SQ$. Our results uncover three distinct phenomena: (i) we obtain an exponential separation between $\\QSQ$ and $\\SQ$ on a permutation-invariant function class; (ii) we establish query complexity lower bounds for $\\QSQ$ learning that match, up to constant factors, the corresponding classical $\\SQ$ lower bounds for most commonly studied symmetries; however, the potential advantages may occur under highly skewed orbit distributions; and (iii) we further identify a tolerance-based separation exists, where quantum learners succeed at noise levels that render classical $\\SQ$ algorithms ineffective.

We show that the leading term in the evolution equation for the density matrix associated with any quantum clock model gives the von Neumann equation.

In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean.

Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this gap, here we reformulate most AQL methods into a unified framework and establish information-theoretic bounds on their approximation error. Our analysis reveals that the achievable infidelity between the prepared state and target state scales linearly with the total entanglement entropy across subsystems when the loading circuit is applied to the target state. In light of this, we develop AQER, a scalable AQL method that constructs the loading circuit by systematically reducing entanglement in target states. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AQER, using synthetic datasets, classical image and language datasets, and a quantum many-body state datasets with up to 50 qubits. The results show that AQER consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and gate efficiency.

However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.\n  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints."}

It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise. We present, for the first time, an analysis of how noise propagates through an experiment resulting in errors and artefacts on spectral and modal plots. A noise model is essential, because it determines the signal to noise ratio needed to ensure a given level of experimental fidelity."}

All tripartite steering types were classified,comprising three \"1 to 2\" and three \"2 to 1\" steering cases. Through a systematic analysis of all physically relevant scenarios (including accessible and inaccessible modes), we classify three canonical scenarios with one, two and three physically accessible modes. In the scenario of three physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation disrupts quantum steering, with the maximum steering asymmetry during the two-way steering to one-way steering transition precisely demarcating the phase boundary between these regimes. For two physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation exhibits dual behavior: enhancing the steering from Alice and Bob to anti-Charlie under certain parameters while suppressing it under others, while net strengthening other steering types. When considering one physically accessible mode, the Hawking effect of the black hole significantly enhances quantum steering. These findings provide new insights into quantum correlations in curved spacetime and establish observable signatures of Hawking effects in quantum steering phenomena."}

At first sight, this embedding suggests that operations acting on the Hawking radiation could modify the information in the code subspace, potentially leading to an apparent violation of causality. Indeed, in previous studies based on the PSSY model, which incorporates only the topological degrees of freedom of gravity, it was shown that when the error is sufficiently large, a violation of causality can arise, as indicated by a nonvanishing mutual information. In this paper, we investigate the situation in which dynamical gravity also acts on the Hawking radiation. In this case, operations on the Hawking radiation induce nontrivial backreaction on the bulk spacetime appearing in the gravitational path integral for the mutual information -- an effect that is absent when the Hawking radiation is non-gravitating. We find that this backreaction renders the relevant mutual information vanishing. This result implies that, in theories with dynamical gravity, the apparent violation of causality is resolved."}

We compare two experimentally feasible phase-extraction methods - heterodyne-based and density-based - and show that an Airy-Gaussian geometry yields substantially improved robustness to fit-window selection relative to an Airy-Airy collision. In the weakly interacting regime, the extracted cubic coefficient responds linearly to the effective one-dimensional interaction strength. Our approach turns cubic phase dynamics into a practical probe of weak mean-field nonlinearities in self-accelerating condensates."}

However, realizations have mostly been limited to classical applications or artificial setups. In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems."}

We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of caesium dimers correlated to 402P3/2 Rydberg states, with an emphasis on decay via autoionisation (associative ionisation). Our model includes a relativistic treatment of electron-atom scattering with spin-orbit coupling, the perturber's hyperfine structure, and coupling of vibrational levels to a continuum of short-range decay channels. Calculated potential-energy curves predict two families of wells: outer wells near the classical outer turning point supporting long-lived states, and inner wells at shorter range whose lifetimes are limited by tunneling and subsequent vibronic decay. Using photoassociation in an ultracold Cs gas and an analysis of pulsed-field-ionisation signals which are highly selective for the detection of molecules, we assign resonances by binding energy and measure lifetimes. The measured lifetimes of inner-well states increase systematically with increasing detuning and agree with calculated lifetimes; detection of Cs2+ product ions supports autoionisation as a dominant channel. We show that the lifetimes are strongly reduced by spin-orbit interactions in the transient Cs-collision complex, which lift the near-degeneracy in Omega observed for states in the outer well and control the inner-well binding. The identified states also provide promising pathways to create ultracold molecules in ion-pair states."}

We show that, in rotating binary condensates, quantized vortices in one component form hollow channels that act as self-induced weak links for the other, enabling superflow through otherwise impenetrable, phase-separated domains. This introduces a novel barrier mechanism: quantum pressure creates an effective barrier inside the vortex channel, set by the constriction width, which controls the superflow. Tuning the interspecies interaction strength drives a crossover from the hydrodynamic transport to Josephson tunneling regime. Long-range dipolar interactions further tune the weak-link properties, enabling both short links and two coupled junctions in series. Circuit models quantitatively capture the dc current-phase relations for both configurations. These results establish vortices as reconfigurable, interaction-controlled Josephson elements in superfluids."}

The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian."}

Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking."}
