While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such\nintertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition\nbetween non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we\nintroduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the\nmeasurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact\n(trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all\nwithin a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the\ncollective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator\n(TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22\nTHz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted\nbehavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs\nmechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz\nexhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode\nintensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking\nsuggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the\nsplitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via\nparametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two\nphotons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason\ncompetes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency.

Two modes are found: a massive 0.22 THz phason and a 0.11 THz daughter phason resulting from the splitting of the massive one via parametric amplification. The daughter phason appears under the same frequency as the massive one but with a suppressed amplitude, highlighting an unexplored aspect of mode competition in non-equilibrium states.", "motivation": "This paper aims to study the competition between two non-equilibrium modes in an unconventional insulator, which is particularly relevant given the interest in exotic electronic phases and ultrafast phenomena.

The daughter phason is linked to parametric amplification splitting the parent mode, similar to the decay of a neutral pion into photons. The competition between these modes affects their amplitudes, with the daughter phason suppressing the parent's amplitude, offering new insights into mode dynamics.", "conclusion": "The study reveals a novel mechanism for the generation and suppression of collective excitations, emphasizing the potential for understanding ultrafast structural and electronic phenomena in insulators. The findings suggest that the daughter phason plays a crucial role in controlling the parent mode's amplitude, providing a microscopic framework for controlling and manipulating such exotic states of matter in the future."}}

It has been\nproposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological\nCooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) \"spin\"] and $N$ spinless\nelectron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This\nintermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative\ncalculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in\nthe large-$N$ limit. However, the conductance at this intermediate fixed point\nhas not been calculated for generic $N$. Using representation theory, we verify\nthe existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the\nstrong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field\ntheory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and\nconclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the\nfixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator\n(LIO).

For a plane wave incident onto a flat dielectric slab,\nreflection becomes strongly dependent on the incident angle as the electrical\nthickness becomes large.

Recently, inspired by the\ngeneralized Huygens' condition, synthesized admittance sheets implemented as\nmetasurfaces with local response have been shown to remove reflection from a\ndielectric slab in a wide range of incident angles, applicable, however, only\nin the case of small optical slab thickness.

In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon\ndamping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface.\nThis regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not\ninvolve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states.\nThis same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity,\nsuggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic\nenergy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two\neffects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of\nplasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate\nenergy transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores how different adsorbates affect plasmonic energy transfer on gold surfaces. There are two main mechanisms: direct electronic transitions and inelastic scattering. The study shows that resistivity changes correlate with the efficiency of energy transfer, which is useful for understanding plasmon damping.", "motivation": "The study is motivated by the importance of understanding plasmonic energy transfer for applications in light-driven energy conversion. The role of adsorbates in this process is crucial yet not fully understood, prompting the investigation to uncover the mechanisms behind it.", "method": "The study likely uses a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. They might have conducted UV-Vis spectroscopy, DC electrical resistivity measurements, and molecular modeling using DFT or similar approaches to simulate the interactions between plasmons and adsorbates. Tailor-made simulations would help in understanding the different damping mechanisms.", "result": "The findings reveal two mechanisms: direct electronic transitions (BPT) and inelastic scattering (ATP, adenine, DDT). Both mechanisms contribute to plasmon damping and the DC resistivity changes, showing a strong correlation between the two.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that adsorbates can mediate plasmon damping through distinct mechanisms, either resonant transitions or inelastic scattering. The correlation between energy transfer and resistivity changes suggests that resistivity measurements can be used to probe plasmon damping in various systems, offering a useful tool for developing efficient light-driven energy conversion devices."}}

Various approaches have been developed to\nloosen the axioms, of which the use of signed measures is the most successful\n(e.g. the Wigner quasiprobability distribution). As part of our larger effort\nAssumptions of Physics, we have been considering the various roles of measures,\nwhich are used in physics not only for probability, but also to quantify the\ncount of possible states and configurations. These measures play a crucial role\nin classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure. If\none tries to construct a parallel in quantum mechanics, the measure to quantify\nthe count of states turns out to be non-additive. The proper extension of\nprobability calculus may require the use of non-additive measures, which is\nsomething that, to our knowledge, has not yet been explored. The purpose of\nthis paper is to present the general idea and the open problems to an audience\nthat is knowledgeable of the subject of non-additive set functions, though not\nnecessarily in quantum physics, in the hope that it will spark helpful\ndiscussions. We go through the motivation in simple terms, which stems from the\nlink between the entropy of a uniform distribution and the logarithm of the\nmeasure associated to its support. If one extends this notion to quantum\nmechanics, the associated measure is non-additive. We will explore some\nproperties of this \"quantum measure\", its reasonableness in terms of the\nphysics, but its peculiarity on the math side. We will explore the need for a\nset of properties that can properly characterize the measure and a\ngeneralization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative to define a properly extended\nprobability calculus that reduces to the standard additive one on sets of\nphysically distinguishable cases (i.e. orthogonal measurement outcomes).", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a non-additive quantum measure as an alternative to classical probability in quantum mechanics.

The receiver bandwidth density of more than\n3.55 Tb/s/mm2 corresponds to more than an order-of-magnitude larger bandwidth\ndensity-energy efficiency product compared to the state-of-the-art optical PAM4\nreceivers for beyond 100Gb/s links.

In the absence of significant\ndetections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of\nroot-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits\nimprove upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by\nabout 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress\nin our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in\npipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance\nand observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will\nincreasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios\ninvolving neutron stars and black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u8fd0\u884c\u5468\u671f(O4)\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5(O4a)\u5185\uff0c\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u5929\u5de1\u5929\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u81ea2023\u5e745\u670824\u65e5\u81f32024\u5e741\u670816\u65e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u662f\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8d85\u8fc71\u79d2\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u77ed\u751fCP\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u3001\u53cc\u5b50\u661f\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u6bb5\u8986\u76d6\u4e8616\u52302048\u8d6b\u5179\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684 detections\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684 sensitivity limits \u5728\u6839\u65b9\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e45\u503c (hrss) \u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea630%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 pipeline \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u968f\u7740\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u5173\u7684 astrophysical \u666f\u89c2\u3002Overall, \u8fd9\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u7684 detections\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5929\u5de1\u5929\u641c\u7d22\u957f\u65f6\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684 astrophysical \u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0a\u8ff0\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u4f7f\u7528 LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA \u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u4e861-1000\u79d2\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u6bb5\u662f16-2048 Hz\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u8457 detections \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 sensitivity limits \u5e73\u5747\u7ea630%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u65f6\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u5de1\u5929\u641c\u7d22\u968f\u7740\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u5173\u7684 astrophysical \u666f\u89c2\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5f53\u524d\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u7684 detections\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5c06\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8 pipeline \u7684\u6548\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5916\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981 enhancements  \u662f\u63a2\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Here we provide an\noptomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables\nthe transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode.

However, how various\ntypes of noise, which are ubiquitous in real systems, may affect the QMPE\nremains unknown. Here, we address this gap by constructing a general dynamical\nframework for d level open quantum systems under random telegraph noise. By\ninvestigating the dynamics of an extended system and then projecting back, we\nfind that noise can induce additional modes and strongly influence the\nrelaxation dynamics of the original system. Specially, in the limit of long\ncorrelation time of noise, these modes cause anomalous slowdown for certain\ninitial states, thereby inducing or eliminating QMPE, illustrated by a\nthree-level example system. Interestingly, this mechanism leads to a counter\nintuitive effect:the decoherence rate may be slowed down by noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u603b\u7ed3\uff1a\u63a2\u8ba8\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u566a\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u822c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5947\u602a\u7684\u51cf\u901f\u6216\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u521d\u6b21\u611f\u53d7\u4f18\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u566a\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u4f55\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86d\u6c34\u5e73\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u566a\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u8d77\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u539f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8870\u9000\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5f53\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u5f88\u957f\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5f97\u67d0\u4e9b\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u5f02\u5e38\u51cf\u901f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u6216\u6d88\u9664\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u80fd\u7ea7\u793a\u4f8b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u51fa\u73b0\u5947\u602a\u7684\u51cf\u901f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u901f\u7387\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u88ab\u566a\u58f0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6216\u6d88\u9664\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u67d0\u4e9b\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u51cf\u901f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u901f\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

We assume that the system\nevolves in a purely geometric manner based on the parallel transport condition\ndue to Uhlmann. We explore the different interpretations of this evolution\nrelative to observers either coupled to the left or to the right subsystems.\nThe Uhlmann condition breaks the symmetry between left and right by regarding\none of the two possible sets of local unitary operations as gauge degrees of\nfreedom. Then gauging the right side we show that the geometric evolution on\nthe left manifests itself via certain local operations reminiscent of\nnon-unitary filtering measurements. On the other hand on the right the basic\nevolutionary steps are organized into a sequence of unitary operations of a\nholonomic quantum computation. We calculate the Uhlmann connection governing\nthe transport for our model which turns out to be related to higher dimensional\ninstantons. Then we evaluate the anholonomy of the connection for geodesic\ntriangles with geodesic segments defined with respect to the Bures metric. By\nanalysing the explicit form of the local filtering measurements showing up on\nthe left side we realize that they are also optimal measurements for\ndistinguishing two given mixed states in the statistical sense. We also point\nout that by conducting an interference experiment on the right side one can\nobserve the physical effects of the anholonomic quantum computation. We\ndemonstrate this by calculating explicit examples for phase shifts and\nvisibility patterns arising in such interference experiments.

In the experiment, the\nincoherently pumped photon sources exhibit a heralding efficiency of\napproximately 60\\% and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 15000.

This paper introduces a\nnovel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with\nquantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle\nincreasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four\nstate-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN,\nTD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for\noptimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively\nincreases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging\nparameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning\nefficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are\naugmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show\nthat quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a\n2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with\n~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400).

Here we propose an unconventional approach to\norganize and manage the operations of quantum network devices. Instead of a\nhierarchical scheme using layers, like in classical networks and present\nquantum network stack models, we propose a resource-centric task-based scheme.\nIn this scheme, quantum applications pose objectives, initiated by a node, to a\nquantum network, such as sharing an entangled state or sending a qubit along a\npath. The quantum network node initiating the objective consequently derives a\ndistributed workflow, referred to as saga, comprising numerous tasks operating\non resources, which completes the objective.

Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including\nboth value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems\nsuch as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state\ndiagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both\nnoiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric\nthat balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational\nefficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first\nreveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational\nclassifiers.

This has motivated growing\ninterest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum\ncomputers.

One promising quantum CFD approach is\na fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM.\nAlthough efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step,\nimplementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth\ncircuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and\nrepeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address\nthis challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum\ncircuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision\noperator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the\nphysical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum\nconservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate\nset used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit\nconnectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses\nneither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its\ndepth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation\nthat can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on\ntwo benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,\ndemonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow\nrecirculation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6SQC\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3cD2Q9\u683c\u70b9Boltzmann\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f20\u7edfCFD\u5728\u9ad8\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u6d41\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5e03 Boltzmann\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u53e5\u67c4(SQC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u53e5\u67c4\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3cBGK\u78b0\u649e\u7b97\u5b50\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u4e86IBM Heron\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u95e8\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSQC\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u6d41\u52a8\uff08Taylor Green\u6da1\u6d41\u8870\u51cf\u548clid\u9a71\u52a8\u7684 cavity\u6d41\u52a8\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002SQC\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u6f29\u6da1\u8017\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u56de\u73af\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86 Ancilla qubit\u3001\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\u7b49\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Q\u95e8\u8def\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u3002"}}

By employing representation-theoretic\nsymmetry reduction techniques, we demonstrate that these SDPs can be formulated\nand solved with computational complexity $\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)$,\nthereby enabling efficient $\\varepsilon$-additive approximations.

This thesis starts with the\nintroduction and background on how to formally think about uncertainty in the\ndomain of classical states. The concept of probability vector majorization and\nits variants, relative majorization and conditional majorization, are reviewed.\nThis thesis introduces three conceptually distinct approaches to formalize the\nnotion of uncertainty inherent in classical channels.

The paper addresses this gap by proving quantum soundness for all multipartite games.", "method": "The paper uses techniques from operator algebras, specifically showing that the correlations in asymptotic cases correspond to quantum commuting strategies. It generalizes previous results by characterizing sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as quantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case. They also introduce universal C*-algebras of sequential projective-valued-m Measurement (PVM) and establish a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym derivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras, which is of independent interest.", "result": "The authors successfully prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler achieves quantum soundness for all multipartite non-local games by linking asymptotic correlations to quantum commuting strategies through operator algebra techniques.", "conclusion": "This work extends the understanding of quantum soundness in the context of the compiler and provides a more general framework using operator algebra techniques, which could have implications for quantum information theory and game-theoretic models in quantum computing."}}

Submitted to Physical Review A", "summary": "Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for\nquantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar\nmodes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can\nlimit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing.\nRecently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the\ncooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical\nsimulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically\nchanging the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments.\nFurthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower\ntemperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling\nprocess. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin\ntemperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes\nat experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum\ninformation processing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u79bb\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8026\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u9891\u5e73\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u6e29\u5ea6\u964d\u81f3\u4e9a\u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684 drumhead \u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u5bf9\u79bb\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u6548\u7387\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u65b0\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u5728 Penning \u78c1\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u51b7\u5374\u6548\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u964d\u81f3\u4e9a\u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u6574\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u6e29\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}
