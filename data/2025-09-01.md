### [1] [Cauchy matrix structures and solutions to the nonisospectral three-component mKdV equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21434)
*Mengli Tian,Chunxia Li,Yue Li,Fei Li,Yuqin Yao*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: This paper constructs three types of nonisospectral matrix mKdV equations and their solutions using the Cauchy matrix approach. These equations are reduced to a three-component mKdV hierarchy, and explicit soliton and double-pole solutions are provided with their dynamical behaviors analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of soliton equations is essential for understanding nonlinear wave phenomena in various physical systems. This research expands the framework of integrable systems by constructing nonisospectral equations and provides explicit solutions to study their dynamics.

Method: The paper employs the Cauchy matrix approach to construct nonisospectral matrix mKdV equations and analyzes their solutions through complex reduction and dynamic analysis.

Result: The research successfully constructs three nonisospectral matrix mKdV equations, reduces them to a three-component mKdV hierarchy, and derives explicit soliton and double-pole solutions with detailed dynamical behaviors.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the theory of nonisospectral integrable systems by providing new equations and explicit solutions, enhancing our understanding of soliton dynamics in nonuniform media.

Abstract: Nonisospectral integrable systems can describe solitary waves in nonuniform
media. In this paper, we apply the Cauchy matrix approach to construct three
types of nonisospectral matrix modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) eqautions and
present their Cauchy matrix structures and solutions. Further, through complex
reduction, we further obtain three nonisospectral three-component mKdV
(NTCmKdV) equations, which can be regarded as novel members of the
nonisospectral Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy. In particular, the
explicit solutions are given for the soliton solutions, and the double-pole
solutions, respectively. The dynamical behaviors of these solutions are
analyzed to reveal the influence of nonisospectral terms on the solution
structure.

### [2] [An Evaluation of External Magnetic Flux Error in Magnet-Moving Kibble balances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21604)
*Yongchao Ma,Wei Zhao,Songling Huang,Shisong Li*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种降低外磁误差的方法，通过优化称量位置和分析衰减因子，能够在 nerves端测量外磁，其在清华台 Kibble 平台实现了小于 $1 	imes 10^{-8}$ 的相对误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kibble 平衡是实现国际原子单位制 $SI$ 单位的关键技术，外磁误差对测量精度有重要影响。

Method: 有限元分析与实验研究结合，提出的衰减因子分析法可以定量评估外磁。对清华台 Kibble 平台优化称量位置。

Result: 通过优化最优称量位置，实现了远端外磁误差到 $10^{-9}$ 的量级；通过分析测点附近的磁场，实现了对近端外磁场的定量评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为 Kibble 平衡的外包磁场控制提供了可操作的方法，为实现 Acc  $+0.5 	imes 10^{-8}$ SI 单位奠定了基础。

Abstract: The magnet-moving measurement scheme in Kibble balances avoids displacing
force-sensitive components, such as the weighing cell, and enables a broader
magnetic profile measurement range during the velocity phase. However, this
mechanism introduces the risk of asymmetry in the $Bl$ measurement due to
external magnetic flux, leading to a potential systematic error in the final
measurement results. Using the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance magnet as a
case study, this paper investigates the error mechanism through finite element
analysis and experimental investigations. An evaluation method combining
external weak-field measurements with attenuation factor analysis is proposed
to assess external magnetic flux errors in magnet-moving measurement schemes.
The findings demonstrate that selecting an optimal weighing position can reduce
the far-end flux effect to the order of $10^{-9}$. In contrast, the near-end
flux effect can be quantified by monitoring the magnetic field surrounding the
magnet system. In the Tsinghua Kibble balance system, we show that with proper
control of external flux sources, the relative error can be reduced below $1
\times 10^{-8}$ without requiring additional magnetic shielding.

Abstract: We investigate how gravitational time dilation affects the coherence and
entanglement dynamics of spatially separated qubits using open quantum systems
theory. Unlike earlier works that consider only static or Markovian noise
models, our approach incorporates phase damping, amplitude damping, and thermal
excitation, along with a non-Markovian extension. By embedding gravitational
redshift into the local decoherence rates, we demonstrate asymmetry in
entanglement degradation and reveal the possibility of revivals in structured
environments. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum
communication and space-based quantum technologies.

*Davide Rattacaso,Daniel Jaschke,Marco Ballarin,Ilaria Siloi,Simone Montangero*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Introduce quantum normal form reduction for analyzing equivalent symbolic expressions and solving complex equational reasoning problems using quantum-inspired tensor network simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient analysis and solving of equational reasoning problems involving exponentially many equivalent expressions.

Method: Construct an efficiently implementable quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes all equivalent expressions in a quantum superposition. Use quantum-inspired tensor network simulations to solve instances with up to $10^{28}$ equivalent expressions.

Result: The framework successfully addresses fundamental problems in equational reasoning, demonstrates quantum advantages over classical methods, and opens new possibilities for quantum symbolic computation across various domains.

Conclusion: This framework paves the way for future research and applications in quantum and logical circuit design, data compression, computational group theory, linguistics, and biomolecular modeling by leveraging quantum symbolic computation.

Abstract: We introduce quantum normal form reduction, a quantum computational framework
for analyzing abstract symbolic expressions - such as strings, algebraic
formulas, or quantum circuits - that are equivalent under a given set of
transformation rules. These rules form a term rewriting system, a formal method
for deriving equivalences by repeatedly applying substitutions. We construct an
efficiently implementable quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the
entire class of equivalent expressions - potentially exponentially many - in a
quantum superposition. By preparing and manipulating these ground states, we
address fundamental problems in equational reasoning, including the word
problem, i.e., determining whether two expressions are equivalent, counting the
number of equivalent expressions, and identifying structural properties of
equivalence classes. We demonstrate a quantum-inspired version of the algorithm
using tensor network simulations by solving instances involving up to $10^{28}$
equivalent expressions, well beyond the reach of standard classical graph
exploration techniques. This framework opens the path for quantum symbolic
computation in areas ranging from quantum and logical circuit design to data
compression, computational group theory, linguistics, polymers and biomolecular
modeling, enabling the investigation of problems previously out of reach.

*Ruizhe Shen,Zichang Hao,Ching Hua Lee*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper compares QITE and QAOA for solving Ising-type Hamiltonians in portfolio optimization, finding QAOA performs better in noiseless settings, while QITE is more robust under noise but more costly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of quantum computing in finance and optimization necessitates understanding algorithm performance under various noise conditions.

Method: BENCHMARKED TWO PROMINENT QUANTUM ALGORITHMS FOR ISING-TYPE HAMILTONIANS IN PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION, APPLYING THEM TO DIGITAL QUANTUM COMPUTERS AND LOCAL QUANTUM SIMULATORS WITH NOISE.

Result: QAOA shows excellent convergence in noiseless settings, QITE is more robust under noise but more costly numerically.

Conclusion: Understanding the trade-offs between QITE and QAOA is crucial for selecting the right algorithm for practical quantum computing applications in finance and optimization.

Abstract: In this work, we benchmark two prominent quantum algorithms: Quantum
Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA) for obtaining the ground state of Ising-type Hamiltonians.
Specifically, we apply them to the Markowitz portfolio optimization problem in
quantitative finance, on both digital quantum computers and local quantum
simulators with controllable two-qubit errors (noise). In noiseless settings,
we find that QAOA achieves excellent convergence to the optimal results. Under
noisy conditions, the QITE method exhibits greater robustness and stability,
though it incurs substantially more classical numerical cost. In contrast, we
demonstrate that QAOA offers better scalability and can still yield robust
results if the noise can be effectively mitigated. Our findings provide
valuable insights into the trade-offs between scalability and noise tolerance
and demonstrate the practical potential of quantum algorithms for solving
real-world optimization problems on near-term quantum devices.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of spatial photon correlations in optical integration, comparing spatially uncorrelated vs correlated photons in capturing image properties, and links the described scheme to DQC1 model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the role of photon spatial correlations in optical integration and establish a quantum-like model.

Method: The method involves using heralded single photons and a phase-only spatial light modulator with polarization control to experimentally study spatial correlations during optical integration.

Result: The results show that spatially uncorrelated photons capture global image features, while correlated photons better capture local features. The study establishes a direct connection between the described optical integration scheme and the DQC1 model, bridging quantum computation concepts with classical optical integration.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that spatial photon correlations significantly enhance the capability of optical integration, and the findings provide a foundational link between classical optics and quantum computing models, suggesting potential for further explorations at their intersection.

Abstract: In this work, we perform optical integration with heralded single photons and
investigate the role played by the spatial correlation between the photons in
this task. To address this, we experimentally investigate the use of the
transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light in an optical processing scheme
utilizing heralded single photons. The integration is realized over the binary
phases encoded with a phase-only spatial light modulator assisted by
polarization. As a result, while spatially uncorrelated photons can capture the
global properties of an image displayed in a spatial light modulator,
correlated photons capture the local properties of the image better. Also,
emphasize the strong connection between the optical integration scheme
implemented here and the DQC1 (deterministic quantum computation with one
qubit) model.

Abstract: Entangled basis measurements play a crucial role in distributing quantum
entanglement between parties across a quantum network. In this work, we adopt a
semi-device-independent approach that enables the self-testing of n-qubit
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) basis measurements without requiring shared
entanglement between distant parties. Our method relies solely on input-output
statistics from a communication scenario involving n spatially separated
senders, each receiving two bits of input, and a single receiver with no input.
We analyze the robustness of the proposed self-testing protocol. Additionally,
we introduce a protocol for robust self-testing of the three-outcome partial
Bell basis measurement that is easily implementable in an optical setup.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop LREI (Low-Rank Eigenmode Integration), a memory- and
time-efficient scheme for solving quantum Landau-Lifshitz (q-LL) and quantum
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (q-LLG) equations, which govern spin dynamics in open
quantum systems. Although system size grows exponentially with the number of
spins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and
the sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing
density matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for
partial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta
and Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$,
where $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \ll N$ the
effective rank. Similarly, memory costs shrink from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(rN)$, since no full $N\times N$ matrices are formed. A key advance
is handling the invariant subspace of zero eigenvalues. By using Householder
reflectors built for the dominant eigenspace, we perform the solution entirely
without large matrices. For example, a time step of a twenty-spin system, with
density matrix size over one million, now takes only seconds on a standard
laptop. Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to
preserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This
low-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were
previously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG
dynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as
correlations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size
and damping.

Conclusion: 提供了一种通用的量子门路精确综合工具，可为量子算法优化及实际运算提供支持。

Abstract: Unitary synthesis is the process of decomposing a target unitary
transformation into a sequence of quantum gates. This is a challenging task, as
the number of possible gate combinations grows exponentially with the circuit
depth. In this manuscript, we propose an approach using an AlphaZero-inspired
reinforcement-learning agent for the exact compilation of unitaries using
discrete sets of logic gates. The approach achieves low inference time and
proves versatile across different gate sets, and qubit connectivities.
Leveraging this flexibility, we explore unitary synthesis with dynamic circuits
-- circuits that contain non-unitary operations such as measurements and
conditional gates -- and discover unusual implementations of logical quantum
gates. Although the direct synthesis of complete algorithms is intractable, our
approach is well suited for efficiently synthesizing subroutines. This may have
a significant impact when these subroutines are invoked repeatedly during
algorithm execution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study proposes an HCQA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits
(QSCs) to address complex quantum physics problems. The HCQA integrates
computational intelligence techniques by leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for
learning and policy optimization, enhanced by a quantum-based action selection
mechanism based on the Q-values. A quantum circuit encodes the agent current
state using Ry gates, and then creates a superposition of possible actions.
Measurement of the circuit results in probabilistic action outcomes, allowing
the agent to generate optimal QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that
maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of
gates. This computational intelligence-driven HCQA enables the automated
generation of entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states, with
high QFI sensitivity for quantum state estimation and control. Evaluation of
the HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S
gates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1.
This work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum
computation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover
optimal quantum circuit designs for enhanced sensing and estimation tasks.

Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the
minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex
challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of
small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010)
to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum
amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one
coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain
"real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to
have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining
that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time
thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal
protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a
two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for
any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.

Abstract: As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing
and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing
these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in
large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and
efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering
integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation

with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt
tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS)
representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix
approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to
maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while
reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent
improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the
0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results
highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor
networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.

*Dirck van den Ende,Joon Hyung Lee,Alfons Laarman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for expressing linear algebraic problems from quantum physics and physics as weighted model counting (WMC) instances. This enables the application of WMC-based methods to these problems, demonstrating its effectiveness for specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expressing problems in quantum physics and physics as WMC instances would enable the use of existing WMC techniques and tools to solve them.

Method: The authors developed a type system and denotational semantics framework to convert Dirac notation into WMC problems. They implemented this framework in Python and used it to calculate partition functions for the transverse-field Ising model and the Potts model.

Result: The framework successfully converted the models into WMC instances, and the results indicated that developed heuristics in automated reasoning can be systematically applied to a wide range of quantum physics problems through this framework.

Conclusion: This provides a reusable and mathematically rigorous approach for applying WMC to a broad class of problems in quantum physics.

Abstract: Weighted model counting (WMC) has proven effective at a range of tasks within
computer science, physics, and beyond. However, existing approaches for using
WMC in quantum physics only target specific problem instances, lacking a
general framework for expressing problems using WMC. This limits the
reusability of these approaches in other applications and risks a lack of
mathematical rigor on a per-instance basis. We present an approach for
expressing linear algebraic problems, specifically those present in physics and
quantum computing, as WMC instances. We do this by introducing a framework that
converts Dirac notation to WMC problems. We build up this framework
theoretically, using a type system and denotational semantics, and provide an
implementation in Python. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
calculating the partition functions of several physical models: The
transverse-field Ising model (quantum) and the Potts model (classical). The
results suggest that heuristics developed in automated reasoning can be
systematically applied to a wide class of problems in quantum physics through
our framework.

This paper addresses a key challenge in MBQC by examining the fidelity of 4-qubit cluster state generation under two types of decoherence (energy relaxation and pure dephasing). The study aims to provide insights into optimizing MBQC implementations in the presence of realistic noise.

Method: The authors derived analytical expressions to evaluate the fidelity of 4-qubit cluster states under different decoherence mechanisms. They then performed numerical simulations to validate these derivations under various noise conditions, focusing on the evolution times and temperatures where the cluster states can be reliably prepared.

Result: The study demonstrates a fidelity of greater than 90% under ideal (noise-free) conditions for the 4-qubit cluster state. However, the presence of decoherence reduces the fidelity significantly: $T_2$ causes faster decay (e.g., 70% decay at the fourth harmonics) compared to $T_1$ ($T_1$ yields greater than 70% fidelity even as $T_2$ reduces it to 50% within 15 time units). This highlights the importance of targeted error-mitigation strategies specifically for relaxing $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ in short-term MBQC implementations.

Conclusion: This work provides essential insights into the fidelity of cluster state preparation in MBQC under different decoherence mechanisms. The findings underscore the critical need for tailored error-mitigation techniques to maintain high-fidelity quantum computation in near-term MBQC implementations, particularly considering the distinct impacts of $T_1$ and $T_2$ on cluster state preparation.

Abstract: Measurement-based Quantum Computation(MBQC) utilize entanglement as resource
for performing quantum computation. Generating cluster state using entanglement
as resource is a key bottleneck for the adoption of MBQC. To generate cluster
state with charge-qubit arrrays, we provide analytical derivations and
numerical validations for 4-qubit cluster state. We compare our fidelities
under ideal (noise-free) Hamiltonian evolution and due to effect of
decoherence. We show incorporating energy relaxation ($T_1$) yields $>$90\%
fidelity while pure dephasing $T_2$ show $70\%$ decays at fourth harmonics. We
further show under noise $T_2$ decays to 50\% within 15 time units, versus
$>$70\% under relaxation time units ($T_1$)--only. This decay quantify
degradation effect of $T_2$ on preparing cluster--state preparation is more
than $T_1$. We highlight the critical need for targeted error-mitigation
strategies in near-term MBQC implementations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing interest in leveraging quantum computing for NLP tasks, particularly in text generation, motivates this study.

Method: The research evaluates four quantum models (QKSAN, QRWKV, QASA, and another unspecified model) against the traditional Transformer and MLP architectures using five datasets (simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases, haiku poetry, and proverbs). It employs multiple metrics such as perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency measures.

Result: Traditional Transformer models outperform quantum-inspired models in terms of perplexity and BLEU scores, but quantum models like QKSAN and QRWKV achieve competitive performance in specific scenarios without repetitions or with perfect vocabulary diversity.

Conclusion: While traditional models remain superior in general performance, quantum-inspired approaches show promise in particular contexts, particularly in tasks where repetition and vocabulary diversity are critical concerns, such as generating haiku poetry or proverbs without repetition.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest
BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive
performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1
score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates
perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

Conclusion: Rivet 转编器在量子计算中的应用具有显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Transpilation is a crucial process in preparing quantum circuits for
execution on hardware, transforming virtual gates to match device-specific
topology by introducing swap gates and basis gates, and applying optimizations
that reduce circuit depth and gate count, particularly for two-qubit gates. As
the number of qubits increases, the cost of transpilation escalates
significantly, especially when trying to find the optimal layout with minimal
noise under the qubit connectivity constraints imposed by device topology. In
this work, we use the Rivet transpiler, which accelerates transpilation by
reusing previously transpiled circuits. This approach is relevant for cases
such as quantum chemistry, where multiple Pauli terms need to be measured by
appending a series of rotation gates at the end for non-commuting Paulis, and
for more complex cases when quantum circuits need to be modified iteratively,
as occurs in quantum layerwise learning. We demonstrate up to 600% improvement
in transpilation time for quantum layerwise learning using the Rivet transpiler
compared to standard transpilation without reuse.

Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a key component in many quantum
algorithms. In particular, the problem of sparse QSP (SQSP) $\unicode{x2013}$
the task of preparing the states with only a small number of non-zero
amplitudes $\unicode{x2013}$ has garnered significant attention in recent
years. In this work, we focus on reducing the circuit depth of SQSP with
limited number of ancilla qubits. We present two SQSP algorithms: one with
depth $O(n\log d)$, and another that reduces depth to $O(n)$. The latter
leverages mid-circuit measurement and feedforward, where intermediate
measurement outcomes are used to control subsequent quantum operations. Both
constructions have size $O(dn)$ and use $O(d)$ ancilla qubits. Compared to the
state-of-the-art SQSP algorithm in arXiv:2108.06150, which allows an arbitrary
number of ancilla qubits $m>0$, both of our algorithms achieve lower circuit
depth when $m=d$.

Abstract: We study $k$-positive linear maps on matrix algebras and address two
problems, (i) characterizations of $k$-positivity and (ii) generation of
non-decomposable $k$-positive maps. On the characterization side, we derive
optimization-based conditions equivalent to $k$-positivity that (a) reduce to a
simple check when $k=d$, (b) reveal a direct link to the spectral norm of
certain order-3 tensors (aligning with known NP-hardness barriers for $k<d$),
and (c) recast $k$-positivity as a novel optimization problem over separable
states, thereby connecting it explicitly to separability testing. On the
generation side, we introduce a Lie-semigroup-based method that, starting from
a single $k$-positive map, produces one-parameter families that remain
$k$-positive and non-decomposable for small enough times. We illustrate this by
generating such families for $d=3$ and $d=4$. We also formulate a semi-definite
program (SDP) to test an equivalent form of the positive partial transpose
(PPT) square conjecture (and do not find any violation of the latter). Our
results provide practical computational tools for certifying $k$-positivity and
a systematic way to sample $k$-positive non-decomposable maps.

Abstract: The growing demand for drone navigation in urban and restricted airspaces
requires real-time path planning that is both safe and scalable. Classical
methods often struggle with the computational load of high-dimensional
optimization under dynamic constraints like obstacle avoidance and no-fly
zones. This work introduces QUAV, a quantum-assisted UAV path planning
framework based on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), to
the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first applications of QAOA for
drone trajectory optimization. QUAV models pathfinding as a quantum
optimization problem, allowing efficient exploration of multiple paths while
incorporating obstacle constraints and geospatial accuracy through UTM
coordinate transformation. A theoretical analysis shows that QUAV achieves
linear scaling in circuit depth relative to the number of edges, under fixed
optimization settings. Extensive simulations and a real-hardware implementation
on IBM's ibm_kyiv backend validate its performance and robustness under noise.
Despite hardware constraints, results demonstrate that QUAV generates feasible,
efficient trajectories, highlighting the promise of quantum approaches for

Motivation: Understanding light-matter interaction in ZMW systems has potential applications in quantum optics and nanotechnology.

Method: Theoretical model based on quantum mechanics and Maxwell's equations was used to analyze light transmission through ZMW containing a single atom.

Result: Theoretical calculations demonstrate that at resonance, light transmission is enhanced, and off-resonance suppression occurs. Analytical expressions for transmission probability and spatiotemporal intensity distributions were derived.

Conclusion: Single atom ZMW systems can be used as tools for studying quantum optical phenomena and designing nano-optical devices.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a theory of light transmission through a Zero-Mode

Abstract: Designing effective quantum models for real-world tasks remains a key
challenge within Quantum Machine Learning (QML), particularly in applications
such as credit card fraud detection, where extreme class imbalance and evolving
attack patterns demand both accuracy and adaptability. Most existing approaches
rely on either manually designed or randomly initialized circuits, leading to
high failure rates and limited scalability. In this work, we introduce
CircuitHunt, a fully automated quantum circuit screening framework that
streamlines the discovery of high-performing models. CircuitHunt filters
circuits from the KetGPT dataset using qubit and parameter constraints, embeds
each candidate into a standardized hybrid QNN, and performs rapid training with
checkpointing based on macro-F1 scores to discard weak performers early. The
top-ranked circuit is then fully trained, achieving 97% test accuracy and a
high macro-F1 score on a challenging fraud detection benchmark. By combining
budget-aware pruning, empirical evaluation, and end-to-end automation,
CircuitHunt reduces architecture search time from days to hours while
maintaining performance. It thus provides a scalable and task-driven tool for
QML deployment in critical financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of learning from quantum data by extending classical learning frameworks to quantum processes, ensuring that quantum learning models can be as effective as their classical counterparts.

Method: The method involves defining quantum TERM, deriving sample complexity bounds, establishing PAC generalization bounds, and providing agnostic learning guarantees.

Result: The results include upper bounds on QTERM's sample complexity, new PAC generalization bounds for classical TERM, and agnostic learning guarantees for quantum hypothesis selection.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum learning theory by providing a comprehensive framework for learning quantum processes with theoretical guarantees on generalization and learnability.

Abstract: Learning from quantum data presents new challenges to the paradigm of
learning from data. This typically entails the use of quantum learning models
to learn quantum processes that come with enough subtleties to modify the
theoretical learning frameworks. This new intersection warrants new frameworks
for complexity measures, including those on quantum sample complexity and
generalization bounds. Empirical risk minimization (ERM) serves as the
foundational framework for evaluating learning models in general. The diversity
of learning problems leads to the development of advanced learning strategies
such as tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM). Theoretical aspects of
quantum learning under a quantum ERM framework are presented in [PRX Quantum 5,
020367 (2024)]. In this work, we propose a definition for TERM suitable to be
employed when learning quantum processes, which gives rise to quantum TERM
(QTERM). We show that QTERM can be viewed as a competitive alternative to
implicit and explicit regularization strategies for quantum process learning.
This work contributes to the existing literature on quantum and classical
learning theory threefold. First, we prove QTERM learnability by deriving upper
bounds on QTERM's sample complexity. Second, we establish new PAC
generalization bounds on classical TERM. Third, we present QTERM agnostic
learning guarantees for quantum hypothesis selection. These results contribute
to the broader literature of complexity bounds on the feasibility of learning
quantum processes, as well as methods for improving generalization in quantum
learning.

Abstract: Detailed understanding of physical measurements is essential for devising
efficient metrological strategies and measurement-feedback schemes, as well as
finding fundamental limitations on measurement sensitivity. In the quantum
regime, measurements modify the state of the system of interest through
measurement backaction as a direct consequence of the Heisenberg principle. In
cavity optomechanics and electromechanics, a plethora of strategies exist for
measuring the mechanical motion using electromagnetic fields, each leading to
different competition between measurement imprecision and backaction. While
this range of techniques allows broad applications of optomechanical and
electromechanical devices, it makes direct comparison of different measurement
methods difficult. We develop a formalism for quantifying the performance of
optomechanical measurements using a few relevant figures of merit. Our approach
is inspired by similar characterizations in quantum optics and quantifies the
main properties of quantum measurements -- the ability to distinguish different
quantum states and preservation of signal in the presence of measurement noise.
We demonstrate our concept on the most common optomechanical measurements --
displacement detection, coherent quantum noise cancellation, and quantum
nondemolition measurements -- and perform detailed analysis of errors in
optomechanical nondemolition measurements. This newly acquired knowledge allows
us to propose a strategy for quantum nondemolition measurements in
levitodynamics using coherent scattering. Our results complement existing
knowledge of linear optomechanical interactions and open the way to new
understanding of optomechanical measurements, thus allowing also novel
applications of optomechanical devices in fundamental physics and quantum
technologies.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach to improve the efficiency of measuring nuclear spins in solid-state devices using deep learning and signal optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuclear spin measurements are essential for quantum technologies but are often time-consuming. The need arises for a faster, more efficient method without compromising accuracy.

Method: The authors extend their previously developed SALI model by introducing the surrogate information gain (SIG). SIG is based on the expected variance of the signal and is easier to compute than the information gain rooted in Bayesian estimation. The method involves using deep learning to optimize the selection of data points in measurements, thereby reducing the time required.

Result: The approach demonstrated significant improvements. In the high-field regime, an 85% reduction in measurement time was achieved with minimal performance impact. The method also showed potential for further improvements in the low-field regime by optimizing temporal resolution and applying SIG.

Conclusion: This work represents a promising step in enhancing the efficiency of quantum sensing and nuclear spin characterization by integrating deep learning with optimized signal selection. The validated approach opens the door for scaling these techniques to larger nuclear spin systems and advancing quantum technologies.

Abstract: The characterization of nuclear spin environments in solid-state devices
plays an important role in advancing quantum technologies, yet traditional
methods often demand long measurement times. To address this challenge, we
extend our recently developed deep-learning-based SALI model (Signal-to-image
ArtificiaL Intelligence) by introducing the surrogate information gain (SIG) to
optimize the selection of data points in the measurements. This approach
significantly reduces time requirements in experiments while preserving
accuracy in nuclear spin detection. The SIG is a figure of merit based on the
expected variance of the signal, which is more straightforward to compute than
the expected information gain rooted in Bayesian estimation. We demonstrate our
approach on a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond coupled to $^{13}$C
nuclei. In the high-field regime, our variance-based optimization is validated
with experimental data, resulting in an 85$\%$ reduction in measurement time
for a modest reduction in performance. This work also constitutes the first
validation of SALI on experimental data. In the low-field regime, we explore
its performance on simulated data, predicting a 60$\%$ reduction in the total
experiment time by improving the temporal resolution of the measurements and
applying SIG. This demonstrates the potential of integrating deep learning with
optimized signal selection to enhance the efficiency of quantum sensing and
nuclear spin characterization, paving the way for scaling these techniques to
larger nuclear spin systems.

of imperfections without memory effects, it can be combined with proofs
addressing source imperfections in a modular manner. We apply our framework to
compute key rates for the decoy-state BB84 protocol, when the beam splitting
ratio, the detection efficiency, and dark counts of the detectors are only

Abstract: Current prevailing designs of quantum random number generators (QRNGs)
designs typically employ post-processing techniques to distill raw random data,
followed by statistical verification with suites like NIST SP 800-22. This
paper demonstrates that this widely adopted practice harbors a critical flaw.
We show that the powerful extraction process can create a false sense of
security by perfectly concealing physical-layer attacks, rendering the
subsequent statistical tests blind to a compromised entropy source. We
substantiate this claim across two major QRNG architectures. Experimentally, we
severely compromise an QRNG based on amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with
a power supply ripple attack. While the resulting raw data catastrophically
fails NIST tests, a standard Toeplitz extraction transforms it into a final
sequence that passes flawlessly. This outcome highlights a profound danger:
since the validation process is insensitive to the quality of the raw data, it
implies that even a fully predictable input could be processed to produce a
certified, yet completely insecure, random sequence. Our theoretical analysis
confirms this vulnerability extends to phase-noise-based QRNGs, suggesting a
need for security validation to evolve beyond statistical analysis of the final
output and consider the entire generation process.

Abstract: Quantum mechanical problems are among the hardest to simulate and, in some
cases, remain intractable even for the most powerful computers. Quantum
computing has emerged as a new technological platform to address such
challenges, with rapid advances in recent years. Yet, current quantum devices
remain noisy and limited in scale. Hence, it is essential to identify
classically hard problems of practical interest and tractable with existing
quantum devices. Among potential applications, the real-time simulation of
quantum systems is one of the most promising to deliver an early, practical
quantum advantage. This doctoral thesis is therefore centered around simulating
quantum dynamics on quantum devices. We first present an overview of the most
relevant quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics, highlighting respective
advantages and limitations. Further, we identify relevant problems within
quantum dynamics that could benefit from quantum simulation in the near future.
Second, we propose a method for benchmarking hardware and error mitigation
algorithms that is based on well-understood theoretical results and suffers
from no scaling issues. The resulting quality metric is intuitive and
transferable to other applications. We successfully implement the scheme on up
to 133 qubits, demonstrating coherent evolution up to a two-qubit gate depth of
28, featuring 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. Third, we
propose a novel variant of probabilistic error amplification to implement open
quantum dynamics, relying on characterizing and altering hardware noise to
mimic the system-environment interaction under study. Lastly, we present two
studies on state preparation and phase classification: first, a hybrid
algorithm to prepare ground states of electron-phonon systems; second, a
quantum machine learning-based approach to distinguish phases in previously
prepared quantum states.

this work integrates classical quantum computing applications - such as

financial scenarios to identify domains where quantum approaches can surpass
classical techniques. Furthermore, the paper explores the vulnerabilities
quantum computing introduces to digital finance-related applications and
blockchain security, including risks to digital signatures, hash functions, and
randomness generation, and discusses mitigation strategies through PQC and
quantum-resilient alternatives of classical digital finance tools and
blockchain architectures. By addressing both quantum blockchain, quantum key
distribution (QKD) as well as quantum communication networks, his review
presents a more holistic perspective than prior studies, offering actionable
insights for researchers, financial practitioners, and policymakers navigating
the intersection of quantum computing, blockchain, and secure financial

Result: 提出了两种新的下界，一种与熵产生相关，另一种与前向后向不对称性相关。

Conclusion: 为开放量子系统提供了全面的Precision限制框架。

Abstract: The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by
thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and
kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively
studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian
regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on
the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems coupled to
environments of arbitrary strength and subjected to two-point measurements. By
introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and
backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any
time-antisymmetric current is constrained by both entropy production and this
forward-backward asymmetry. For general observables, we prove that their
relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity
term. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding
precision limits in broad classes of general open quantum systems.

Abstract: We analyze the entanglement between electronic and nuclear motions in
molecular wave functions, by using different widely used ansatzes in molecular
Hamiltonian models (H$^+_2$ in 1D and the Shin-Metiu model); namely, i)
Born-Oppenheimer separation in both adiabatic and ii) diabatic pictures and
beyond it, iii) using a Born-Huang expansion, which involves non-adiabatic
couplings in the solution. Any molecule can be considered a bipartite system in
terms of electronic and nuclear halfspaces. Accordingly, the Schmidt
decomposition theorem can be applied to each molecular ansatz to find a much
shorter representation in terms of Schmidt basis and to estimate the
entanglement content through the calculation of von Neumann entropies. Although
here we justify that the ground BO vibronic state of any molecule may be
regarded as an almost separable and non-entangled state, this property worsens
with the vibrational excitation, which increases the entanglement
monotonically. The interlace between electronic and nuclear wave functions for
each vibronic state becomes even more critical for those electronic excited
states whose electronic wave functions change drastically with the molecular
geometry. We find that the entanglement may be quantified by the variation of
the electronic wave function along the different nuclear geometries, and that
the nuclear wave function indeed plays the role of a tester. In addition, the
presence of avoided crossings among the potential energy curves brings about a
strong enhancement of entanglement in the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic picture,
which instead is much reduced in a diabatic picture. Finally, the Born-Huang
expansion uncovers some synergistic vibronic states whose entanglement content
is larger than that of any Born-Oppenheimer component in the superposition.

Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) concerns the statistical inference of
unknown quantum states. In the general setting of composite hypotheses, the
goal of QHT is to determine whether an unknown quantum state belongs to one or
another of two classes of states based on the measurement of a number of copies
of the state. Prior art on QHT with composite hypotheses focused on a
fixed-copy two-step protocol, with state estimation followed by an optimized
joint measurement. However, this fixed-copy approach may be inefficient, using
the same number of copies irrespective of the inherent difficulty of the
testing task. To address these limitations, we introduce the quantum sequential
universal test (QSUT), a novel framework for sequential QHT in the general case
of composite hypotheses. QSUT builds on universal inference, and it alternates
between adaptive local measurements aimed at exploring the hypothesis space and
joint measurements optimized for maximal discrimination. QSUT is proven to
rigorously control the type I error under minimal assumptions about the
hypothesis structure. We present two practical instantiations of QSUT, one
based on the Helstrom-Holevo test and one leveraging shallow variational
quantum circuits. Empirical results across a range of composite QHT tasks
demonstrate that QSUT consistently reduces copy complexity relative to
state-of-the-art fixed-copy strategies.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems offer a promising platform for studying quantum
phenomena and developing applied technologies, benefiting from the individual
strengths of their components. Here, we present a novel hybrid quantum platform
composed of solid noble gas crystals doped with spin impurities atop
superconducting resonators. The noble gas crystals provide a soft, inert,

We demonstrate the ability to reach the strong coupling regime between the
atomic impurity ensemble and the superconducting resonator at mK temperatures,
and perform coherence time measurements. Our proof-of-principle measurements
show that this platform offers a unique architecture for exploring fundamental

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Block encoding of sparse matrices underpins powerful quantum algorithms such
as quantum singular value transformation, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum
linear solvers, but its efficient gate-level implementation for arbitrary
sparse matrices remains a major challenge. We introduce a unified framework
that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead,
amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block
encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions.
Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization,
which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve
nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve
superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods
on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth
and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations
and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.

TL;DR: A new method for preparing singlet states for Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) using a shallow circuit by combining orbital-optimized pCCD and UpCCD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient methods for quantum algorithms like QPE is crucial for quantum computing applications, especially for quantum chemistry and materials science.

Method: Combination of orbital-optimized pCCD and UpCCD with sparse amplitude matrices to create shallow circuits.

Result: Shallow circuits can prepare high-fidelity singlet states for QPE in various molecular models.

Conclusion: The method reduces circuit depth while maintaining high accuracy, potentially speeding up QPE implementations.

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), the quantum algorithm for estimating
eigenvalues of a given Hermitian matrix and preparing its eigenvectors, is
considered the most promising approach to finding the ground states and their
energies of electronic systems using a quantum computer. It requires, however,
to be warm--started from an initial state with sufficiently high overlap with
the ground state. For strongly-correlated states, where QPE is expected to have
advantage over classical methods, preparation of such initial states requires
deep quantum circuits and/or expensive hybrid quantum-classical optimization.
It is well-known that orbital-optimized paired Coupled Cluster Doubles
(oo-pCCD) method can describe the static correlation features of many strongly
correlated singlet states. We show that pCCD and its unitary counterpart,
UpCCD, become equivalent in the limit of small amplitudes if the amplitude
matrix is sufficiently sparse. We demonstrate that substituting leading oo-pCCD
amplitudes into the UpCCD Ansatz allows to prepare high-fidelity singlet states
for models of multiple-bond dissociation in ethene, ethyne and dinitrogen, as
well as for 1D Hubbard models at half-filling, with very shallow circuits. We
envisage our method to be of general use for approximate preparation of singlet
states for Quantum Phase Estimation and related algorithms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm is commonly used to solve
combinatorial optimization problems. While unconstrained problems map naturally
into the algorithm, incorporating constraints typically requires penalizing
constraint violations in the objective function. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach that encodes constraints as Boolean expressions in
exclusive-sum-of-products (ESOP) form before penalization. We test this method
on the maximum independent set problem using graphs with 3 to 20 vertices and
find that ESOP constraint formulations achieve higher approximation ratios than
standard constraint penalization methods, with percent increases of up to
30.3%. Furthermore, ESOP constraint formulations result in higher approximation
ratios than standard QAOA penalization approaches after one layer of the
algorithm on approximately 64% of the tested graphs.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Optimal embedded qubit mapping in quantum circuits can significantly improve circuit performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping virtual qubits to physical ones is crucial for quantum computing efficiency, but finding optimal maps is NP-hard. This paper explores how ignoring conventional layering constraints can lead to better solutions.

Method: The paper generalizes the Qubit Mapping Problem (QMP) and introduces a flexible branch-and-bound algorithm that can handle both layering constraints and ignore them.

Result: The results on benchmark circuits show that ignoring layering can reduce SWAP counts and improve makespan.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a promising way to overcome the limitations of traditional QMP solutions by allowing for more optimal mappings.

Abstract: Quantum circuits are typically represented by a (ordered) sequence of gates
over a set of virtual qubits. During compilation, the virtual qubits of the
gates are assigned to the physical qubits of the underlying quantum hardware, a
step often referred to as the qubit assignment problem. To ensure that the
resulting circuit respects hardware connectivity constraints, additional SWAP
gates are inserted as needed, which is known as the qubit routing problem.
Together, they are called the Qubit Mapping Problem (QMP), which is known to be
NP-hard. A very common way to deal with the complexity of the QMP is to
partition the sequence of gates into a sequence of gate groups (or layers).
However, this imposes a couple of important restrictions: (1) SWAP gates can
only be added between pairs of consecutive groups, and (2) all the gates
belonging to a certain group have to be executed (in parallel) in the same time
slot. The first one prevents gates to be re-arranged optimally, while the
second one imposes a time discretization that practically ignores gate
execution time. While this clearly reduces the size of the feasible space,
little is still known about how much is actually lost by imposing a fixed
layering when looking at the minimization of either the number of SWAPs or the
makespan of the compiled circuit. In this paper, we present a flexible branch
and bound algorithm for a generalized version of the QMP that either considers
or ignores the gate layering and the gate execution time. The algorithm can
find find proven optimal solutions for all variations of the QMP, but also
offers a great platform for different heuristic algorithms. We present results
on several benchmark sets of small quantum circuits, and we show how ignoring
the layering can significantly improve some key performance indicators of the
compiled circuit.

Conclusion: 本文的贡献在于，以控制作为基本构建器，扩展了 props 框架到受控 props，从而简化了量子态推理的复杂性。

Abstract: Control is a predominant concept in quantum and reversible computational
models. It allows to apply or not a transformation on a system, depending on
the state of another system. We introduce a general framework for diagrammatic
reasoning featuring control as a constructor. To do so, we provide an
elementary axiomatisation of control functors, extending the standard formalism
of props (symmetric monoidal categories with the natural numbers as objects) to
controlled props. As an application, we show that controlled props ease
diagrammatic reasoning for quantum circuits by allowing a simple complete set
of relations that only involves relations acting on at most three qubits,
whereas it is known that in the standard prop setting any complete
axiomatisation requires relations acting on arbitrarily many qubits.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Twin-Field QKD (TF-QKD), a leading quantum communication protocol, enables secure key distribution over long distances by utilizing quantum states' interference. This paper explores side-channels in OIL-based TF-QKD, demonstrating two attack scenarios: rapid intensity modulation of the reference laser and undetectable Trojan-horse signals. Countermeasures proposed include high-speed photodiodes for real-time power monitoring and targeted spectral filtering to detect and suppress out-of-band signals. Results show that these solutions enhance security without adding significant complexity, important for the practical deployment of TF-QKD in quantum communication networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for secure communication, especially in long-distance scenarios, drives the exploration of quantum communication protocols. Additionally, the recent development of TF-QKD has brought attention to understanding and mitigating potential security threats.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes potential side-channels in OIL-based TF-QKD by examining various optical degrees of freedom. It experimentally demonstrates two attack scenarios using rapid intensity modulation and undetectable wavelengths. Countermeasures are then proposed and implemented.

Result: The proposed countermeasures effectively enhance the security of TF-QKD systems. The experimental results confirm that these solutions do not significantly increase complexity or degrade performance.

Conclusion: TF-QKD systems can be practically secured against potential side-channel attacks through effective countermeasures, which is crucial for their deployment in real-world quantum communication networks. This work provides valuable insights into enhancing the robustness and security of quantum communication protocols.

Abstract: Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) has emerged as a leading quantum
communication protocol, enabling secure key distribution over unprecedented
distances by utilising coherent interference of quantum states. Optical
Injection Locking (OIL) architectures have been used to simplify the precise
phase and frequency stabilisation required by TF-QKD. In this work, we
systematically analyse potential side-channels in OIL-based TF-QKD that can be
introduced through the various optical degrees of freedom of the externally
injected reference laser. We experimentally demonstrate two realistic attack
scenarios: rapid intensity modulation of the reference laser and Trojan-horse
signals exploiting wavelengths undetectable by conventional monitoring
techniques. To counter these vulnerabilities, we propose straightforward and
highly effective countermeasures including high-speed photodiodes for real-time
power monitoring and targeted spectral filtering to detect and suppress
out-of-band signals. Our experimental results confirm that these practical
solutions substantially reinforce the security of TF-QKD systems without
significant additional complexity or performance degradation. More broadly, our
analysis highlights the critical importance of comprehensive optical monitoring
to ensure the robust practical deployment of TF-QKD in real-world quantum
communication networks.

Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a Mach Zehnder interferometer using a
special class of generalized coherent states constructed from generalized
Heisenberg and deformed su(1,1) algebras. These states, derived from a
perturbed harmonic oscillator with a four parameter deformed spectrum, provide
enhanced tunability and nonclassical features. The quantum Fisher information
and its associated quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound are used to define the
fundamental precision limits in phase estimation. We analyze the phase
sensitivity under three realistic detection methods: difference intensity
detection, single mode intensity detection, and balanced homodyne detection.
The performance of each method is compared with the quantum Cram\'er Rao bound
to evaluate their optimality. Our results demonstrate that, for suitable
parameter regimes, these generalized coherent states enable phase sensitivities
approaching the quantum limit, offering a flexible framework for precision
quantum metrology.

non-Markovian dynamics that lie beyond the scope of the standard

the possibility of engineering their coherent superpositions. Our results
provide analytical insight into non-Markovian light-matter interaction and
suggest a feasible implementation using superconducting circuit platforms.

Abstract: Classical First-Passage-Time Distributions (FPTDs) have been extensively
studied both theoretically and experimentally. Their quantum counterparts,
Quantum First-Passage-Time Distributions (QFPTDs), remain largely unexplored
and have deep implications for both fundamental physics and the development of
emerging quantum technologies. We measure the first QFPTDs using a motional

sequence to perform tunable stroboscopic projective measurements of the
motional state of a trapped ion. We measure QFPTDs of the ion energy when
coupled to electric-field noise and establish a clear connection with its
classical counterpart. The measurement protocol developed here is broadly
applicable to other quantum systems and provides a powerful method for
exploring a broad range of QFPTD phenomena. With these results we open a new

Abstract: This work explores the black hole information loss paradox, a fundamental

gravity. The work revisits the time-dependent behavior of HEE to probe black

describes the entropy evolution of Hawking radiation. It also discusses the
relationship between conformal field theory (CFT) microstates and black hole
thermodynamics through the AdS/BCFT correspondence, suggesting that only a
subset of microstates corresponds to black holes with smooth interiors, while
others may involve firewalls. The study extends black hole thermal entropy to
time-dependent entanglement entropy, offering a perspective on the interplay

Abstract: In this work, we investigate radiative corrections in the higher-order
extension of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model coupled to standard spinor matter
in $2+1$ dimensions. We begin analyzing the higher-order gauge sector, where we
find the modes and the polarizations vectors associated to a massive photon and
ghost field. The higher-order gauge model is canonically quantized and as
expected the resulting algebra of creation and annihilation operators
corresponds to an indefinite metric in Hilbert space. Subsequently, we compute
all relevant one-loop diagrams in the modified QED starting with the fermion
self-energy. We show that the induced corrections to the fermion two-point
function produce two independent fermionic degrees of freedom, which can be
included in a redefined Lagrangian describing two decoupled fermions fields,
one corresponding to a physical particle and the other to a negative-norm ghost
state. We take advantage of this decomposition to compute the photon
polarization operator and the vertex correction, both of which are found to be
finite. Finally, we analyze the causal behavior of the model by computing the
commutator of gauge fields at different spacetime points, and found that
microcausality is preserved.

*Mark Van Raamsdonk*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究显示，在常规量子场论中，区域的熵通常在边界处发散，但某些熵的组合可以抵消发散项，从而产生有限的量，这些量可以用来了解量子态的本质信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解量子场论中的熵及其相互关系对于研究量子引力和量子信息理论具有重要意义。

Method: 研究者使用傅里叶变换和莫比乌斯变换等数学工具，分析了不同区域熵的组合，成功构造了一组消除边界发散和高余维交界发散的量。

Result: 所有这些量都可以表示为三种基本类型的线性组合：一是区域熵与其补区的熵之差，二是不相邻区域之间的互信息，三是三个不相交区域的三重信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解量子场论中的熵性质和纠缠结构提供了新的工具和视角。

Abstract: Entropies associated with spatial subsystems in conventional local quantum
field theories are typically divergent when the spatial regions have
boundaries. However, in certain linear combinations of the entropies for
various subsystems, these divergences may cancel, giving finite quantities that
provide information-theoretic data about the underlying state. In this note, we
show that all such quantities can be written as linear combinations of three
basic types of quantities: i) the entropy of a spatial subsystem minus the
entropy of its complementary subsystem, ii) the mutual information between
non-adjacent subsystems, and iii) the tripartite information for triples of
disjoint sub-systems. For a fixed decomposition of a spatial slice into
regions, we describe a basis of sums of entropies for collections of for these
regions for which all divergences related to both region boundaries and
higher-codimension intersections of regions cancel. Key mathematical technology
used in this work (Fourier transforms on the Boolean cube and M\"obius
transformations of functions on partially ordered sets) and several of the main
proof ideas were suggested by AI (ChatGPT5). We offer a few comments on the use
of AI in physics and mathematics, based on our experience.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $2$-split behavior of tree-level amplitudes
of bi-adjoint scalar (BAS), Yang-Mills (YM), non-linear sigma model (NLSM), and
general relativity (GR) theories under certain kinematic conditions. Our
approach begins with a proof, based on the Feynman diagram method, of the
$2$-split property for tree-level BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes with
$\mathrm{X}={\mathrm{YM},\mathrm{NLSM},\mathrm{GR}}$. The proof relies
crucially on a particular pattern in the Feynmam rules of various vertices.
Building on this, we use the expansion of X amplitudes into BAS$\oplus$X
amplitudes to establish the $2$-split behavior. As a byproduct, we derive
universal expansions of the resulting pure X currents into BAS currents, which
closely parallel the corresponding on-shell amplitude expansions.

Result: 论文展示了这种方法能够统一描述 $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon)，$s=1/2$ (Dirac) 和 $s=1$ (Proca) 的场。通过零次、一次和二次展开，这些场的方程可以从 Schr"odinger 理论导出。

Conclusion: 该研究为相对论性量子力学提供了一个新的数学框架，有效解决了负能和负概率的问题。

Abstract: We describe relativistic particles with spin as points moving in phase space
$X=T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$, where $T^* R^{1,3}=R^{1,3}\times
R^{1,3}$ is the space of coordinates and momenta, and $C^2_L$ and $C^2_R$ are
the spaces of representation of the Lorentz group of type $(\frac12 , 0)$ and
$(0, \frac12)$. Passing from relativistic mechanics with a Lorentz-invariant
Hamiltonian function $H$ on the phase space $X$ to quantum mechanics with a
Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$, we introduce two complex conjugate line bundles
$L_C^+$ and $L_C^-$ over $X$. Quantum particles are introduced as sections
$\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$,
and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$
antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave
functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$
associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$.
Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the
Schr\"odinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin
$s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in
the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$
in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon,
Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the Schr\"odinger
equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$.
Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized
photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the
fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents,
which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic
quantum mechanics.

Result: M2-膜的势垒函数可以用Airy函数表示，适用多种膜模型，包括ABJM理论及其变形。

Conclusion: 该研究为M2-膜理论提供了重要结论，为进一步研究其推广和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilize the results of our companion paper, arXiv:2502.20444, which
explores the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric
Calabi--Yau manifolds $X$, to establish an exact holographic correspondence
with M2-brane partition functions. We rigorously test this conjecture within
the perturbative regime, incorporating all finite $N$ corrections on the field
theory side. Our approach involves additional key details, such as
incorporating effective 4d higher-derivative supergravity corrections to
introduce refinement. A central result is the derivation of the Airy function
representation for the squashed $S^3$ partition function of the field theory,
for an arbitrary squashing parameter. We demonstrate that this Airy function
structure is universal across all M2-brane models and provide a general
expression in terms of the equivariant volume of $X$, incorporating the mesonic
deformations corresponding to complexified masses. This expression is then
evaluated explicitly for several examples, including ABJM theory, its flavored
generalizations, circular quivers, and beyond, demonstrating agreement with the
available field theory localization results. We extend the analysis to the
superconformal and twisted indices of M2-brane models, and their spindle
generalizations, leaving their full perturbative completion for future work.
Finally, we explore avenues for generalizing these results to other brane
systems, explicitly applying the idea to D3-branes.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Notes from lectures at a conference on 3D conformal field theories using spinor and twistor methods. It covers three parts: spinor helicity, twistors, and super-twistors, with applications in double copy relations, holography, and conformal correlators. Plenty of exercises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D conformal field theories are a rich area of study with connections to higher dimensions and holography. Lecture notes on these topics provide valuable insights into their mathematical structure and applications.

Method: The notes introduce spinor helicity formalism and twistor theory, applying them to various contexts such as double copy relations, Penrose transforms, and conformal correlators. The materials are self-contained and include exercises.

Result: The lectures present a detailed development of spinor and twistor methods in 3D CFTs, demonstrating their effectiveness and extendability to super-conformal theories. The notes, along with exercises, aid in understanding these abstract concepts.

Conclusion: This lecture series effectively introduces and applies spinor and twistor methods to study 3D conformal field theories, with practical exercises enhancing comprehension.

Abstract: These notes are based on my lectures given at $\text{ST}^4$ 2025 held at
IISER Bhopal. We study the application of spinor and twistor methods to three
dimensional conformal field theories in these notes. They are divided into
three parts dealing with spinor helicity, twistors and super-twistors
respectively. In the first part, we introduce the off-shell spinor helicity
formalism and apply it in several contexts including double copy relations,
connection to four dimensional scattering amplitudes, correlators in
Chern-Simons matter theories and the holography of chiral higher spin theory.
The second part of the notes introduces the twistor space formalism. After
discussing the geometry of twistor space, we derive the Penrose transform for
conserved currents, scalars with arbitrary scaling dimension as well as generic
non-conserved operators. We also explicitly show how the spinor and twistor
approaches are related. We discuss how correlators of these operators and
conserved currents in particular drastically simplify in twistor space
unveiling their hidden simplicity. We also extend our construction to
super-conformal field theories and develop a manifest super-twistor space
formalism and derive the supersymmetric Penrose transform. We find that the
supersymmetric correlators are simple and natural generalizations of their
non-supersymmetric counterparts. The notes are made to be self-contained and
also include over $50$ exercises that illustrate the formalism.

### [55] [A Two-Gauge Field Model for Magnetoelectric Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21697)
*F. A. Barone,H. L. Oliveira,J. P. Ferreira*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A field-theoretical model combining Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields is proposed to simulate material layers with magnetoelectric properties. The model is analyzed in the context of a single planar material interface, with the goal of exploring its behavior and suggesting future extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of material interfaces is fundamental in understanding the interaction of electromagnetic fields with materials. This paper introduces a novel model combining Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields to simulate material layers with magnetoelectric properties, which could lead to advancements in material science and related fields.

Method: The authors developed a field-theoretical model that incorporates Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields. They conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis, specifically computing the exact propagator of the theory, and utilized this to investigate physical properties under various external source configurations, such as defects emulated by Chern-Simons sources in the material layer.

Result: The model presents a unique framework for studying magnetoelectric materials. The computations reveal the behavior of electromagnetic fields in the presence of material interfaces, providing insights into phenomena governed by the Chern-Simons mass and coupling constant parameters. The model's versatility is demonstrated by its potential extension to more complex configurations, highlighting its significance in advancing theoretical understanding and applications in material science.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a comprehensive field-theoretical model for studying material layers with magnetoelectric properties. By focusing on a single planar interface and exploring various external source scenarios, the model establishes a foundation for further research in understanding and predicting the behavior of such materials. The results suggest promising prospects for both theoretical exploration and practical applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a field-theoretical model designed to simulate the
presence of material layers with magnetoelectric properties. The model
comprises the standard Maxwell field coupled to a Chern-Simons field confined
to a planar layer. The electromagnetic behavior of the boundary is emulated
through the interaction between the Chern-Simons and Maxwell fields, governed
by two parameters: the Chern-Simons mass and the coupling constant between the
fields. Both parameters can be adjusted to reflect the specific properties of
different materials. We compute the exact propagator of the theory and employ
it to investigate several physical properties. Our analysis focuses on
phenomena that arise from the presence of external sources coupled to both the
Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields, considering various scenarios. In the
Chern-Simons sector, the sources emulate defects in the crystal lattice of the
material layer. The main objective of this paper is to present the proposed
model and to explore its behavior in the simple context of a single planar
material interface. We also suggest possible extensions of the model to more
general configurations.

### [56] [A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21823)
*Guglielmo Grimaldi,Matthew Headrick,Veronika E. Hubeny*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores whether the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) and Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) entropy cones coincide by introducing a new test involving Markov states. It concludes that the RT inequalities uniquely pass this test, supporting their coincidence with the HRT cone.-utilizes the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the HRT formula, and methodically evaluates the RT inequalities against a proposed test.-New evidence is provided that the RT and HRT cones are the same, along with a novel characterization of the entropy cone. This increases confidence in their equivalence in the HRT framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between the RT and HRT entropy cones is a key problem in holographic entanglement entropy. Previous evidence suggests they might be equivalent, but a new framework is needed to confirm this. By introducing a simple test using Markov states, the paper offers a fresh approach to this fundamental issue in quantum gravity and entanglement theory. This work could advance our understanding of holographic entanglement entropy and the structure of quantum spacetime.

Method: The paper employs entanglement entropy calculations using the Ryu-Takayanagi and Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formulas. It introduces a new test involving Markov states, which simplifies the evaluation of RT inequalities. Through this method, the paper systematically determines whether RT inequalities pass the test, providing new evidence for their equivalence with the HRT cone.

Result: The study finds that the RT inequalities pass the new test, and only the RT inequalities do so. This provides strong new evidence that the RT and HRT entropy cones are identical. Additionally, the results offer a completely new characterization of the entropy cone, which could lead to further insights into the nature of entanglement entropy and holography. These findings are significant because they confirm a key aspect of the holographic principle and could have implications for quantum gravity research.

Conclusion: This paper makes a substantial contribution to the understanding of entanglement entropy cones. By introducing a novel test, it provides strong evidence that the RT and HRT entropy cones are the same. The results also offer a new perspective on the structure of the entropy cone, enriching our understanding of the underlying physics and potentially opening new avenues for research in this area.

Abstract: Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula
are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the
so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently
the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those
same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant
Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has
accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this
conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that
a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to
evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly,
\emph{only} RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new
evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new
characterization of that cone.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We obtain moire quasicrystal patterns via Floquet-engineering
intralayer-atomic interactions in twisted bilayer hexagonal optical lattices of
ultracold atoms. By tracking the density wave amplitude, we partition the
dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes of
each stage in both real and momentum space. The spatial symmetry of the
patterns is intimately tied to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies.
Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing
the amplitude will facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent
emergence of rotational symmetry. Most notably, at specific parameters, a
twelve-fold (D12) moire quasicrystal pattern emerges which closely resembles
that observed in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space patterns likewise
exhibit pronounced rotational symmetry, with those in real space showing good
agreement at specific instants. The patterns obtained exhibit remarkable
sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting that this
frequency-dependent pattern formation could be exploited for quantum precision
measurement. Our findings introduce a new paradigm for investigating the
quasicrystals and their associated symmetries in ultracold atomic system.

Abstract: The physical origin of mutual friction in quantum fluids is deeply connected
to the fundamental nature of superfluidity. It stems from the interaction
between the superfluid and normal components, mediated by the dynamics of
quantized vortices that induce the exchange of momentum and energy. Despite the
complexity of these interactions, their essential features can be effectively
described by the dissipative point vortex model, an extension of classical
vortex dynamics that incorporates finite-temperature dissipation. Mutual
friction is parametrized by the longitudinal (dissipative) coefficient $\alpha$
and the transverse (reactive) coefficient $\alpha'$. Accurate measurement of
these parameters provides critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms
governing vortex motion and dissipation in quantum fluids, serving as a key
benchmark for theoretical models. In this work, we employ the dissipative point
vortex model to study how fluctuations in the initial conditions influence the
inference of $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ from the time evolution of the vortex
trajectories. Using experimentally realistic parameters, we show that
fluctuations can introduce significant biases in the extracted values of the
mutual friction coefficients. We compare our findings with recent experimental
measurements in strongly interacting atomic superfluids. Applying this analysis
to our recent experimental results allowed us to account for fluctuations in
the correct determination of $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$.

Abstract: Second-order phase transitions are characterised by critical scaling and
universality. The singular behaviour of thermodynamic quantities at the
transition, in particular, is determined by critical exponents of the
universality class of the transition. However, critical properties are also
characterised by the probability distribution of order parameter across the
transition, where non-Gaussian statistics are expected, but remain largely
unexplored. Here, making use of single-atom-resolved detection in momentum
space, we measure the full probability distribution of the amplitude of the
order parameter across a continuous phase transition in an interacting lattice
Bose gas. We find that fluctuations are captured by an effective potential --
reconstructed from the measured probability distribution by analogy with Landau
theory -- displaying a non-trivial minimum in the superfluid (ordered) phase,
which vanishes at the transition point. Additionally, we observe non-Gaussian
statistics of the order parameter near the transition, distinguished by
non-zero and oscillating high-order cumulants. We provide direct experimental
evidence that these oscillations are universal, and show numerically that they
exhibit critical scaling. Our experiments are conducted in inhomogeneous
systems, challenging the conventional understanding of criticality, which is
primarily based on homogeneous models. Our results underscore the crucial role
of order parameter statistics in probing critical phenomena and universality.

Abstract: Two-component Bose-Einstein condensates in the miscible phase can support
polarization solitary waves, known as magnetic solitons. By calculating the
interaction potential between two magnetic solitons, we elucidate the
mechanisms and conditions for the formation of bound states -- or molecules --
and support these predictions with dynamical simulations. We analytically
determine the dissociation energy of bound states consisting of two oppositely
polarized solitons and find good agreement with full numerical simulations.
Collisions between bound states -- either with other bound states or with
individual solitons -- produce intriguing dynamics. Notably, collisions between
a pair of bound states exhibit a dipole-like behavior. We anticipate that such
bound states, along with their rich collision dynamics, are within reach of
current experimental capabilities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a discrete model to determine the metabolic scaling exponent based
on Fibonacci growth patterns and discrete biological development phases. In
contrast to continuous fractal models such as the West-Brown-Enquist (WBE)
theory, the present approach describes metabolic scaling as the cumulative
result of successive discrete stages, each incrementally contributing to
metabolic activity. The scaling exponent b(n) emerges naturally from the
logarithmic relationship between consecutive Fibonacci numbers, varying
systematically with the organism's developmental stage. A refined logarithmic
formulation significantly enhances quantitative agreement with empirical
metabolic data across various mammalian species. This discrete framework
effectively captures deviations from classical scaling laws, directly
connecting recursive hierarchical structures with metabolic processes. Our
model provides an alternative to traditional fractal transport approaches and
can be naturally extended to hierarchical physical systems, opening new avenues
to explore stage-dependent scaling phenomena in complex adaptive systems.

Abstract: The realization of quantum transport effects at elevated temperatures has
long intrigued researchers due to the implications for unveiling novel physics
and developing quantum devices. In this work, we report remarkable quantum
linear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high
temperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high
fields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first
Landau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau
quantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority
carriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity,
allowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between
the LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR
originates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit,
firstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago.
This study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals
an innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR,
fundamentally distinct from previous findings. Our results bridge a gap in the
understanding of phonon-mediated quantum-limit physics and establish strong
magnetic fields at high temperatures as a promising platform for exploring
novel quantum phenomena.

TL;DR: 研究分析中发现，使用纯Co、Ni、Fe作为参考层的自旋磁夹层能够通过单个超短脉冲激光触发磁化反转。与变化的参考层材料和厚度导致的平面磁化失真的问题相悖，实验设计采用了平面磁化的自旋磁夹层。结果表明，对于Co、Ni和Fe，分别观察到了反向和平行磁化的切换。然而只有Co作为参考层时，才会发生反向平行的磁化反转，而Ni和Fe则不会。这种差异归因于参考材料的超快速自旋磁化动力学特性。实验结果支持了这种设想：平行到反向的磁化反转要求参考层的快速重磁化，这种重磁化会生成一个显著的负自旋电流，其方向与自由层的磁化方向相反，这是触发其反转的关键条件。

Conclusion: 实验结果支持了平行到反向的磁化反转必须依赖于参考层材料的快速重磁化机制的假设。这为理解自旋磁夹层在高强度磁场下的行为以及设计更高效的自旋电子学器件提供了理论依据。在进一步的研究中，可以探索如何通过调整参考层的材料和结构来控制磁化反转过程，以实现更高效的自旋电子学应用。

Abstract: We investigate the magnetization reversal process induced by a single
femtosecond laser pulse in ferromagnetic spin valves by systematically
comparing reference layers composed of pure Co, Ni, and Fe. To circumvent the
loss of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy associated with changes in reference
layer material and thickness, we design spin valves with in plane
magnetizations. While antiparallel to parallel switching is observed for all
three elements, parallel to antiparallel switching occurs only with a Co
reference layer and is absent with Ni and Fe. This difference is attributed to
the distinct ultrafast magnetization dynamics of the reference materials. Our
results support the hypothesis that parallel to antiparallel switching requires
a rapid remagnetization of the reference layer, which generates a substantial
negative spin current polarized opposite to the free layer magnetization an
essential condition for triggering its reversal.

*Y. del Castillo,A. Ferrón,J. Fernández-Rossier*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discusses the remote manipulation of edge fractional spins in Haldane spin chains using a weak local perturbation and demonstrates the ability to induce strong changes in magnetization on the opposite edge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is likely the quest for understanding and controlling quantum spin states in low-dimensional systems, particularly in the context of quantum information processing and quantum computing.

Method: The authors employ a combination of analytical derivations and theoretical modeling. They derive an effective four-level model to describe the response of local magnetization to perturbations and utilize the Landau-Zener protocol to demonstrate adiabatic control of spin states.

Result: The key result is that applying a small local field on one edge of the spin chain can lead to a significant variation in magnetization on the opposite edge. Additionally, the Landau-Zener protocol enables the adiabatic switching of magnetization direction through local perturbation.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for engineering robust and controllable quantum states in spin chain systems, which could have implications for quantum information storage and processing systems.

Abstract: We consider the remote manipulation of the quantum state of the edge
fractional spins of Haldane spin chains using a weak local perturbation on the
other edge. We derive an effective four-level model that correctly captures the
response of the local magnetization to local perturbations and we use it to
show that applying a small local field on one edge of the chain induces a
strong variation of the magnetization on the opposite edge. Using a
Landau-Zener protocol, we show how local control of the field on one edge of
the chain, implemented for instance with a spin-polarized scanning tunnel
microscope tip, can adiabatically switch the magnetization direction on the
other side of the chain.

Conclusion: Pioneers a powerful non-invasive technique for studying dynamic phenomena in exotic materials and quantum circuits.

Abstract: Studying nanoscale dynamics is essential for understanding quantum materials
and advancing quantum chip manufacturing. Still, it remains a major challenge
to measure non-equilibrium properties such as current and dissipation, and
their relation to structure. Scanning nanoprobes utilizing superconducting
quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are uniquely suited here, due to their
unparalleled magnetic and thermal sensitivity. Here, we introduce tapping-mode
SQUID-on-tip, which combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) with nanoSQUID
sensing. Our probes minimize nanoSQUID-sample distance, provide in-plane
magnetic sensitivity, and operate without lasers. Frequency multiplexing
enables simultaneous imaging of currents, magnetism, dissipation and
topography. The large voltage output of our proximity-junction nanoSQUIDs
allows us to resolve nanoscale currents as small as 100 nA using a simple
four-probe electronic readout without cryogenic amplification. By capturing
local magnetic, thermal, and electronic response without external radiation,
our technique offers a powerful non-invasive route to study dynamic phenomena
in exotic materials and delicate quantum circuits.

Abstract: Fast spin manipulation and long spin coherence time in quantum dots are
essential features for high fidelity semiconductor spin qubits. However,
generally it has not been well established how to optimize these two properties
simultaneously, because these two properties are usually not independent from
each other. Therefore, the scheme for high fidelity operation by simultaneous
tuning Rabi frequency and coherence time, which does not rely on the
material-dependent strong spin-orbit interaction and the local magnetic field
gradient limiting their scalability, are strongly demanded. Here, we
demonstrate an approach to achieve high-fidelity spin control by tuning
inter-dot spin-orbit coupling in a GaAs triple quantum dot (TQD), where the
third dot provides precise control over orbital energy levels. In an
electrically stable charge state with optimized tunnel coupling, we achieve
Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz while maintaining coherence through proper
tuning of the inter-dot orbital levels of the TQD. By implementing a machine
learning-based feedback control that efficiently estimates qubit frequency
using past measurement data, we characterize and mitigate the impact of low
frequency noise on qubit coherence with minimal measurement overhead. Finally,
we demonstrate a $\pi$/2 gate fidelity of 99.7\% with a gate time of 4 ns
through randomized benchmarking, even in a GaAs quantum dot device where
electron spin coherence is typically limited by strong hyperfine interaction
with nuclear spins. Our approach provides a scalable strategy for high-fidelity
spin control in semiconductor quantum dot arrays by utilizing device-specific
parameters rather than relying on material properties or external field
gradients.

Abstract: Exploring the synergy between topological physics and nonlinear dynamics
unveils profound insights into emergent states of matter. Inspired by recent
experimental demonstrations of topological frequency combs in photonics, we
theoretically introduce topological magnon frequency combs (MFCs) in a
two-dimensional triangular skyrmion lattice. Computing the Chern numbers of
magnon bands reveals robust chiral edge states. Strikingly, these topological
MFCs originate from nonlinear four-magnon scattering among the chiral edge
modes, activated by dual-frequency driving without an amplitude threshold. Comb
spacings are readily tunable through excitation frequency detuning.
Micromagnetic simulations validate our predictions with good concordance. This
work paves the way for defect-immune magnonic devices exploiting MFCs and
sparks investigations into topological-nonlinear phenomena in magnetic systems.

Abstract: The concept of cloaking -- hiding objects from external detection -- has seen
wide success in linear systems. Yet, translating these advancements to
nonlinear mechanical systems remains an open challenge. Here, we present a new
approach to nonlinear mechanical cloaking that frames cloaking as an
optimization problem aimed at replicating a target mechanical response. We
solve this problem using a differentiable simulation framework coupled with
gradient-based optimization. We implement this approach in a class of
mechanical metamaterials constructed from rigid units with elastic couplings
that support large deformation and contact interactions. Using both numerical
simulations and physical experiments, we design optimal cloak structures that
effectively mask internal inhomogeneities and shield against external
mechanical disturbances both in static and dynamic regimes. This approach
provides a versatile design paradigm for creating mechanical systems with
integrated cloaking functionality across a broad range of loading scenarios.

Abstract: Small-size magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR) represent an emerging class of
passive, wireless sensors that combine a sensing functionality with a tracking
option. The operation principle is based on a resonating rotor oscillation
whose frequency is defined by the magnetic flux density of a stator magnet. One
general sensing mechanism is the coupling of an external parameter to this
resonator frequency. In this study, we investigate an approach for encoding a
temperature information as a shift in the natural oscillation frequency
utilizing the temperature-dependent magnetic properties of gadolinium (Gd). We
perform an isolated simulation study on the temperature scaling of the magnetic
field generation for stators coated with Gd of varying thickness. Our results
show that the magnetic phase transition of Gd at its Curie temperature leads to
a pronounced change in the magnetic permeability enabling a significant
magnetic shielding behavior only for lower temperatures. In the transition
regime, we find a peak sensitivity reaching 45.8 Hz/K exceeding existing values
from the literature by up to a factor of $\sim$ 20. The findings of this work
are an important step toward quantitative high-sensitivity temperature
extraction with MMRs.

Abstract: Perpendicular switching of a ferromagnet induced by spin torques is crucial
for building high density spin-based memory and logic devices, where
out-of-plane spin polarization ($\sigma_z$) has become a long sought-after goal
for deterministic switching without assisted magnetic fields. Here we report
the observation of$\sigma_z$ and resultant field-free perpendicular switching
in a single ferromagnet without any spin torque generation layers, where
$\sigma_z$ is achieved through the self-generated spin polarization in the
ferromagnet that is engineered by the N\'eel order of an adjacent
antiferromagnetic insulator. We further demonstrated that $\sigma_z$ emerges
when the self-generated spin polarization is collinear with the N\'eel vector,
where the spin current is reflected back to the ferromagnet, along with rotated
spin polarization toward the out-of-plane direction to induce $\sigma_z$. Since
no current is shunted by antiferromagnetic insulators and the N\'eel order does
not rely on single-crystalline materials, these results may provide a
CMOS-compatible solution for constructing energy-efficient field-free
spintronic devices.

Motivation: APL researchers exploring XMPI for streaming fluid dynamics and materials deformation monitoring.

Method: Split X-ray beam into parallel beamlets using optics; beamlets intersect sample for simultaneous projection.

Result: 12.5 kHz, 4 µm/pixel (fibers); 40 Hz, 1.3 µm/pixel (multi-phase flows).

Conclusion: XMPI opens new APL forecasting capabilities at ForMAX, permanently accessible XMPI setup planned.

Abstract: X-rays are commonly used in imaging experiments due to their penetration
power, which enables non-destructive resolution of internal structures in
samples that are opaque to visible light. Time-resolved X-ray tomography is the
state-of-the-art method for obtaining volumetric 4D (3D + time) information by
rotating the sample and acquiring projections from different angular viewpoints
over time. This method enables studies to address a plethora of research
questions across various scientific disciplines. However, it faces several
limitations, such as incompatibility with single-shot experiments, challenges
in rotating complex sample environments that restrict the achievable rotation
speed or range, and the introduction of centrifugal forces that can affect the
sample's dynamics. These limitations can hinder and even preclude the study of
certain dynamics. Here, we present an implementation of an alternative
approach, X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), which eliminates the need for
sample rotation. Instead, the direct incident X-ray beam is split into beamlets
using beam splitting X-ray optics. These beamlets intersect at the sample
position from different angular viewpoints, allowing multiple projections to be
acquired simultaneously. We commissioned this setup at the ForMAX beamline at
MAX IV. We present projections acquired from two different sample systems -
fibers under mechanical load and particle suspension in multi-phase flow - with
distinct spatial and temporal resolution requirements. We demonstrate the
capabilities of the ForMAX XMPI setup using the detector's full dynamical range
for the relevant sample-driven spatiotemporal resolutions: i) at least 12.5 kHz
framerates with 4 micrometer pixel sizes (fibers) and ii) 40 Hz acquisitions
with 1.3 micrometer pixel sizes (multi-phase flows), setting the basis for a
permanent XMPI endstation at ForMAX.

Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising materials
for next-generation optoelectronic devices, owing to their strong excitonic
responses and atomic thickness. Controlling their light emission electrically
is a crucial step towards realizing practical nanoscale optoelectronic devices
such as light-emitting diodes and optical modulators. However,
photoluminescence (PL) quenching in van der Waals TMDC/metal heterostructures,
caused by ultrafast interlayer charge or energy transfer, impedes such
electrical modulation. Here, we investigate monolayer-MoSe2/bulk-NbSe2
heterostructures and demonstrate that a vertical electric field can effectively
recover the PL intensity up to ~ 80% of bare-MoSe2. Furthermore, our analysis
reveals that the room temperature PL intensity can be tuned by nearly three
orders of magnitude in bare-MoSe2 and by about one order of magnitude in
MoSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures. First-principles calculations incorporating
spin-orbit coupling reveal that the perpendicular electric fields drive a
transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap, fundamentally altering the
optical response in the heterostructure. Unlike bare-MoSe2, the heterostructure
exhibits a pronounced thermal dependence of the enhancement factor, implying
that exciton lifetime dominates over interfacial transfer processes. Our
findings demonstrate reversible, electric-field-driven PL control at a
TMDC/metal interface, providing a pathway to electrically tunable light
emission and improved contact engineering in two-dimensional optoelectronic
devices.

Motivation: Advancing quantum chemistry and materials science through capturing complex electronic behavior.

Method: Combines MCSCF with VQE, validated through benchmarks on water, graphene interactions, and metal graphene complexes.

Result: Chemically accurate predictions for larger systems, such as metal graphene.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches offer a practical route toward quantum advantage in NISQ era applications.

Abstract: Understanding strongly correlated systems is essential for advancing quantum
chemistry and materials science, yet conventional methods like Density
Functional Theory (DFT) often fail to capture their complex electronic
behavior. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that integrates Multiconfigurational Self Consistent Field (MCSCF)
with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our initial benchmarks on water
dissociation enabled the systematic optimization of key computational
parameters, including ansatz selection, active space construction, and error
mitigation. Building on this, we extend our approach to investigate the
interactions between graphene analogues and water, demonstrating that our
framework produces binding energies consistent with high accuracy quantum
methods. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to predict the binding energies
of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) on both pristine and defective graphene
analogues, revealing strong charge transfer effects and pronounced
multireference character phenomena often misrepresented by standard DFT. In
contrast to many existing quantum algorithms that are constrained to small
molecular systems, our framework achieves chemically accurate predictions for
larger, strongly correlated systems such as metal graphene complexes. This
advancement highlights the capacity of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to
address complex electronic interactions and demonstrates a practical route
toward realizing quantum advantage for real world materials applications in the
Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

TL;DR: Convex Hartree-Fock is proposed as an efficient method for modeling conical intersections, with advantages over time-dependent Hartree-Fock.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of conical intersections is crucial for understanding nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and related phenomena like radiationless transitions and photochemical reactions.

Method: Convex Hartree-Fock modifies the reference in the Hartree-Fock framework by optimizing within a tailored subspace, removing projections along selected Hessian eigenvectors, and then performing Hamiltonian diagonalization for both ground and excited states.

Result: The method shows promise across several test cases and outperforms time-dependent Hartree-Fock within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation.

Conclusion: Convex Hartree-Fock provides an efficient alternative for modeling conical intersections, leveraging the strengths of Hartree-Fock while addressing its limitations.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of conical intersections is crucial in nonadiabatic
molecular dynamics, as these features govern processes such as radiationless
transitions and photochemical reactions. Conventional electronic structure
methods, including Hartree-Fock, density functional theory, and their
time-dependent extensions, struggle in this regime. Due to their single
reference nature and separate treatment of ground and excited states, they fail
to capture ground state intersections. Multiconfigurational approaches overcome
these limitations, but at a prohibitive computational cost. In this work, we
propose a modified Hartree-Fock framework, referred to as Convex Hartree-Fock,
that optimizes the reference within a tailored subspace by removing projections
along selected Hessian eigenvectors. The ground and excited states are then
obtained through subsequent Hamiltonian diagonalization. We validate the
approach across several test cases and benchmark its performance against
time-dependent Hartree-Fock within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation.

Abstract: Singlet Fission (SF) into two triplets offers exciting avenues for
high-efficiency photovoltaics and optically initializable qubits. While the
chemical space of SF chromophores is ever-expanding, the mechanistic details of
electronic-nuclear motions that dictate the photophysics are unclear. Rigid SF
dimers with well-defined orientations are necessary to decipher such details.
Here, using polarization-controlled white-light two-dimensional and pump-probe
spectroscopies, we investigate a new class of contorted naphthalenediimide
dimers, recently reported to have a favorable intramolecular SF (iSF) pathway.
2D cross-peaks between the two Davydov components and strongly
wavelength-dependent TT1 formation kinetics together implicate a coherently
coupled excimer-like intermediate. Enhanced quantum beats in the TT1
photoproduct suggest that inter-chromophore twisting and ruffling motions drive
the ~200 fs evolution towards excimer-like intermediate and the subsequent ~2
ps relaxation to the TT1 photoproduct. Polarization anisotropy directly tracks
electronic motion during these steps and reveals surprisingly minimal
electronic reorientation with significant singlet-triplet mixing throughout the
nuclear evolution away from the Franck-Condon geometry towards relaxed TT1. The
combination of white-light 2DES and polarization anisotropy experiments
presented here lends powerful insights for refinement of the existing

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强磁场对旋转黑洞引力透镜效应的影响。

Method: 利用Kerr-Newman度量研究带磁场的旋转黑洞。

Result: 磁场增强导致引力透镜效应变化显著，特别是M87*和Sgr A*的观测特征有明显差异。

Conclusion: 磁场对旋转黑洞的引力透镜效应有显著影响，可用于测量黑洞磁性和自旋。

Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing using magnetized Kerr black holes
(MKBHs), which are accurate Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson solutions for Kerr black
holes in a uniform magnetic field with additional magnetic field strength $B$
apart from mass $M$ and spin $a$. Unlike previous magnetized spacetimes, the
MKBH geometry is Petrov type D, devoid of conical singularities, allowing
photons to reach asymptotic infinity and making the concept astrophysically
feasible. We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon
sphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing
observables including the image position $\theta_\infty$, angular separation
$s$ and relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships
with the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic
image's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing
observables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with
$a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from
$10.8~\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two
images increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*,
the image position increases from $14.4~\mu$as to $16~\mu$as, with time delays
enhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification
$r_{\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at
$B=0.4$. Our findings highlight strong gravitational lensing as a powerful tool
to probe the presence of magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes, and
in particular, we demonstrate that the MKBH spacetime enables constraints on
the parameters $a$ and $B$.

*Antonio Pasqua*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines two corrected holographic dark energy models in a universe with viscous DE interacting with DM, analyzing their EoS parameter, deceleration parameter, and energy density evolution for both correction types and comparing them with several scalar field models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring dark energy models using different corrections to the holographic principle could provide deeper insights into cosmological acceleration and the interaction between dark energy and dark matter.

Method: Non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe model, viscous dark energy-dark matter interaction, Ricci scalar curvature cutoff, entropy corrections applied to dark energy density, and model comparisons using generalized Chaplygin gas and other scalar field models.

Result: Results suggest that both the logarithmic and power-law corrected Ricci dark energy models correspond well with alternative scalar field dark energy models, supporting their viability as dark energy candidates.

Conclusion: The analysis supports the use of Ricci dark energy corrections in modeling interacting dark energy scenarios and aligns with various dark energy scalar field models, advancing our understanding of dark energy dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the logarithmic-corrected and the power-law
corrected versions of the holographic dark energy (HDE) model in the non-flat
FRW universe filled with a viscous Dark Energy (DE) interacting with Dark
Matter (DM). We propose to replace the infra-red cut-off with the inverse of
the Ricci scalar curvature $R$. We obtain the equation of state (EoS) parameter
$\omega_{\Lambda}$, the deceleration parameter $q$ and the evolution of energy
density parameter $\omega_{\Lambda} '$
  in the presence of interaction between DE and DM for both corrections. We
study the correspondence of the power-law entropy corrected Ricci dark energy
(PLECRDE) and the logarithmic entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (LECRDE)
models with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), the Modified Variable
Chaplygin Gas (MVCG), the New Modified Chaplygin Gas (NMCG), the Yang-Mills
(YM) and the Non Linear Electro-Dynamics (NLED) scalar field models.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines how the formation history of black hole binaries influences the distribution of dark matter surrounding them, specifically affecting the detection of gravitational waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of dark matter in gravitational wave detection is important for studying extreme astrophysical systems.

Method: The authors model the binary system's evolution and the dynamics of dark matter particles, incorporating factors like angular momentum and prior mergers.

Result: Introducing a minimum angular momentum for dark matter reduces dephasing of gravitational waves, especially for extreme mass ratios. Prior mergers also affect these effects.

Conclusion: The study shows that dark matter distributions can be measured by future detectors, offering new insights into these complex systems.

Abstract: Recent work has shown the possibility of detecting dense dark-matter
distributions surrounding intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals through
gravitational waves using LISA. Modeling these systems requires evolving the
coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting
reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself
relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this
paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories
shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger
events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of
dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been
accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a
distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from
a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly
for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place
within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find
that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior
inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the
environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial
data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Loop quantum gravity predicts a minimum area for black holes, which we confirm using a covariant effective model, showing these remnants stabilize in the Planck regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole remnants and their thermodynamic properties is crucial for reconciling quantum gravity with general relativity.

Method: A covariant effective model for spherical loop quantum gravity is used to describe quasi-static, nonsingular black hole evaporation.

Result: Black holes evaporate to leave stable remnants with masses around 20.94μg in the Planck regime.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity, suggesting remnants stabilize in the Planck scale regime.

Abstract: The quantized area predicted by loop quantum gravity suggests the existence
of a lower bound for black-hole horizons. We prove this intuition within a
covariant effective model for spherical loop quantum gravity, where nonsingular
quasi-static black holes evaporate until their horizons attain the smallest
positive eigenvalue of the area operator. Consistent with the third law of
black-hole thermodynamics, this final state -- characterized by vanishing
temperature and entropy -- cannot be realized in finite time. The process thus
leads to the formation of stable remnants, whose estimated masses are
approximately 20.94$\mu$g, lying in the Planck regime.

Result: 对于不旋转的系统，低阶振荡模式的振幅在合并过程中能较好地符合PN展开的主导行为，而更高阶的模式在合并附近表现出不同的行为。对于旋转的系统，在合并附近，振荡模式的振幅表现出较强的相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解双黑洞合并过程中的引力波振荡模式提供了新的见解，并为后续的多项式拟合方法提供了改进的方向。这些结果有助于提高对引力波信号的建模和分析能力。

Abstract: We analyze the spherical harmonic mode amplitudes of quasi-circular,
nonprecessing binary black hole mergers using 283 numerical relativity (NR)
simulations from the SXS, RIT, and MAYA catalogs. We construct fits using the
leading-order post-Newtonian (PN) dependence on intrinsic parameters, replacing
the PN velocity with fit coefficients. We compare these to polynomial fits in
symmetric mass ratio and spin. We analyze $(\ell, m)$ modes with $\ell \leq 4$
from late inspiral ($t = -500M$ relative to the $(2,2)$ peak) to post-merger
($t = 40M$). For nonspinning systems, the $(2,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,3)$ modes
retain the leading-order PN dependence on mass ratio throughout the merger.
Higher-order modes deviate from the PN dependence only near and after the
merger, where polynomial fits of degree $N \leq 3$ can capture the amplitude
behavior up to $40M$. For aligned-spin systems at fixed mass ratio, the $(2,1)$
mode retains its PN spin dependence, while the $(3,2)$ and $(4,3)$ modes
exhibit a quadratic spin dependence near merger. The PN-inspired fits lose
accuracy with increasing mass ratio, particularly near merger. Results broadly
agree across catalogs, though discrepancies appear in the $(3,1)$, $(4,2)$, and
$(4,1)$ modes, likely from resolution differences. Our results clarify the
extent to which PN structure persists in mode amplitudes and show that simple
polynomial models can capture strong-field behavior near merger, enabling
efficient and interpretable waveform modeling in this regime.

Abstract: We carry out model independent analyses for global structures of spherically
symmetric regular black holes that evaporate and approach the extremal state
spending infinite periods of time due to Hawking radiation.
  We assume the radius of the outer apparent horizon (outer AH) to be a
decreasing function of ingoing null coordinate, and consider the three cases,
Cases 1, 2, and 3, where the radius of the inner AH is a constant, increases,
and decreases, respectively.
  A complete classification of the Penrose diagrams is presented in each case,
taking account not only of the presence and absence of the event horizon but
also of the relative positions of the inner and outer AHs.
  Sufficient conditions that lead to each type are proved, and the examples of
each type are summarized.
  We also study the behavior of outgoing null geodesics in models where the
null geodesic equation is solvable, and figure out the important factors to
determine the type of a spacetime using concepts in the area of dynamical
systems.
  The formation of a Cauchy horizon is also established in the solvable models
when the event horizon is present.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel framework to investigate ringdown
gravitational waveforms in the presence of dynamical matter fields outside the
horizon of a black hole. We systematically analyze two distinct scenarios of
dynamical matter fields: motion along geodesics and uniform motion with
constant velocity. Our results reveal rich phenomenology in the ringdown
gravitational wave signals, including the suppression or enhancement of echoes,
frequency shifts in the decay oscillations, and intricate modulations of the
power-law tails. Notably, we demonstrate that subluminal moving potentials can
produce irregular echo patterns and shift the dominant frequencies, offering
potential new observational signatures beyond the already-known ringdown
analyses. This study provides a new perspective for probing dynamic
environments around black holes and offers a theoretical foundation for
interpreting possible deviations in future gravitational wave detections.

Abstract: We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically
symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in
a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and
precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave
dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by
analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon
structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic
fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma
environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles
and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and
power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical
settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of
the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's
method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave
equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB
approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and
examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we
perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to
constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT
and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a
unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with
lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future
comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.

Abstract: We explore the features of a thick braneworld model in five dimensions
governed by a Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a non-minimal coupling to a
dynamical scalar field. We consider two possible scalar-GB coupling function
$\chi(\phi)$, one parity-even and another parity-odd function of the scalar
field $\phi$. For both choices, the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet non-minimal coupling
produces a warped asymptotically $AdS_5$ spacetime even in the absence of a
bulk cosmological constant. Outside the brane core, a negative cosmological
constant is bounded by the scalar-GB coupling function. For a thick 3-brane
configuration, we found solutions with localized brane energy density and
pressure that dynamically produce a bulk cosmological constant. The
corresponding scalar field solutions exhibit a non-topological (domain wall)
behavior. In order to probe the 3-brane stability solution, we employed a
perturbative analysis, by perturbing the thick brane solutions up to
first-order. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) tensorial gravitational modes possess a
localized massless mode and a tower of non-tachyonic diverging massive modes,
what renders the solutions stable at least at the perturbative level.

TL;DR: 研究 Highlights：引力常数变化对引力波传播的影响。纯理论分析得出，引力常数变化的零阶效应主要影响引力波幅度，一阶效应则主要影响相位。由于引力波数据分析使用匹配滤波技术，相位比幅度更重要。当前论文利用LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA数据对引力常数变化进行约束。研究发现，随着引力波事件的天文学距离增加或信号-to-noise比提高，达到当前状态的2n个数量级时，需要用相位校正来约束|G'/G|<10^{-n}/yr的引力波事件无电磁伴随。当引力波事件有电磁伴随时，相位校正几乎可以忽略不计来约束G'/G。

Result: 纯理论分析结果：零阶效应影响幅度，一阶效应影响相位。实验结果：当引力波事件的天文学距离增加或信噪比提高时，相位校正对约束|G'/G|的精度至关重要。当引力波事件有电磁伴随时，相位校正几乎可以忽略不计。
对于无电磁伴随的引力波事件，只有当两者提升到所需数量级时才能进行有效的相位校正约束。
对于具有电磁伴随的引力波事件，可以有效地通过仅根据相位信息进行相位校正，而无需幅度信息。

Conclusion: 研究总结：引力常数变化主要影响相位信息。为了对|G'/G|进行精确约束，需要随着引力波事件的天文学距离增加或信噪比提高到所需数量级。对于无电磁伴随的引力波事件，未来更高灵敏度的引力波检测将有助于进一步约束引力常数变化参数。对于具有电磁伴随的引力波事件，目前的相位信息足以进行相位校正约束，这意味着引力常数变化的约束是为了未来引力波天文学的发展。这为后续研究引力常数变异对引力波传播的具体影响提供了重要的理论和技术基础。

Abstract: We have previously investigated the effect of the gravitational constant
variation on the gravitational wave propagation. Pure theoretical analysis
indicates that the leading order effect of the gravitational constant variation
corrects the amplitude of gravitational waves, and the second order effect
corrects the phase of gravitational waves. As the matched filtering technique
is used by gravitational wave data analysis, the phase is more important than
the amplitude. In the current paper we use LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA data to constrain
the gravitational constant variation. Our findings indicate that we need to
wait until the distance of the detected gravitational wave events and/or the
signal-to-noise ratio increases by $2n$ orders compared to the current
detection state, and then we can use phase correction to get constraint
$|\frac{G'}{G}|<10^{-n}$/yr for gravitational wave events without
electromagnetic counterparts. For gravitational wave events with
electromagnetic counterparts which provide the information of source's
luminosity distance, the phase correction can almost always be neglected to
constrain $\frac{G'}{G}$.

Abstract: Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the
existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert
space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that
are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or
spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All
unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary.
Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate
from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required
Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and
spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting
materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum
many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One
of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made
the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results
in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We
confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and
topological nodal-line states in square-net materials. Our Ginzburg-Landau
theory predicts a CDW instability that generically opens a gap at the Fermi
energy while preserving the nodal line crossing. However, as the Fermi level
approaches the nodal line, the density of states at the nodal line decreases,
eventually disappearing as the CDW vector $\mathbf{Q}$ goes to zero. Exactly at
$\mathbf{Q} = 0$, the order parameter explicitly breaks the glide symmetry
protecting the nodal line, which allows a gap to open. Yet, for small but
finite $\mathbf{Q}$, the nodal line may vanish within experimental resolution
even when the glide symmetry is preserved. Our results provide a consistent
explanation for recent experimental observations.

### [92] [Displacement-Field-Driven Transition between Superconductivity and Valley Ferromagnetism in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21119)
*Hyeok-Jun Yang,Yi-Ting Hsu*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Summary: A paper discusses how a displacement field $D$ induces transitions between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ systems near van-Hove fillings. The mechanism is explained using a VHS-only model and renormalization group techniques, predicting a chiral d/p-wave superconductivity phase for weak $D$ and a valley ferromagnetic phase for strong $D$. Experiments are proposed to test these predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is an experimental paper that discusses transitions between superconductivity and correlated magnetism in semiconductor materials. The investigation is important for understanding the interplay between electronic structure and magnetic properties, which could lead to new materials with technologically useful properties.

Method: The theoretical framework used is a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical models, including the use of van-Hove singularities (VHS) and renormalization group techniques. The model developed is based on a VHS-only model with a screened Coulomb interaction, which is then solved using renormalization group techniques beyond the mean-field level. Approximations are made in the treatment of the model, but the approach is exact within the model's framework.

Result: The main results of this paper are that a displacement field introduces a mechanism to induce first a chiral d/p-wave superconducting state, and then a valley ferromagnetic state once the displacement beyond a critical value is reached. The critical value for displacement field $D_c$ is determined, and it is shown that the transition is a continuous phase transition. The paper also proposes several experiments to detect these phases, such as measuring the Hall conductivity, magnetoresistance, and superconducting gap structure.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper provides a theoretical framework explaining how a displacement field can drive phase transitions between different magnetic and superconducting states in certain hexagonal van der Waals materials. The work opens possibilities for exploring new phases of matter and discovering novel materials with interesting electronic properties. The ability to engineer such phases could have implications for future electronic and spintronic devices.

Abstract: Recent experiments have observed transitions between superconductivity and
correlated magnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ near van-Hove fillings, driven
by the displacement field $D$. Motivated by the experiment, we theoretically
propose a general mechanism for a $D$-controlled transition between
superconductivity and ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit-coupled
hexagonal systems, where van Hove singularities (VHS) lie on the Fermi level.
We show that such a transition can be naturally captured by a simple VHS-only
model without Fermi surface details, where the inter-VHS interactions that
govern the Fermi surface instabilities is controlled by $D$ through the band
projection of screened Coulomb interaction. By treating this simple model with
renormalization group technique beyond mean-field level, we find that a chiral
$d/p$-wave superconductivity naturally dominates under a weak displacement
field $D<D_c$. At a stronger displacement field $D>D_c$, a \textit{valley
ferromagnetic phase} (vFM) takes over, which is spatially non-uniform due to
valley-modulated magnetization. Finally, we discuss generic conditions for the
predicted superconductivity-to-ferromagnetism transition to take place in the
rich family of few-layer hexagonal van der Waals material systems. Taking
twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a case study, we discuss experimental detections
that can falsify our prediction.

TL;DR: Striates with involutionary symmetry exhibit topological superconductivity in flavor-polarized, flat-band graphene, governed by parity-polarized fermions with attractive interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observing superconductivity in flat-band graphene introduces models to understand its mechanism.

Method: Invokes Fermi surface topology, Bloch oscillations, and attractive interactions to deduce pairing symmetry.

Result: Flat-band superconductivity is topological when parent FB is topological, achieved through competing pairing modes and quantum geometry.

Conclusion: Flat bands enable exotic superconducting states in graphene, contingent on flavor polarization and interaction strength.

Abstract: Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of
superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral
graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for
single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive
interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact
superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to
realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main
effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly
attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The
nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum
geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is
so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes,
whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap
between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular
momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different
topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the
attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational
upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the
maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry
in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.

Abstract: The quantum many-electron problem is not just at the heart of condensed
matter phenomena, but also essential for first-principles simulation of
chemical phenomena. Strong correlation in chemical systems are prevalent and
present a formidable challenge in the simulation of these systems, while
predictive phenomena in this domain often also requires a demanding level of
accuracy to inform chemical behavior. Efficient representations of the
many-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by
machine learning principles to provide an alternative to established
approaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for
quantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the
particular challenges present in this field. In particular, we focus on the
application of Gaussian Process States emerging from efficient representations
of the many-body wavefunction with rigorous Bayesian modeling frameworks,
allowing for the unification of multiple paradigms under a common umbrella. We
show how such models (and other representations derived from machine learning)
can be used as novel tools to compute ab initio chemical properties, while in
turn also informing the design of machine learning models to extract
correlation patterns in classical data.

Abstract: We investigate the dispersions of anyon quasi-particles in the Kitaev
honeycomb spin-liquid perturbed by $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings in order to
understand phase transitions into competing states through anyon gap-closing
instabilities. We demonstrate how anyon gap closings allow to understand phase
transitions into a plethora of previously identified competing phases --
including zigzag, stripy, $120^\circ$, and incommensurate spiral phases -- and
are in agreement with numerical studies not only on the nature of the phases,
but also on the specific critical values of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings.
Remarkably, when the anti-ferromagnetic Kitaev model is perturbed by an
ferromagnetic $\Gamma$ interaction, we find that the single-vison and fermion
gaps remain open while the gap of a magnon-like local boson vanishes, implying
that the resulting state has coexistence of a spontaneous broken symmetry and
the fractionalization pattern of the Kitaev spin liquid. The magnetic
long-range order could be either a stripy antiferromagnet or an incommensurate
spiral, depending on the sign of $\Gamma'$.

Abstract: In ordered quantum magnets where interactions between elementary excitations
dominate over their kinetic energy, perturbative approaches often fail, making
non-perturbative methods essential to capture spectral features such as bound
states and the redistribution of weight within excitation continua. Although an
increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in
such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here,
we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in
its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches:
exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary
excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside
cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the
presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering
continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from
hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum.
Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum,
enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED
provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation
continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its
combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool
for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes.

Abstract: Spin waves are the fundamental excitations in magnetically ordered spin
systems and are ubiquitously observed in magnetic materials. However, the
standard understanding of spin waves as collective spin oscillations in an
effective harmonic potential does not consider the possibility of soft modes,
such as those due to an effective quartic potential. In this work, we show that
such quartic potentials arise under very general conditions in a broad class of
isotropic spin systems without a fine-tuning of the interaction parameters.
Considering models with spin spiral ground states in two and three spatial
dimensions, we numerically demonstrate that quartic amplitude spin oscillations
produce a fluctuation-induced spin-wave gap which grows with temperature
according to a characteristic power-law. In conjunction with a phenomenological
theory, the present work provides a general theoretical framework for
describing soft spin modes, extending the previously discussed spin dynamics in
the presence of order-by-disorder, and highlighting the important role of
finite-size effects. Our predictions of a temperature-dependent gap in spiral
spin systems could be tested in inelastic neutron scattering experiments,
providing direct spectroscopic evidence for thermal effects arising from soft
spin modes in magnetic materials.

Abstract: Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their
kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice
lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band
topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the
characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at
$E_F$ in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]$^{2+}$: 2e-. In this system,
excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an
interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our
ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in
YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The flat bands
and other dispersive bands observed in ARPES find excellent agreement with
first-principles calculations, and theoretical analysis reveals that the
near-$E_F$ electronic structure is well captured by a simple dice-lattice
model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material
and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results
further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for
realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in
conventional crystalline systems.

Abstract: We theoretically study the role of electron-electron interactions in
one-dimensional magnetized helical states coupled to an s-wave superconductor.
We consider a partially mixed helical (superhelical) regime, where the magnetic
field (superconductivity) has a dominant contribution. Using bosonization and
renormalization group techniques, it is shown how the interactions affect the
correlation functions in the system. In the partially mixed helical regime, we
find that superconducting pairing promotes spin-density-wave correlations,
while singlet and triplet pairing correlations suppress, especially under
attractive interactions. In contrast, in the superhelical regime, a
perturbative Zeeman field enhances both spin singlet and spin triplet-x
pairings under repulsive interactions. We calculate both logarithmic and
residual corrections to charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and pairing
correlations, revealing short- and long-range behaviors. We further investigate
spin transport properties supplemented by a renormalization group analysis of
the temperature and frequency dependence of spin conductivity. We also analyze
the transport of momentum-spin-locked carriers in the presence of
Zeeman-induced and pairing-induced gaps, uncovering the effect of interactions
and the interplay between the two gaps in helical systems.

Motivation: The field of quantum many-body systems is complex, and computational accuracy is crucial for understanding strongly correlated systems. This paper introduces a method to address these challenges.

Method: The method involves the use of a cluster version of the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm within the framework of imaginary-time evolution for matrix product states. The wave-function ansatz is redefined to incorporate multiple physical degrees of freedom, enhancing entanglement representation. Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and optimized truncation schemes are employed to maintain computational efficiency while capturing more quantum correlations.

Result: Improved accuracy in physical quantities such as magnetization, ground-state energy, and entanglement entropy was demonstrated for three nontrivial cases: the gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the spin-1 anisotropic XXZD chain with a higher-order Gaussian-type phase transition, and a spin-1/2 twisted triangular prism hosting a magnetic plateau phase.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable framework for studying complex quantum systems with high precision, making it suitable for situations where increasing bond dimension alone is insufficient to achieve satisfactory results.

complexity while capturing more quantum correlations. We apply this approach to
three nontrivial cases: the gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the spin-1

a spin-1/2 twisted triangular prism hosting a magnetic plateau phase. Improved
accuracy in physical quantities, such as magnetization, ground-state energy,

Expands to account for commensurate and incommensurate magnetic satellites in antiferromagnets, reproducing additional diffraction peaks observed in materials like NiO, MnO, chromium, and cuprates. Diffraction serves as a tool to probe electronic topology and magneticordering equally, aiding structural characterization of correlated electron systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of electronic and magnetic properties in correlated electron systems using diffraction techniques. The ability to probe topology and magnetic ordering in antiferromagnetic materials opens new avenues for materials characterization and understanding of strongly correlated electron systems.

Method: Uses the SSH model as a simple starting point to introduce and justify the electronic structure factor. Extends to antiferromagnetic systems, accounting for additional magnetic satellite peaks. Employs mathematics and analogies to physics to justify the approach. Relies on known results about phase transitions and diffraction anomalies in antiferromagnetic materials to validate the generalization. Diffraction peaks are known experimental observation in oxides and cuprates, which serve as real-world test cases for the method.

Result: The electronic structure factor as a phase-sensitive diffraction parameter, particularly its connection to the Zak phase in the SSH model, successfully distinguishes topological and trivial phases. The inclusion of magnetic satellites explains additional diffraction peaks in antiferromagnetic compounds, aligning theoretical predictions with experiments in materials like NiO, MnO, chromium, and cuprates. The study establishes a framework for probing electronic topology and magnetic ordering simultaneously, providing a new tool for analyzing correlated electron systems.,

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel method using diffraction to study electronic topology and magnetic ordering in correlated electron systems. It successfully extends beyond the SSH model to account for magnetic satellite peaks in antiferromagnets. The method is validated by experimental data, demonstrating its applicability to real materials. This opens new possibilities for probing and characterizing strongly correlated electron systems through diffraction-based experiments.

Abstract: We introduce the electronic structure factor as a phase-sensitive
contribution to diffraction that directly encodes the properties of the
occupied-band wave functions. In the one-dimensional SSH model,
$F_{\mathrm{cond}}$ is governed by the relative sublattice phase, which
integrates to the Zak phase. This provides a clear diffraction-based criterion
to distinguish trivial and topological regimes in the absence of any structural
change. Beyond the SSH limit, the same Bloch-based construction naturally
accounts for commensurate and incommensurate magnetic satellites in
antiferromagnets, reproducing the additional peaks at $q=G\pm Q$ observed in
NiO, MnO, chromium, and cuprates. These results demonstrate that diffraction
can probe electronic topology and magnetic ordering on equal footing, opening a
route to phase-sensitive structural characterization of correlated electron
systems.

Abstract: The effects of strong electronic correlations and disorder are crucial for
emergent phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, metal-insulator
transitions, and quantum criticality. While both are omnipresent in real
materials, their individual impacts on charge transport remain elusive. To
disentangle their respective roles, we have independently varied the degree of
randomness and the strength of electronic correlations -- by chemical
substitution and physical pressure, respectively -- within the metallic phase
nearby a Mott-insulating state. We find a distinct correlation dependence of
the disorder-dependent residual resistivity $\rho_0$ in the Fermi-liquid regime
$\rho(T)=\rho_0 + A T^2$, where $A\propto (m^{\star}/m)^2$ quantifies the
electronic mass enhancement. Contrary to conventional expectations, we observe
that at fixed disorder level $\rho_0$ grows linearly with $A$. This scaling can
be understood in terms of chemical-potential fluctuations with variance
$\sigma_\mu^2$, yielding $\rho_0 \propto A\,\sigma_\mu^2$. By comparing our
findings to transport data on other organic Mott systems, oxides, heavy-fermion
compounds, and moir\'e materials, we demonstrate that this new relation between
residual resistivity and mass enhancement is a universal feature of correlated
metals.

Abstract: We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon
Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from
anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a
hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low temperature work, in the
absence of any interactions, is maximised in the pseudo fermionic limit, where
the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions
are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or
pseudo-fermionic extremes, but instead peaks at intermediate statistical
angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics
conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering
greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions,
in this regime. Furthermore, we also identify different modes of operation of
the HAO cycle, one of which emerges as a direct consequence of the finite anyon
energy at low temperature.

TL;DR: Exciton-polaritons can have exceptionally long lifetimes due to collective exciton-photon interactions, which create bound states that suppress radiation effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for long-lived polaritons to enhance nonlinear and quantum effects.

Method: Theoretical framework beyond the coupled oscillator model considering collective and coherent exciton-photon interactions.

Result: Strong suppression of polariton radiation leads to bound states with infinite lifetimes.

Conclusion: New design principles for engineered polaritons with tailored properties open new applications in nonlinear, topological, and quantum systems.

Abstract: Understanding the radiative decay of exciton-polaritons is essential for
achieving long-lived polaritons - a key prerequisite for enhancing nonlinear
and quantum polaritonic effects. However, conventional wisdom - the coupled
oscillator model - often oversimplifies polariton radiation as independent
emissions from uncoupled excitonic and photonic resonances, overlooking the
role of strong exciton-photon coupling in reshaping their radiative behavior.
In this work, we present a theoretical framework that goes beyond the
conventional coupled oscillator model by fully accounting for the collective
and coherent nature of exciton-photon interactions. We demonstrate that these
interactions can strongly suppress polariton radiation via destructive
interference - both within the excitonic ensemble and between excitonic and
photonic radiation channels - giving rise to polaritonic bound states in the
continuum with infinitely long radiative lifetimes. Our approach offers a
unified description of polariton radiative decay and establishes new design
principles for engineering long-lived exciton-polaritons with tailored
radiation properties, opening new avenues for nonlinear, topological, and
quantum polaritonic applications.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the first experimental realization of switchable skyrmions between electric and magnetic modes in toroidal light pulses using a nonlinear metasurface platform, enabling robust and versatile information carrier switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to develop robust information carriers capable of switching between different topological modes of skyrmions, which are exotic light-based structures with unique topological properties.

Method: The researchers used a nonlinear metasurface platform and vectorial terahertz pulses to generate and observe the switchable skyrmions.

Result: The experiment successfully demonstrated the switchable skyrmions between electric and magnetic modes with clear spatial and temporal evolutions, confirming the feasibility of manipulating topologically structured light.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for designing integrated devices for topological light manipulation and switches, with potential applications in ultra-stable and robust information transfer systems.

Abstract: Recent advances reveal that light propagation in free space supports many
exotic topological textures, such as skyrmions. Their unique space-time
topologies make them promising candidates as next-generation robust information
carriers. Hence, the ability of switching different texture modes is highly
demanded to serve as a manner of data transfer. However, previous studies focus
on generation of one specific mode, lacking integrated devices with externally
variable and stable mode generation capability. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate the first realization of switchable skyrmions between electric and
magnetic modes in toroidal light pulses using a nonlinear metasurface platform
in terms of broadband terahertz generation driven by vectorial pulse. The
spatial and temporal evolutions of them are also clearly observed. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for manipulating and switching topologically
structured light.

Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are unique topological materials
supporting edge states with the dimensionality at least by two lower than the
dimensionality of the underlying structure. HOTIs were observed on lattices
with different symmetries, but only in geometries, where truncation of HOTI
produces a finite structure with the same order of discrete rotational symmetry
as that of the unit cell, thereby setting the geometry of insulator edge. Here
we experimentally demonstrate a new type of two-dimensional (2D) HOTI based on
the Kekule-patterned lattice, whose order of discrete rotational symmetry
differs from that of the unit cells of the constituent honeycomb lattice, with
hybrid boundaries that help to produce all three possible corners that support
effectively 0D corner states of topological origin, especially the one
associated with spectral charge 5/6. We also show that linear corner states
give rise to rich families of stable hybrid nonlinear corner states bifurcating
from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity of the material. Such new
types of nonlinear corner states are observed in hybrid HOTI inscribed in
transparent nonlinear dielectric using fs-laser writing technique. Our results
complete the class of HOTIs and open the way to observation of topological
states with new internal structure and symmetry.

Abstract: We report on the development of low-loss ion-beam-sputtered (IBS)
mid-infrared coatings for hybrid supermirrors. Two highly reflective designs
were realized: HR1, a 4-period a-Si/SiO$_2$ DBR with an Al$_2$O$_3$ bonding
layer, and HR2, a 6-period a-Si/Ta$_2$O$_5$ DBR with an a-Si terminating layer
for bonding. Combined with a GaAs/AlGaAs crystalline mirror, HR2-based hybrids
yielded a total loss of 9.3 ppm and excess loss of 6.8 ppm at 4.45 $\mu$m, with
cavity finesse up to 396000. For the first time, we used IBS-deposited a-Si
directly as a bonding layer, verified its sub-angstrom roughness, and
demonstrated excellent performance. This establishes a clear path toward
scalable coatings for longer mid-infrared wavelengths, building on prior
results in Nat. Commun. 14, 7846 (2023).

Abstract: Scalable, high-speed, small-footprint photonic switching platforms are
essential for advancing optical communication. An effective optical switch must
operate at high duty cycles with fast recovery times, while maintaining
substantial modulation depth and full reversibility. Colloidal nanocrystals,
such as indium tin oxide (ITO), offer a scalable platform to meet these
requirements. In this work, the transmission of ITO nanocrystals near their
epsilon-near-zero wavelength is modulated by two-cycle optical pulses at a
repetition rate of one megahertz. The modulator exhibits a broad bandwidth
spanning from 2 um to 2.5 um. Sensitive fieldoscopy measurements resolve the
transient electric-field response of the ITO for the first time, showing that
the modulation remains reversible for excitation fluences up to 1.2 mJ/cm2 with
a modulation depth of 10%, and becomes fully irreversible beyond 3.3 mJ/cm2,
while reaching modulation depth of up to 20%. Field sampling further indicates
that at higher excitation fluences, the relative contribution from the first
cycle of the optical pulses is reduced. These findings are crucial for the
development of all-optical switching, telecommunications, and sensing
technologies capable of operating at terahertz switching frequencies.

Abstract: Although current amorphous high-reflective mirror coatings have had
tremendous success in metrology applications, they are inherently limited by
thermal fluctuations in their coating structure. Alternatively, crystalline
coating technology has demonstrated superior thermal noise performance.
However, recent studies have revealed birefringent noise sources, raising
questions about the limits of frequency stability of high-finesse cryogenic
silicon cavities with crystalline mirror coatings. Here, we show the
applicability of cavity-mode dispersion spectroscopy to measure birefringent
cavity mode splitting. We measured birefringence induced cavity mode splitting
by probing the resonance frequencies of a high-finesse, ultra-low expansion
glass cavity with all-crystalline mirror coatings, reaching fractional
frequency sensitivity of \SI{5e-14}{} utilizing an optical frequency comb for
two orthogonal polarizations. Subsequently, we calculated the static
birefringent splitting of the refractive index for \SI{23.8}{\celsius} and
\SI{31.3}{\celsius} on the order of \SI{802 \pm 7}{ppm} and \SI{772 \pm 7}{ppm}
over \SI{30}{nm} respectively. Furthermore, we propose measurements of
dispersive birefringent noise based on optical frequency combs. Our results not
only extend the use of optical frequency combs to measure static birefringence,
but also implicate a possibility to further study spectrally dependent
frequency noise.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide exceptional light confinement
due to their inherent decoupling from radiative channels. Small symmetry
breaking transforms BIC into quasi-BIC (qBIC) that couples to free-space
radiation enabling ultra-high-quality-factor (Q-factor) resonances desirable
for refractive index (RI) sensing. In practical implementations, geometric
asymmetry is typically employed. However, since the radiative loss remains
fixed once fabricated, such metasurfaces exhibit only a horizontal translation
of the resonance spectrum in RI sensing, without modification of its overall
shape. Here, we demonstrate a permittivity-asymmetric qBIC ({\epsilon}-qBIC)
metasurface, which encodes environmental refractive index variations directly
into the asymmetry factor, resulting in indexes response involving both
resonance wavelength shift and modulation variation. In addition to exhibiting
a competitive transmittance sensitivity of ~5300%/RIU under single-wavelength
conditions, the {\epsilon}-qBIC design provides a substantially improved linear
response. Specifically, the linear window area of its sensing data
distribution, calculated as the integrated wavelength region where the
linearity parameter remains above the preset threshold, is 104 times larger
than that of the geometry-asymmetric qBIC (g-qBIC), enabling more robust and
reliable single-wavelength signal readout. Additionally, numerical results
reveal that environmental permittivity asymmetry can optically restore the
g-qBIC to a state with ultra-high-Q (over 10^7), approaching to BIC condition.
Unlike traditional BICs, which are typically inaccessible once perturbed, the
permittivity-restored BIC becomes accessible through environmental
perturbations. These findings suggest an alternative design strategy for
developing high-performance photonic devices for practical sensing
applications.

Abstract: The ability to control topological properties of laser emission represents a
fundamental advancement in photonic technology. Achieving topological laser in
a single compact photonic structure is crucial for device integration and
miniaturization but faces significant challenges for designing both the
high-quality (high-Q) mode and radiative topological configurations. Recently,
bound states in the continuum (BICs), as extraordinary states possessing both
ultrahigh Q factors and polarization topological charges, have been
demonstrated as a promising platform for compact topological lasers. However,
as the cornerstone of BIC lasing's non-trivial properties, topological charges
of BICs are protected by real-space structural symmetries, which simultaneously
impose fundamental limitations that hinder their designability of lasing
topological charges. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a compound
cavity design method based on the M\"{o}bius-like correspondence in quasi-BICs
(q-BICs), by which compact vectorial microlasers with designable topological
charges can be realized. We reveal the hidden connection between real-space
symmetry breaking and eigen-polarizations of q-BICs from the triangular
photonic crystal (PhC) slab, manifesting as a M\"{o}bius-like correspondence.
By splicing PhC slab sectors utilizing this M\"{o}bius-like correspondence, we
establish a one-to-one correspondence between compound cavities and their
lasing topological charges. Vectorial lasing with designable topological
charges from $-5$ to $+5$ were experimentally realized. Our work establishes a
novel BIC-based platform that enables designable topological lasing, providing
a promising route toward compact topological sources.

Abstract: Infrared imaging is indispensable for its ability to penetrate obscurants and
visualize thermal signatures, yet its practical use is hindered by the
intrinsic limitations of conventional detectors. Nonlinear upconversion, which
converts infrared light into the visible band, offers a promising pathway to
address these challenges. Here, we demonstrate high-efficiency infrared
upconversion imaging using nonlinear silicon metasurfaces. By strategically
breaking in-plane symmetry, the metasurface supports a high-$Q$ quasi-bound
states in the continuum resonance, leading to strongly enhanced third-harmonic
generation (THG) with a conversion efficiency of $3\times10^{-5}$ at a pump
intensity of 10 GW/cm$^{2}$. Through this THG process, the metasurface enables
high-fidelity upconversion of arbitrary infrared images into the visible range,
achieving a spatial resolution of $\sim 6$ $\upmu$m as verified using a
resolution target and various customized patterns. This work establishes a
robust platform for efficient nonlinear conversion and imaging, highlighting
the potential of CMOS-compatible silicon metasurfaces for high-performance
infrared sensing applications with reduced system complexity.

Abstract: We investigate the transport of path-entangled multi-photon NOON states in a
flat-band photonic rhombic lattice and observe intriguing
localization-delocalization features that depend on the phase as well as the
photon number of the NOON states. To experimentally emulate photon number
correlations, we develop an intensity correlation measurement protocol using
coherent laser light with tunable relative phases. We first apply this protocol
to show spatial bunching and anti-bunching of two-photon NOON states in a
one-dimensional lattice consisting of identical waveguides. In the case of the
rhombic lattice, we show that for an even (odd) photon number $N$, localization
occurs at $0 \, (\pi)$ phase of the NOON state with a probability of $2^{1-N}$.
Our results open an exciting route toward predicting quantum interference of
correlated photons in complex photonic networks.

Motivation: Improving image resolution for clearer microscopy analysis and surpassing diffraction limits.

Result: The method achieved a 2.68x resolution improvement and exceeded the diffraction limit by 1.79x.

Conclusion: ImPASS is effective for high-resolution microscopy despite widefield limitations.

Abstract: Image Phase Alignment Super-Sampling (ImPASS) is a computational imaging
algorithm for converting a sequence of displaced low-resolution images into a
single high-resolution image. The method consists of a unique combination of
Phase Correlation image registration and SeDDaRA blind deconvolution. The
method has previously been validated in simulations and applied successfully to
images captured in a laboratory setting. As discussed here, the performance of
ImPASS surpasses similar methods that provide quantitative results. ImPASS is
applied for the first time to images taken by a widefield microscope, requiring
no customization other than a translation stage, to determine if this approach
can subceed the diffraction limit for this application. The 80-frame image sets
had as targets a slide with a slice of Porcine Cornea, and a standard US Air
Force resolution chart, providing quantitative and quantitative assessments.
The sets were up-sampled by a factor of eight, aligned, combined, and
processed. The measurement revealed that image resolution improved by a factor
of 2.68 and subceeded the diffraction limit by a factor of 1.79.

Abstract: The basic physics of lasers is characterized by a second-order continuous
phase transition at the critical lasing threshold. Nevertheless, laser
bistability with abrupt transitions has been reported in some laser systems,
but its underlying mechanism has never been explored. Here we study
experimentally and theoretically a novel nonlinearly self-coupled laser system.
We show both experimentally and theoretically that this system experiences
spontaneous cascading that yields an abrupt mixed-order transition. At the
critical point, a long-lived cascading plateau is observed, characterized by a
critical branching factor equal to one. When deviating from criticality, the
branching factor departs monotonically from one. The critical scaling close to
and at the critical point resembles similar phenomena observed recently in
other interdependent systems, suggesting a common universal cascading origin
for abrupt transitions. Our results shed light on the cascading mechanism of
abrupt transitions in laser systems, which can be utilized for future research
and applications.

Abstract: Atom interferometry is a natural laboratory for precision tests of general
relativity, but there is no simple relationship between atom interferometer
phase and geometric properties of spacetime. Here we show that a different atom
interferometer observable, the phase shear, can be expressed directly as the
integrated sectional curvature over a spacetime surface enclosed by the
interferometer arms and final beamsplitter. This is a consequence of a
generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which also explicitly computes small
correction terms arising from gravitational redshift of atom optics pulses.
This synthesis of quantum mechanics, relativity, and differential geometry
affords a manifestly coordinate-free and representation-free means of measuring
spacetime properties. Additionally, it provides a convenient computational tool
for predicting atom interferometer properties in arbitrary background
spacetimes.
