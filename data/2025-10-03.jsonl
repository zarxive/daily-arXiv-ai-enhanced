We demonstrate that this holographic expectation is at odds with\nthe fact that, even at low temperatures, there exist saddles of the bulk path\nintegral with real part of on-shell action smaller than that of the thermal\nrotating gas. The usual Kerr-AdS black holes but with complex parameters are\nexamples of such saddles.

In this paper, we extend the analysis to\nthe general case of dispersive refractive media in motion and study its\ninfluence on light deflection. We consider an axially symmetric stationary\nspacetime filled with a moving medium, motivated by the interplay between\nrotational effects originating from the spacetime and those induced by the\nmedium's motion. We begin by analyzing light deflection in the equatorial plane\nof a rotating object in the presence of a radially moving and rotating medium.\nAssuming a specific form of the refractive index enables a fully analytic\ntreatment. In the particular cases of either pure radial or pure rotational\nmotion, we obtain explicit expressions for the deflection angle. Next, we\nanalyze the case of a slowly moving medium and identify two particularly\ninteresting results.

The method involves solving Maxwell's equations\nfor a large number of coupled electromagnetic plane-waves inside the dielectric\nslab, then matching the boundary conditions at the interface between the\nincidence medium and the slab, as well as those at the interface between the\nslab and the transmittance medium. In this way, one obtains the E-field and\nH-field amplitudes for all the reflected and transmitted plane-waves (i.e.,\ndiffraction orders as well as evanescent waves) that emerge within the\nincidence and transmittance media. If the refractive index (or dielectric\ntensor) of the holographic slab happens to vary in the thickness direction, one\ntreats the slab as a number of thin layers stacked upon each other, then\ncomputes and combines the scattering matrices of these layers to arrive at the\ncomplete solution for the entire stack.

These\nobservations can be intuitively rationalized by noting that the amine head\ngroup have two hydrogen atoms when the hydroxyl group have only one, but they\noppose the following two facts: i) computer simulations show\nmicro-heterogeneity for both systems; ii) amines mix with water better than\nalcohols, both over larger concentrations and alkyl tails lengths.\n  The study of the atom-atom pair correlation functions and related structure\nfactors allows to understand the microscopic molecular details. The most\ninteresting observation is that the amine head groups accumulate preferentially\nat the surface of the water domains, and increasingly better with longer alkyl\ntail, thus allowing to stabilize both the water and alkylamine domains, hence\navoiding macroscopic demixing, except at high water concentrations when amines\nare scarce to achieve efficient surface saturation. The amine domains appear as\ndisordered bilayers.

In a two-dimensional electronic\nsystem, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons\ncondense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This\nordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic\nscale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and\nmoire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be\nformed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying\nvoltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole\ndensity by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For\ndensities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes\nindividual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By\nincreasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi\nliquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which\nindicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be\nformed within a narrow effective density range.

With increasing interaction\nstrength, anisotropy-induced partial-wave mixing generates distinct polaron and\nmolaron resonances, allowing for radially and angularly excited bound states to\nbecome accessible. This approach captures the anisotropy and non-additivity\ncharacteristic of a Rydberg impurity immersed in a quantum bath, and provides\nbroad applicability to a host of quantum impurity problems beyond the\nFr\\\"ohlich paradigm."}

Using quasiadiabatic evolution, we establish a\ncorrespondence between adiabatic cycles and invertible defects generated by\nspatially truncated Thouless pump operators. Employing the classification of\ngapped phases by module categories, we show that the Thouless pumps are\nclassified by the group of autoequivalences of the module category. We then\nexplicitly construct Thouless pump operators for minimal lattice models with\n$\\text{Vec}_G$, Rep($G$), and Rep($H$) symmetries, and show how the Thouless\npump operators have the group structure of autoequivalences. The Thouless pump\noperators, together with Hamiltonians with gapped ground states, are then used\nto construct Floquet drives. An analytic solution for the Floquet phase diagram\ncharacterized by winding numbers is constructed when the Floquet drives obey an\nOnsager algebra. Our approach points the way to a general connection between\ndistinct Thouless pumps and distinct families of Floquet phases."}

In a two-dimensional electronic\nsystem, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons\ncondense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This\nordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic\nscale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and\nmoire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be\nformed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying\nvoltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole\ndensity by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For\ndensities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes\nindividual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By\nincreasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi\nliquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which\nindicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be\nformed within a narrow effective density range. Our results provide a new\nplatform for further exploration of the microscopic feature of strong\ncorrelated physics and open an avenue to exploit the application of Wigner\nmolecules for quantum information in a very promising spin qubit platform."}

Colloidal lead halide perovskite\nquantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can\nproduce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate.\nHere, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity\nwith a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating\nPurcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up\nto 18.1 $\\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By\nin-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD\nto different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the\ngenerated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity.
