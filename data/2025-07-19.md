### [1] [Phase noise measurement of semiconductor optical amplifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13128)
*Damien Teyssieux,Martin Callejo,Jacques Millo,Enrico Rubiola,Rodolphe Boudot*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于测量光放大器相位噪声的新方法，类似于H-MZ干涉仪，但基于不同原理，测量了1.55μm光纤放大器的相位噪声，结果显示相位噪声随激光功率的减少呈倒数关系下降，达到较低水平，具有应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相位噪声在光放大器中是关键指标，优化放大器性能需要精确测量其相位噪声。

Method: 实验方法包括使用对称的MZ干涉仪，一个光致偏振器（AOM）在另一臂，测量射出MZ输出的RF beat的相位噪声。

Result: 测量结果表明，相位噪声随激光输入功率降低，达到-125 dBrad²/Hz，而 flicker noise 无法测量，但给出了上限噪声-32 dBrad²/Hz。

Conclusion: 该方法精度高，适合用于光放大器等应用领域，尤其是频率稳定方面。

Abstract: We introduce a novel measurement method for the phase noise measurement of
optical amplifiers, topologically similar to the Heterodyne Mach-Zehnder
Interferometer but governed by different principles, and we report on the
measurement of a fibered amplifier at 1.55 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength. The
amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the
RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the
amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the
amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$
$\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower
than the background of the setup. This sets an upper bound of the amplifier
noise at $-32$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=1$ $\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds
to a frequency stability of $5.2{\times}10^{-17}/\tau$ (Allan deviation), where
$\tau$ is the integration time. Such noise level is lower than that of most
Fabry-Perot cavity-stabilized lasers. These results are of interest in a wide
range of applications including metrology, instrumentation, optical
communications, or fiber links.

### [2] [Plasmonic Color Filters Enable Label-Free Plasmon-Enhanced Array Tomography with sub-diffraction limited resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12786)
*Kristian Caracciolo,Eugeniu Balaur,Erinna F. Lee,W. Douglas Fairlie,Julian Ratcliffe,Eric Hanssen,David Hoxley,Jacqueline Orian,Chad Johnson,Lu Yu,Kang Han,Wei Xiang,Brian Abbey*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using plasmonic metamaterials to visualize the refractive index of cells with 3D, sub-microscopic resolution, enabling label-free histological imaging that surpasses current techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved microscopy methods, especially in histology, given limitations of traditional staining techniques and the potential of biophysical markers like intracellular refractive index (RI).

Method: They used plasmonic metamaterials designed as microscope slides to create a system that translates RI changes into colors. They employed PE array tomography and electron tomography to image whole cells at super-resolved 3D in sub-microscopic scales.

Result: They achieved axially super-resolved imaging of cells in the 30-200 nm range and demonstrated the potential for 3D, colorimetric histology at sub-organelle levels.

Conclusion: This method offers label-free imaging with higher resolution than traditional histology, with applications in multimodal 3D biophysical imaging.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the subcellular organisation and morphology
of cells and tissues is essential for understanding biological function.
Although staining is the most widely used approach for visualising biological
samples under a microscope, the intracellular refractive index (RI) has been
proposed as a potential biophysical marker that could supplement or even
surpass the sensitivity of current histological methods. Hence, the development
of new, highly sensitive, label-free techniques that can detect changes in the
intracellular RI is extremely desirable for biomedical imaging. The recent
development of plasmonic metamaterials, designed to mimic a traditional
microscope slide, have made it possible to translate subtle changes in
refractive index directly into color. This approach enables label-free
visualization of tissue microstructure using standard histological slide
preparation methods. Here we demonstrate ultramicrotome-assisted optical
plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography and correlate this with electron array
tomography of the same sample embedded in resin. The approach enables axially
super-resolved label-free imaging of whole cells in the range of 30-200 nm and
shows great potential for multimodal three-dimensional colorimetric histology
at the (sub-) organelle level.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 研究者首次在GaAs纳米约束器件中实现了双极性SR光电响应，通过控制光照强度和散射机制，实现了电流极性的反转，展示了通过几何调控和可逆的电子-空穴不对称性实现先进光电子器件的新途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光电子器件中光电响应的极性 toggle 是许多现代光电子应用的基础，如光逻辑、神经计算和成像。然而，传统系统中的电子和空穴双向运输会抑制极性变化。因此，研究者试图通过新的机制实现双极性极性反转。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了通过材料和结构调控实现双极性SR响应的可能性，为光电子学的应用打开了新的方向。这也为开发高对比度的光探测器和其他需要极性反转的光电子器件提供了基础。

Abstract: Bipolar photoresponse - where photocurrent polarity reverses with excitation
wavelength, gate voltage, or other conditions - is essential for optical logic,
neuromorphic computing, and imaging. Unlike unipolar responses, bipolar
behavior enables direct binary encoding and enhanced photodetection contrast.
However, in conventional photoconductive or photovoltaic systems, the
simultaneous and opposite-directional transport of electrons and holes often
suppresses polarity switching. Recent self-powered Shockley-Ramo (SR)
photoresponse in gapless materials also show only unipolar signals due to
strong, irreversible electron-hole asymmetry. Here, we demonstrate for the
first-time bipolar SR photoresponse in GaAs nanoconstriction devices by
exploiting reversible electron-hole asymmetry. The longer carrier lifetimes in
GaAs enable sub-diffusion-length control of carrier dynamics through geometry.
By tuning photocarrier dynamics near the nanoconstriction for both majority
electrons and minority holes, we modulate the SR response to exhibit dual
polarities. At low excitation, photoelectrons dominate; as excitation
increases, intervalley scattering populates higher-energy L-valleys, reducing
electron contribution and leading to polarity reversal driven by the growing
dominance of photoexcited holes. These results, supported by SR theory, show
that nanoscale geometric engineering, together with the reversible
electron-hole asymmetry, enables self-powered bipolar photocurrent responses,
offering new routes toward advanced optoelectronic devices.

### [4] [Trapping absorbing and non-absorbing aqueous particle using a universal 4-arm Laguerre-Gaussian mode light trap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12994)
*Krispin M. Dettlaff,James Wenger,Grégory David,Ruth Signorell*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Paper introduces a new method for trapping and analyzing absorbing and non-absorbing particles, which is crucial for understanding atmospheric processes. The trap uses optical beams and doesn't require mechanical realignment, which is a significant improvement. The trap was effective at trapping various particles, and it allowed spectroscopic measurements, which are essential for studying photochemical reactions. However, more testing and characterization are needed before it can be widely used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the aging processes of absorbing aerosols in the atmosphere and their impact on climate and human health, new tools are needed to continuously monitor these particles without disrupting their state. This paper presents an optical trap solution that addresses the limitations of previous methods, potentially advancing atmospheric science research.

Method: The researchers used four trapping beams including both Laguerre-Gaussian and fundamental Gaussian beams, modulated with a spatial light modulator, to create a flexible optical trap. They demonstrated the trap's performance with various particles, including aqueous droplets with fulvic acid, and utilized techniques like digital holography and spectroscopy.

Result: The trap allows for continuous trapping without the need for mechanical adjustment, enabling the observation of photochemical reactions and the acquisition of spectroscopic data. This development is a step toward better modeling of absorbing particles' aging processes.

Conclusion: This trap innovation is a promising tool for atmospheric studies, overcoming previous limitations and facilitating the analysis of absorbing particles. Future applications could enhance our understanding of atmospheric aerosol dynamics and their environmental effects.

Abstract: Absorbing aerosols, such as brown carbon (BrC) and absorbing secondary
organic aerosols (SOA), has attracted broad interest due to their importance
for climate and human health. The pronounced time-dependence of light
absorption during aging renders the precise estimation of their impact on
global warming difficult. Single particle studies of such aerosols would be
very useful to better understand their aging in the atmosphere through
processes such as photochemistry. However previously proposed optical traps
cannot continuously trap particles whose absorption state changes from strongly
absorbing to non-absorbing or vice versa. Some of the traps presented can
isolate absorbing and non-absorbing particles, but require mechanical alignment
of the trap depending on the strength of particle absorption. However,
mechanical realignment is not compatible with continuous trapping and
observation. Here, we introduce a flexible optical universal trap which does
not require mechanical realignment. The versatility of the trap relies on four
trapping beams - either vortex Laguerre- Gaussian (LG) or fundamental Gaussian
beams - which are modulated with a spatial light modulator (SLM), The
performance of the trap is demonstrated by trapping different types of
absorbing and non-absorbing particles. We also show that the trap can be used
to observe the photochemical reaction of aqueous droplets containing fulvic
acid, a common component of BrC. Digital holography measurements demonstrate
that the confinement of the particles in the trap can be controlled by changing
the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG beams. The study also shows that
spectroscopy measurements, such as fluorescence and Raman scattering, are
possible in all configurations of the proposed trap.

### [5] [Nanodomain poling unlocking backward nonlinear light generation in thin film lithium niobate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13004)
*Alessandra Sabatti,Jost Kellner,Robert J. Chapman,Rachel Grange*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents scalable periodic poling in x-cut TFLN with sub-micron periods, enabling efficient nonlinear frequency conversion. They achieve high conversion efficiencies and demonstrate devices for both counter- and backward-propagating phase matching. Their work on sum frequency generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion in these devices is also notable. This allows for precise control in applications like quantum computing and metrology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lithium niobate is a key material in nonlinear optics, and this paper addresses a significant limitation in its application through periodic poling. The ability to scale down the poling period opens up new possibilities for efficient nonlinear devices, which are essential for advanced technologies like quantum computing and metrology.

Method: The authors developed scalable periodic poling techniques for x-cut TFLN, achieving very short periods of 215 nm. They used these poled crystals to create devices for both counter-propagating and backward propagating interactions, measuring conversion efficiencies and confirming sum frequency generation and parametric down-conversion processes.

Result: Experiments show conversion efficiencies of 1474 %/W/cm² and 45 %/W/cm², and successful spontaneous parametric down-conversion in backward propagating devices. These results suggest significant potential for applications in quantum optics and beyond.

Conclusion: The scalable periodic poling in TFLN provides precise control over nonlinear processes, enabling highly efficient photon pair generation with tailored spatial and spectral properties, which is a major step forward for quantum signal processing, quantum computing, and precision metrology.

Abstract: Nonlinear frequency conversion offers powerful capabilities for applications
in telecommunications, signal processing, and computing. Thin-film lithium
niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising integrated photonics platform due to
its strong electro-optic effect and second-order nonlinearity, which can be
exploited through periodic poling. However, conventional poling techniques in
x-cut TFLN are limited to minimum period sizes on the order of microns,
preventing the efficient generation of interactions involving
counter-propagating waves. Here we report scalable periodic poling of x-cut
TFLN with periods down to 215 nm and realize devices for counter- and
back-propagating phase matching. We estimate conversion efficiencies of 1474
$\%$/W/cm$^2$ and 45 $\%$/W/cm$^2$ respectively, and measuring sum frequency
generation we confirm that the nonlinear generation takes place in the desired
direction. We report spontaneous parametric down conversion for the
counter-propagating and, for the first time, for a backward propagating device.
This technological advance provides the control of domain geometry in TFLN with
an unprecedented precision and leads into the generation of photon pairs with
spatial and spectral properties tailored for quantum signal processing, quantum
computing and metrology.

Abstract: One-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) are widely used platforms for
guiding, filtering, and enhancing light at the nanoscale. Traditionally,
designs have favored high refractive index contrast to maximize the photonic
band gap (PBG) size. Here, we demonstrate that low-index contrast systems offer
a powerful and underexplored route to achieving improved optical
functionalities. In particular, we show that low index contrast enables more
closely aligned PBGs for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM)
polarizations, allowing for broadband superposition of TE and TM Bloch Surface
Waves (BSWs). As a demonstration of this functionality, we use this approach to
design 1DPCs capable of generating planar superchiral fields for enhanced
circular dichroism spectroscopy. To realize such structures, we use an
automated design framework based on multi-objective genetic optimization. By
comparing optimized designs in both high and low index contrast regimes, we
find that low index contrast systems yield significantly greater overlap
between the TE and TM BSW dispersion relations and exhibit a pronounced
reduction in optical anisotropy - both of which contribute to enhanced optical
chirality across the operational bandwidth. Furthermore, simulations reveal
that these low index contrast structures offer improved robustness to
fabrication tolerances and support a wider dynamic range of chiral analyte
concentrations. In addition to their optical performance advantages, low-index
contrast systems are naturally compatible with polymeric materials, which offer
benefits such as low cost, sustainability, and mechanical flexibility. While
this work focuses on mode alignment and its consequences for surface wave
behavior, the underlying principles have broader implications for
polarization-independent photonic technologies, including optical sensing,
computing, and spectral filtering.

Abstract: We study the evolution of the kinetic energy (or gradient norm) of an
incident linearly polarised monochromatic wave propagating in correlated random
media. We explore the optical flux transverse to the mean Poynting flux at the
paraxial-nonparaxial (vectorial) transition along with vortex counting and
identify universal features in the dynamics. The vortex number appears to
increase with a cubic root for sufficiently small correlation length.
Furthermore, a kink appears in nucleation rate at the position of maximum
scintillation upon increasing correlation length. A driven steady state is
reached due to the filtering of evanescent waves upon propagation. Finally, we
present the spectrum of the incompressible kinetic energy and how it evolves
from the paraxial case to that of a random field.

Abstract: Ultra-rapid, high-precision distance metrology is critical for both advanced
scientific research and practical applications. However, current light
detection and ranging technologies struggle to simultaneously achieve high
measurement speed, accuracy, and a large non-ambiguity range. Here, we present
a time-of-flight optical ranging technique based on a
repetition-frequency-modulated femtosecond electro-optic comb and balanced
nonlinear cross-correlation detection. In this approach, a target distance is
determined as an integer multiple of the comb repetition period. By rapidly
sweeping the comb repetition frequency, we achieve absolute distance
measurements within 500 ns and real-time displacement tracking at single-pulse
resolution (corresponding to a refresh rate of 172 MHz). Furthermore, our
system attains an ultimate ranging precision of 5 nm (with 0.3 s integration
time). Our method uniquely integrates nanometer-scale precision,
megahertz-level refresh rates, and a theoretically unlimited ambiguity range
within a single platform, while also supporting multi-target detection. These
advances pave the way for high-speed, high-precision ranging systems in
emerging applications such as structural health monitoring, industrial
manufacturing, and satellite formation flying.

Abstract: Hyperbolic media enable unique optical phenomena including hyperlensing,
negative refraction, enhanced photonic density of states (PDOS), and highly
confined polaritons. While most hyperbolic media are artificially engineered
metamaterials, certain natural materials with extreme anisotropy can exhibit
hyperbolic dispersion. Here, we report the first observation of natural
hyperbolic dispersion in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in the deep-ultraviolet
(DUV) regime, induced by strong, anisotropic exciton resonances. Using imaging
spectroscopic ellipsometry (ISE), we characterize the complex dielectric
function along in-plane and out-of-plane directions down to 190 nm (6.53 eV),
revealing a type-II hyperbolic window in the DUV regime. This hyperbolicity
supports hyperbolic exciton polaritons (HEP) with high directionality and slow
group velocity. Our findings establish hBN as a promising platform for
nanophotonic applications in the technologically significant DUV spectral
range.

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于开发利用小型弹性梁多模态振动的微纳技术，但未来仍需深入研究不同条件下模型的有效范围。

Abstract: A theoretical description of the weakly nonlinear and mode-dependent dynamics
of a nanoscale beam that is under intrinsic tension is developed. A full
analysis of the dynamic range of the beam over a wide range of conditions is
presented. The dynamic range is bounded from below by the amplitude of
vibration due to thermal motion and it is bounded from above by large amplitude
oscillations where the geometric nonlinearity plays a significant role due to
stretching induced tension. The dynamics are analyzed using a beam with clamped
boundaries, a string model, and a beam with hinged boundaries. The range of
validity for the different models is quantified in detail. A hinged beam model
is found to provide an accurate description, with insightful closed-form
analytical expressions, over a wide range of conditions. The relative
importance of bending and tension in the mode-dependent dynamics of the beam is
determined. Bending is shown to be important for the higher modes of
oscillation with the onset of its importance dependent upon the amount of
intrinsic tension that is present. The theoretical predictions are directly
compared with experimental measurements for the first ten modes of two
nanoscale beams. We discuss the accuracy of these approaches and their use for
the development of emerging micro and nanoscale technologies that exploit the
multimodal dynamics of small elastic beams operating in the linear regime.

Motivation: 核反应数据准确性对核能应用至关重要，解决实验不一致问题有助于提高数据可靠性。

Method: 通过调整Be的(n,n)和(n,2n)反应的二次角分布，结合实验数据进行计算。

Result: 调整后，HMF-058和HMF-066的累积卡方值从7.58降至4.52，进一步验证了实验数据的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实验间存在系统性差异，但改进后的数据分析支持HMF-058比HMF-066更可靠。

Abstract: Neutron-induced nuclear reaction data on beryllium playing a crucial role in
nuclear application. However, discrepancies have been observed in two closely
related series of beryllium-reflector fast-spectrum critical benchmark
experiments, HMF-058 and HMF-066, which are widely used in current nuclear data
validation. In this work, we address these inconsistencies by improving the
secondary angular distributions of the (n,n) and (n,2n) reactions of beryllium,
thereby making the theoretical calculations (C) and experimental results (E) of
these two series more consistent, and reducing the cumulative ${\chi^2}$ value
from 7.58 using the ENDF/B-VII.1 to 4.52. All calculations based on the
improved nuclear data agree with the experimental measurements within
1${\sigma}$ experimental uncertainty. Based on the latest comprehensive
evaluation of uranium nuclear data, this consistency is slightly improved, and
the cumulative ${\chi^2}$ value decreases to 4.36 once again. Despite these
advances, systematic differences in the expected values of C/E between the two
series still exist. The C/E values of the HMF-066 series are generally 230-330
pcm lower than those of the HMF-058 series, comparable to their experimental
uncertainties of 200-400 pcm. Therefore, drawing a definitive conclusion about
this systematic difference remains challenging. If the current improvement of
differential nuclear data based on experimental data of ${^9}$Be is accurate,
then the HMF-058 series experiments seem to be more reliable than the HMF-066
series.

Abstract: We develop a multi-port-backscatter-modulation technique to determine, over
the air (OTA), the scattering parameters of a linear, passive, time-invariant
multi-port device under test (DUT). A set of "not-directly-accessible" (NDA)
antennas can be switched between being terminated by the DUT or by a specific,
known, tunable load network. Waves can be radiated and captured via a distinct
set of "accessible" antennas that couple OTA to the NDA antennas. First, we
characterize the OTA fixture between the accessible antennas' ports and the
DUT's ports. We achieve this based on our recently introduced "Virtual VNA"
technique; specifically, we connect the NDA antennas to the tunable load
network and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas' ports for
various configurations of the tunable load network. Second, we connect the NDA
antennas to the DUT and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas'
ports. Third, we de-embed the OTA fixture to retrieve the DUT's scattering
parameters. We experimentally validate our technique at 2.45 GHz for 1-port
DUTs and 5-port DUTs, considering a rich-scattering OTA fixture inside a
reverberation chamber. We systematically study the influence of the number of
accessible antennas and various conceivable simplifications in terms of the
system model as well as the properties of the tunable load network. Our
wireless multi-port sensing technique can find applications in areas like RFID
and wireless bioelectronics.

### [13] [Crystal Collimation Cleaning Measurements with 6.5 TeV protons in the LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13315)
*Roberto Rossi,Gianluca Cavoto,Daniele Mirarchi,Stefano Redaelli,Walter Scandale*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the implementation and testing of a novel method for beam halo removal using short bent crystals in the CERN LHC. The crystals were situated on beam lines with high-accuracy actuators and tested in both baseline and new collimation setups. The results validated their efficiency, showing improved halo suppression compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern colliders face challenges in reducing thermal loads, and beam halo removal is crucial. The LHC's upgrade aimed to address these issues with innovative solutions, this paper presents such a solution with experimental validation.

Method: The study involved installing two short bent crystals on beam lines at precise angles and measuring their impact on beam halo. The crystals were tested in both standard and upgraded collimation systems to assess their cleaning efficiency using angular actuators for fine adjustments.

Result: Experiments showed efficient halo suppression with the crystals, aligning with theoretical predictions. The new collimation method outperformed traditional setups when tested in simulations and actual operation.

Conclusion: The upgraded collimation system with the added crystals proved effective in reducing beam halo, validating the method for futureollider applications. This represents progress in addressing thermal challenges, offering a practical solution for beam halo mitigation.

Abstract: Safe disposal of beam halo is a fundamental requirement of modern
superconductive hadron colliders to reduce thermal load on magnets and
background to experimental detectors. In the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) a
multistage system fully compliant with the needs of the baseline operation was
build. At a later stage, two short bent crystals were interleaved to the
devices for betatron collimation to investigate efficiency enhancement of the
halo disposal when inserting them as primary stages of the collimation
hierarchy. Each crystal was mounted on a high--accuracy angular actuator,
called goniometer, and installed in the clockwise Beam 1, one for the
horizontal and one for the vertical plane. In this paper, measurements of the
cleaning performance at collision energy with and without inserting crystals in
the standard collimation schemes are discussed; the results are compared to
theoretical expectations.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper investigates energy dynamics in a unitary Fermi gas, using periodic trap modulation to excite a breathing mode without dissipation, measuring energy evolution and finding results consistent with the dynamic virial theorem but differing from equilibrium expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study focuses on energy dynamics in non-equilibrium systems, which is crucial for understanding non-equilibrium thermodynamics and potential applications in various physical systems.

Method: The researchers modulated the trapping potential periodically, excited a breathing mode in the spherical unitary Fermi gas exploiting SO(2,1) symmetry, measured energy evolution, and validated against the dynamic virial theorem.

Result: Energy and trapping potential modulate with time, oscillating nearly 180 degrees out of phase, with decreased efficiency at higher modulation amplitudes, aligning with dynamic virial theorem predictions.

Conclusion: This research provides key insights into energy injection and redistribution in non-equilibrium systems, especially relevant for future thermodynamic investigations of such quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate the energy dynamics of a unitary Fermi gas driven away from
equilibrium. The energy is injected into the system by periodically modulating
the trapping potential of a spherical unitary Fermi gas, and due to the
existence of SO(2,1) symmetry, the breathing mode is excited without
dissipation. Through the long-lived breathing oscillation, we precisely measure
the energy evolution of the nonequilibrium system during the trap modulation.
We find the trapping potential and internal energies increase with modulation
time and simultaneously oscillate nearly $\textrm{180}^{\textrm{o}}$ out of
phase. At large modulation amplitudes, the energy-injection efficiency is
strongly reduced due to the trap anharmonicity. Unlike the equilibrium system,
the measured energy evolution agrees well with predictions of the dynamic
virial theorem. Our work provides valuable insights into the energy injection
and redistribution in a non-equilibrium system, paving a way for future
investigations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that
captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals
observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential.
By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its
isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped
condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained
description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium
configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply
the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the
effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs
constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction
and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the
effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko
mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order
actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了有效减少 Rydberg 原子去相干的创新方法，推动了量子计算和网络的发展。

Abstract: Cold Rydberg atoms, known for their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole
interactions that lead to the Rydberg blockade phenomenon, are among the most
promising platforms for quantum simulations, quantum computation and quantum
networks. However, a major limitation to the performance of Rydberg atom-based
platforms is dephasing, which can be caused by atomic motion within the trap.
Here, we propose a trap for $^{87}$Rb cold atoms that confines both the
electronic ground state and a Rydberg state, engineered to minimize the
differential light shifts between the two states. This is achieved by combining
a fictitious magnetic field induced by optical nanofibre guided light and an
external bias magnetic field. We calculate trap potentials for the cases of
one- and two-guided modes with quasi-linear and quasi-circular polarisations,
and calculate trap depths and trap frequencies for different values of laser
power and bias fields. Moreover, we discuss the impact of the quadrupole
polarisability of the Rydberg atoms on the trap potential and demonstrate how
the size of a Rydberg atom influences the ponderomotive potential generated by
the nanofibre-guided light field. This work expands on the idea of
light-induced fictitious magnetic field traps and presents a practical approach
for creating quantum networks using Rydberg atoms integrated with optical
nanofibres to generate 1D atom arrays.

Method: 本研究使用了离子碰撞的态密度模型，结合精确的电子运动轨道理论，分析电子自旋和轨道动量在碰撞中的相互作用。

Result: 不同初始Li状态显示出不同的共振数量和分布，实验数据特别是最低级Li状态的分布与模型一致，但第二低级状态与实验不一致。

Conclusion: 强自旋轨道偶联是引起不同初始Li状态出现不同数目的共振的主要原因，这也解释了为什么实验结果与模型预测存在部分差异。

Abstract: We report a pronounced dependence of magnetic Feshbach resonance spectra on
the initial hyperfine-Zeeman state of Li in ultracold $^{138}$Ba$^+$+$^6$Li
collisions. The measured number and distribution of resonances differ
significantly between the two lowest states despite their similar electron spin
character. We address this puzzle by developing a comprehensive yet generic
computational model calibrated against key statistical features in the
experimental spectrum. We confirm that strong spin-orbit coupling induces
essential changes in the distribution of resonances, leading to an increase in
the number of resolvable resonances. Our model reproduces the statistics of the
spectrum with the lowest Li state but struggles with the second-lowest state,
where a significantly smaller number of resonances is experimentally observed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are interested in understanding quantum systems at the nanoscale, which requires controlled rotational excitation of molecules. Optical centrifuges provide this by enabling controlled rotational frequencies, making them ideal for such studies.

Method: The method involves using a technique called spectral focusing to design an optical centrifuge that allows for very low rotational accelerations, down to zero, which is a significant improvement over conventional centrifuges.

Result: The authors successfully demonstrate their design using this new centrifuge method, which shows promising potential for investigating molecular rotation within helium nanodroplets.

Conclusion: This advancement in the design of optical centrifuges provides a powerful new tool for probing many-body quantum systems at the nanoscale, offering exciting possibilities for future studies in quantum mechanics and molecular physics.

Abstract: An optical centrifuge is a laser pulse which enables controlled rotational
excitation of molecules. Centrifuged molecules rotating with well-defined
angular frequencies are ideal candidates to probe many-body quantum systems at
the nanoscale. Because the interaction with the quantum environment increases
the effective moment of inertia of the embedded molecular probes, the required
rotational acceleration of the optical centrifuge must be lowered to
accommodate adiabatic spinning. We demonstrate a new design of an optical
centrifuge, based on the method of spectral focusing, which enables extremely
low, down to zero, rotational accelerations. We discuss the potential of using
such constant frequency centrifuge to investigate molecular rotation inside
helium nanodroplets.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently estimating free energy for complex electron systems, which is crucial for understanding quantum phenomena in fusion energy research.

Method: The authors propose using an intermediate reference system based on spherically averaged Ewald interactions and a ξ-extrapolation technique to mitigate computational bottlenecks and the fermion sign problem.

Result: They achieve a 18x speed-up in evaluating the free energy for a uniform electron gas and successfully compute accurate results for 1000 electrons, demonstrating the method's applicability in fusion modeling with moderate quantum degeneracy.

Conclusion: The combined use of artificial reference methods and ξ-extrapolation offers a promising advancement in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for planetary and inertial confinement fusion applications.

Abstract: We present a methodology for accelerating the estimation of the free energy
from path integral Monte Carlo simulations by considering an intermediate
artificial reference system where interactions are inexpensive to evaluate
numerically. Using the spherically averaged Ewald interaction as this
intermediate reference system for the uniform electron gas, the interaction
contribution for the free energy was evaluated up to 18 times faster than the
Ewald-only method. Furthermore, a $\xi$-extrapolation technique was tested and
applied to alleviate the fermion sign problem and to resolve the sign for large
particle numbers. Combining these two techniques enabled the evaluation of the
free energy for a system of 1000 electrons, where both finite-size and
statistical errors are below chemical accuracy. The general procedure can be
applied to systems relevant for planetary and inertial confinement fusion
modeling with low to moderate levels of quantum degeneracy.

Abstract: The formulation of vertex corrections beyond the $GW$ approximation within
the framework of perturbation theory is a subtle and challenging task, which
accounts for the wide variety of schemes proposed over the years. Exact
self-energies are required to satisfy the mathematical condition of positive
semi-definiteness. The $GW$ self-energy fulfills this property, but the vast
majority of the vertex-corrected self-energy approximations do not. In this
study, we devise a positive semi-definite extension to the $GW$+2SOSEX
self-energy that we name $GW$+2SOSEX-psd. To reach this goal, we demonstrate
the cancellation of the bare energy poles that are contained in the fully
dynamic second-order in $W$ self-energy ($G3W2$). We then demonstrate on
molecular examples the correct positive semi-definiteness of the proposed
self-energy approximation and its good accuracy in predicting accurate
quasiparticle energies for valence and core states.

Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite
groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of
our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to
projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology,
representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective
representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known
as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on
commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have
important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that
cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to
distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$
symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate
how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We
show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host
nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a
lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32
without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.

TL;DR: The SLMC method leverages machine learning to enhance Monte Carlo sampling, significantly improving efficiency, especially near critical regions, and has wide applications across quantum and other fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The method addresses the challenge of slow convergence and increased computational complexity in Monte Carlo simulations, particularly near phase transitions, by integrating machine learning to optimize the sampling process.

Method: SLMC uses machine learning models built from conventional Monte Carlo configurations to propose global updates, reducing autocorrelation time and maintaining statistical accuracy through a cumulative update scheme that satisfies detailed balance.

Result: Applications in condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum simulations show that SLMC achieves faster convergence with improved accuracy compared to traditional methods, especially near critical regions.

Conclusion: SLMC represents a significant advancement in Monte Carlo methods, offering a scalable and versatile framework that expands the scope of numerical studies for strongly correlated systems beyond conventional techniques limitations.

Abstract: The Self-Learning Monte Carlo (SLMC) method is a Monte Carlo approach that
has emerged in recent years by integrating concepts from machine learning with
conventional Monte Carlo techniques. Designed to accelerate the numerical study
of interacting many-body systems, SLMC significantly improves sampling
efficiency by constructing an effective model -- via machine learning methods
-- based on configurations generated by conventional Monte Carlo methods and
then proposes global updates based on the effective model. This enhancement
leads to a substantial reduction in autocorrelation time, especially near the
critical region, where traditional methods typically suffer from critical
slowing down and increased computation complexity. Moreover, SLMC maintains
statistical accuracy by implementing a cumulative update scheme that rigorously
satisfies the detailed balance condition. And more recent applications have
extended the SLMC to convolutional neural networks with applications not only
in condensed matter physics but also high-energy physics, quantum chemistry,
and quantum simulations. The generic applicability and high computational
efficiency make SLMC a powerful and scalable framework for quantum Monte Carlo
simulations of strongly correlated electron systems, extending the reach of
numerical investigations beyond the limitations of conventional techniques.

*Jonathon Kruppe,Josue Rodriguez,Catherine Xu,James Analytis,Joseph Orenstein,Veronika Sunko*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper studies the magnetic properties of CoₓTaS₂ with varying x. At x=1/3, only one magnetic transition occurs, but lower x values show two transitions with the AHE observed in the lower temperature phase. They use magneto-optical techniques like EPR, magneto-calorimetry, and Kerr microscopy to resolve spin structures, with anisotropic (2+1)Q states and time-reversal asymmetry playing a key role in the AHE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Co TaS2 is a promising material for spintronic applications, and understanding its magnetic properties under varying composition is crucial for optimizing its functionality.

Method: The researchers used a suite of magneto-optical probes such as EPR, Kerr microscopy, and magneto-calorimetry to study the spin structures and phase transitions in CoₓTaS₂, identifying the (2+1)Q state and the AHE activity.

Result: The compounds with lower x display two magnetic transitions and exhibit the anomalous Hall effect. The spin structure analysis reveals that the AHE is linked to scalar spin chirality and the anisotropic (2+1)Q state, expanding the classification of multi-Q magnetic phases.

Conclusion: This work provides detailed insights into the magnetic phases and mechanisms in CoₓTaS₂, which could lead to new spintronic applications by optimizing material composition and understanding the AHE mechanism through (2+1)Q states and time-reversal asymmetry.

Abstract: The cobalt-intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Co$_x$TaS$_2$ hosts a
rich landscape of magnetic phases that depend sensitively on $x$. While the
stoichiometric compound with $x=1/3$ exhibits a single magnetic transition,
samples with $x\leq 0.325$ display two transitions with an anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) emerging in the lower temperature phase. Here, we resolve the spin
structure in each phase by employing a suite of magneto-optical probes that
include the discovery of anomalous magneto-birefringence -- a spontaneous
time-reversal sensitive rotation of the principal optic axes. A symmetry-based
analysis identifies the AHE-active phase as an anisotropic (2+1)\textbf{Q}
state, in which magnetic modulation at one wavevector (\textbf{Q}) differs in
symmetry from that at the remaining two. The (2+1)\textbf{Q} state naturally
exhibits scalar spin chirality as a mechanism for the AHE and expands the
classification of multi-Q magnetic phases.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the crystal electric field (CEF) excitations in YbZn2GaO5 using inelastic neutron scattering. They observe three CEF excitations with significant broadening, attributed to heterogeneous coordination due to Ga³+/Zn²+ site mixing. First-principles calculations support the model, and the study suggests disorder significantly affects the magnetism of the material, including low-energy excitations and absence of magnetic ordering. The results extend understanding of rare-earth-based antiferromagnets with structural disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the magnetism of rare-earth materials, specifically Yb-based antiferromagnets, is crucial for both fundamental physics and potential applications in spintronics and quantum devices. Structural disorder plays a key role in their unusual magnetic properties.

Method: The researchers used inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to study CEF excitations and neutron powder diffraction for structural analysis. They performed Rietveld refinement and point charge modeling to analyze the broadening and site mixing effects. First-principles calculations were used to validate the findings and explore the structural distortions.

Result: CEF excitations were observed with broadening due to site mixing of Ga³+/Zn²+ ions, and the distortions in YbO6 octahedra were supported by first-principles calculations. The study identifies disorder as a critical factor in the unusual magnetism observed in YbZn2GaO5.

Conclusion: The presence of Ga³+/Zn²+ site disorder significantly affects the crystal electric field excitations of Yb³+ ions in YbZn2GaO5, leading to broadened peaks and structural distortions. This disorder is a key contributor to the material's unusual magnetic behavior, including the absence of long-range magnetic order at low temperatures and the presence of low-energy magnetic excitations.

Abstract: We investigate the crystal electric field (CEF) excitations of Yb$^{3+}$ ions
in powder samples of the triangular-lattice rare-earth-based antiferromagnet
YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ using inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Three CEF excitations
from the ground-state Kramers doublet were observed, each exhibiting
significant broadening beyond instrumental resolution. Combining
temperature-dependent INS and neutron powder diffraction, we identify a
significant static contribution to this broadening and attribute it to
heterogeneous coordination of Yb$^{3+}$ ions due to Ga$^{3+}$/Zn$^{2+}$ site
mixing. Rietveld refinement of neutron powder diffraction indicates that 35% of
Ga occupies the Zn site and 60% of Zn occupies the Ga site. We show with a
point charge model for the CEF Hamiltonian that heterogeneous coordination of
Yb$^{3+}$ ions leads to broadened CEF peaks. First-principles calculations
demonstrate that the random Ga$^{3+}$/Zn$^{2+}$ distribution can produce the
distortions of the YbO$_6$ octahedra observed from neutron diffraction. Because
the documented heterogeneity will extend to exchange interactions, our results
suggest that disorder is a significant factor in the unusual magnetism
previously reported in YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$, including broad low-energy magnetic
excitations and the absence of magnetic ordering down to 0.3K.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-flavor extension of the Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method to address the computational expense of quantum impurity solvers with many impurity flavors by efficiently integrating out non-target flavors, demonstrating scalability and accuracy up to three impurity orbitals, leveraging tensor network techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the computational efficiency of quantum impurity solvers is crucial for tackling larger systems, especially with growing number of impurity flavors, making this research relevant.

Method: The authors propose a multi-flavor method within the Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator framework by integrating out non-target degrees of freedom to simplify calculations, particularly effective for diagonal hybridization functions. They benchmark against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo.

Result: The method shows accurate results for up to three impurity orbitals (6 flavors) and demonstrates scalability by comparing results with Monte Carlo simulations, paving the way for larger quantum systems.

Conclusion: This method effectively reduces computational complexity, enabling the solution of large-scale quantum impurity problems that were previously intractable.

Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great
potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors
can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary-
and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational
cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we
propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key
insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few
impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest
flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is
particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal
hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent
bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the
accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of
impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and
benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve
large-scale quantum impurity problems.

Abstract: Spinel-structured compounds serve as prototypical examples of highly
frustrated systems, and are promising candidates for realizing the long-sought
quantum spin liquid (QSL) state. However, structural disorder is inevitable in
many real QSL candidates and its impact remains a topic of intense debate. In
this work, we conduct comprehensive investigations on CuGa$_2$O$_4$, a spinel
compound with significant structural disorder, focusing on its thermodynamic
properties and spectroscopic behaviors. No long-range magnetic order is
observed down to $\sim$80 mK, as evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, specific
heat and elastic neutron scattering measurements. More intriguingly, inelastic
neutron scattering experiments reveal a broad gapless continuum of magnetic
excitations around the Brillouin zone boundary, resembling the magnetic
excitation spectra expected for a QSL. Nevertheless, a spin-freezing transition
at $T_{\rm{f}} \approx $ 0.88 K is identified from the cusp in the dc
susceptibility curves, where a bifurcation between zero-field-cooling and
field-cooling curves occurs. Furthermore, ac susceptibility measurements show a
peak close to $T_{\rm{f}}$ at low frequency, which shifts to higher temperature
with increasing frequency. These results are evident that CuGa$_2$O$_4$ has
spin-glass ground state, consistent with the establishment of short-range order
inferred from the specific heat measurements. Collectively, these results
illustrate the crucial role of disorder in defining the excitation spectrum out
of the disordered ground state. Our findings shed light onto the broader class
of AB$_2$O$_4$ spinels and advance our understanding of the spin dynamics in
magnetically disordered systems.

Abstract: The heavy fermion compound CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ has recently shown to exhibit a
spontaneous nonlinear Hall effect, indicating its topological nature. This is
consistent with the lack of inversion symmetry that allows for the existence of

I or II, each having sixteen symmetry-related replicas. These Weyl nodes bridge
the Kondo insulating gap, which is a direct but not an indirect gap. The
closest Weyl points is only 0.5meV below the Fermi energy, and has a flat

### [29] [Suppression of the charge fluctuations by nonlocal correlations close to the Mott transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13288)
*Irakli Titvinidze,Julian Stobbe,Marvin Leusch,Georg Rohringer*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper examines the effect of nonlocal correlations on charge fluctuations in the Hubbard model near the Mott transition. DMFT overestimates charge susceptibility due to ignoring nonlocal effects, while DΓA shows suppression near half-filling and enhanced mobility at higher doping. The study highlights the importance of nonlocal correlations in understanding charge transport in two dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is significant because it addresses how nonlocal correlations affect charge fluctuations in a Hubbard model near the Mott transition, which is crucial for understanding metal-to-insulator phase transitions and charge carrier mobility.

Method: The research employs both DMFT and DΓA, with the latter accounting for nonlocal correlations. They analyze the effects on charge susceptibility, mobility, and energy components.

Result: The findings indicate that nonlocal correlations suppress charge fluctuations near half-filling and enhance charge mobility at higher doping. This contradicts DMFT's predictions when only local correlations are considered.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that nonlocal correlations significantly influence charge transport, providing a more accurate description of systems undergoing metal-to-insulator transitions and highlighting the importance of including nonlocal effects in theoretical models.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of nonlocal correlations on charge
fluctuations in the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model close to the Mott
metal-to-insulator transition. At half-filling and for interaction strengths
and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge
fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the
charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT
results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the
importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence,
carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) simulations which allow
for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the
local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the
large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal
fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain
doping value charge fluctuations become eventually larger in D$\Gamma$A with
respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations
underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime.
This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\Gamma$A
kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute
value of the) D$\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了ATLAS内层追踪器组件在单独稳态 thermocycling 下的关键机械故障。结果显示大部分组件在升温到40°C时出现明显的形变，而降到-44°C时则出现传感器断裂。通过添加硅胶衬里层和Kapton films, 一些组件在高温下显示更好的耐受性。然而，长时间的反复 thermocycling 会导致传感器形变减小甚至断裂。研究者建议在设计此类设备时需考虑材料热稳定性。

Abstract: This paper investigates critical mechanical failures during stand-alone
thermocycling of ATLAS Inner Tracker strip pre-production modules. Five modules
undergo extended thermocycling after adequately levelling thermal chucks and
introducing interlocks for unattended operation. Module bow evolution is
tracked via regular sensor metrology. All five modules exhibit bow increases
with a mean of $146\pm 27~\mu$m when raising maximum cycling temperatures from
$20^\circ$C to $40^\circ$C. Four such modules exhibit sensor fractures when
cycled to $-44^\circ$C. A stress-mitigating layer of silicone gel and Kapton
film interposer is introduced to three further modules, with detailed quality
control data establishing electromechanical viability. No significant bow
change of $1\pm 10~\mu$m is observed after ten cycles between $[+40,
-44]^\circ$C relative to $[+20, -44]^\circ$C. Two interposer modules undergo
200 thermocycles up to $[+56, -44]^\circ$C without fracturing. This decreased
sensor deformation and fracturing is interpreted as evidence for reduced
thermal stress.

TL;DR: This paper reports an experimental observation of nonreciprocal optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in ZnSe under Voigt geometry, induced by an external magnetic field. The SHG intensity shows a nonreciprocal dependence on the magnetic field direction, explained by interference between crystallographic and field-induced SHG signals.

Motivation: The paper focuses on the interaction between light, magnetic fields, and exciton-polaritons in semiconductors, which is a fascinating area in nonlinear optics and spintronics. The observation of nonreciprocal SHG could have implications for devices like spin-waveguides or magnonics.

Method: They used bulk ZnSe crystals in a Voigt setup with an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the light wave vector. They measured SHG intensity and analyzed it using interference of SHG signals and rotational anisotropy diagrams.

Result: They successfully observed nonreciprocal SHG in ZnSe, noting the dependency on magnetic field direction and the interference of two SHG sources. They also created both phenomenological and microscopic models.

Conclusion: This is the first experiment demonstrating nonreciprocal SHG in semiconductors for exciton-polaritons, opening new avenues for future research and applications in nonlinear optical devices.

Abstract: We report on the optical second harmonic generation (SHG) on the 1S
exciton-polariton resonance in bulk ZnSe that is subject to an external
magnetic field applied perpendicular to the light wave vector $\mathbf k$
(Voigt geometry). For the symmetry allowed geometry with the
$\mathbf{k}\parallel[111]$ crystal axes, the nonreciprocal dependence of the
SHG intensity on the magnetic field direction is found. It is explained by an
interference of the crystallographic and magnetic-field-induced SHG signals.
Relative phases of these signals are evaluated from the rotational anisotropy
diagrams. Phenomenological and microscopic models of the effect are developed.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of the
nonreciprocal SHG in semiconductor crystals, and the first one for
exciton-polaritons.

Abstract: We report on the possibility of manipulating magnetic materials by using
itinerant orbital angular momentum to produce out-of-plane spin polarization in
van der Waals heterostructures. Employing a real-space formulation of the OAM
operator within linear response theory, we demonstrate that in low-symmetry
transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, such as 1$T{}_d$-MoTe2, the
current-induced itinerant OAM exceeds the spin response by three orders of
magnitude. When TMDs are coupled with ferromagnets with negligible intrinsic
orbital responses, the itinerant OAM generated by the orbital Rashba-Edelstein
effect transfers across the interface, generating spin densities capable of
inducing magnetization dynamics inside the ferromagnet. Our findings highlight
the previously overlooked role of itinerant OAM in the generation of
out-of-plane spin densities, which serves as an emerging mechanism for
efficient electrical control of magnetization in low-power, ultracompact
storage devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a significant gap in understanding spin relaxation in quantum systems, offering a framework for coherent description.

Method: Quantum hydrodynamics approach for two-component liquids is used to derive equations incorporating energy and spin relaxations.

Result: Polariton dynamics and dispersion in magnetic fields and uniform condensates are analyzed, showing effects of spin relaxation.

Conclusion: The framework provides tools for studying spinor condensates beyond cavity polaritons.

Abstract: Cavity polaritons, the elementary excitations appearing in quantum
microcavities in the strong-coupling regime, reveal clear signatures of quantum
collective behavior. The combination of unique spin structure and strong
nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of
a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena. Spin relaxation
processes are of crucial importance here. However, a mathematical formalism for
their coherent description is still absent. In the present paper, based on the
quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of
the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear
naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor
polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of
elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on
the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of
spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major
role.

Conclusion: 施加外电场优化了量子点的性能，有效降低了阻尼耗散，为量子通信和量子计算提供了理论依据和实验支持。

Abstract: The generation of indistinguishable single photons is a fundamental
requirement for future quantum technologies, particularly in quantum repeater
networks and for distributed quantum computing based on entanglement
distribution. However, spectral jitter, often induced by charge noise in
epitaxial quantum dots, leads to exciton dephasing, thereby limiting their
practical usage in quantum applications. We present a straightforward approach
to mitigate charge noise-induced decoherence in droplet-etched GaAs quantum
dots embedded in an n-i-p diode structure and integrated deterministically into
an electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonator for emission
enhancement. The quantum device allows for the stabilization of the charge
environment by applying an external electrical field while producing a photon
extraction efficiency of approximately (37 +- 2)%. Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon
interference measurements reveal a strong voltage dependence of the exciton
dephasing time and interference visibility on the applied bias in excellent
agreement with our theoretical predictions. Notably, the reduction in
visibility from a maximum, charge-stabilized corrected value of 97 percent at
the optimum bias point follows an inverse square dependence (proportional to
1/I^2) with increasing diode current (I) in forward direction. Under a
quasi-resonant excitation scheme, we achieve a maximum exciton dephasing time
(T2*) of approximately (6.8 +-0.5) ns, reaching nearly the Fourier limit (T2 =
2T1) without the need for complex echo schemes like Ramsey or
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences. These findings are consistent with
theoretical predictions from rate equation modeling and quantum optical
analysis as well as voltage-dependent linewidth measurements, demonstrating
optimized electrical control of exciton dephasing.

Motivation: The paper explores innovative spintronic devices using antiferromagnetic materials to surpass traditional magnetic tunnel junctions, offering potential advancements in high-performance devices.

Method: The study utilized van der Waals A-type AFM metal electrodes with nonmagnetic WSe2 barriers to create AFMTJs. They measured the TMR ratio, analyzed the AFM and FM states, and explored spin-dependent switching mechanisms through experimental and theoretical methods.

Result: The AFMTJs showed a significant TMR ratio of 75%, TMR emerged specifically in AFM states, and two distinct spin-polarized transport mechanisms were identified based on electrode configurations.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for AFM-based spintronics, enabling efficient TMR through interface-specific spin-dependent transport and setting a foundation for future device innovations.

Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance
spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but
significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by
exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report
all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals
A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic
semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves
a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic
field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in
the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By
engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations,
volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely
interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by N\'eel vector
switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial
spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism
associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the
spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear
AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a
new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM
interfaces are harnessed.

Abstract: The Euler class is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariant that
characterizes a pair of real bands in a two-dimensional Brillouin zone. One of
the symmetries that permits its definition is $C_{2z}T$, where $C_{2z}$ denotes
a twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and $T$ denotes time-reversal symmetry.
Here, we study three-dimensional spinless insulators characterized by the Euler
class, focusing on the case where additional $C_{4z}$ or $C_{6z}$ rotational
symmetry is present, and investigate the relationship between the Euler class
of the occupied bands and their rotation eigenvalues. We first consider
two-dimensional systems and clarify the transformation rules for the real Berry
connection and curvature under point group operations, using the corresponding
sewing matrices. Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we
obtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation
eigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to
three-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class
between the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that
relate the difference in the Euler class to two types of
representation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We
further construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to
support our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving understanding of thermodynamic behavior in quantum systems and nanostructures through Coulomb interaction.

Method: Used cross-correlation measurements of single-electron dynamics to estimate Coulomb interaction strength and converted it to heat transfer statistics.

Result: Obtained fluctuating net-zero heat transfer statistics at equilibrium, useful for device functionality analysis and verifying thermodynamic relations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates how Coulomb interactions can be used for heat transfer analysis, opening new research avenues in quantum and nanostructures.

Abstract: Heat transfer mediated by the Coulomb interaction reveals unconventional
thermodynamic behavior and broadens thermodynamics research into fields such as
quantum dynamics and information engineering. Although some experimental
demonstrations of phenomena utilizing Coulomb-mediated heat transfer have been
reported, estimations of their performance, such as efficiency, and their
theoretical evaluations necessitate qualitative evaluation of the transfer
mechanism itself, which remains challenging. We present an experiment
investigating single-electron dynamics in two electrostatically coupled silicon
nanodots to quantify Coulomb-mediated heat transfer at the nanoscale. By
estimating the Coulomb interaction strength between the dots using the
cross-correlation measurements of the single-electron dynamics, we convert the
single-electron dynamics into the statistics of Coulomb-mediated heat transfer.
Conducting the experiment at equilibrium enabled us to obtain a fluctuating
net-zero heat transfer between the dots. These heat transfer statistics are
essential for exploring device functionalities from the perspective of
stochastic thermodynamics and for verifying universal relations in
nonequilibrium states.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots
under linearly polarized optical pulses, focusing on excitonic effects.
Combining the tight-binding model and the single-particle density matrix
approach, we derive a semiconductor Bloch equation under a static-screened
Hartree-Fock approximation. This framework characterizes the electron-electron
interaction through local Hartree potentials for direct Coulomb interaction and
nonlocal Fock potentials for exchange interaction. Distinct confgurations of
Hartree and Fock terms yield various approximation methods, including
independent-particle approximation, mean-feld approximation, random phase
approximation, and excitonic effects. We thoroughly analyze how these
approximation methods affect the electronic energy levels, linear optical
absorption, and nonlinear harmonic generation. Within excitonic effects, we
present the dependence of harmonic generation on the geometric variations of
graphene quantum dots (sizes, triangular/hexagonal shapes, and armchair/zigzag
edges) and the amplitude and polarization of electric fields. Our findings show
that excitonic effects significantly enhance optical responses of graphene
nanostructures. For a dot ensemble formed by randomly oriented graphene quantum
dots,
  only odd-order harmonics exist along the polarization direction of the
incident light. Crucially, harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots
exhibits high tunability via geometric configuration, making them promising
candidates for nonlinear optical nanodevices.

Method: Planar tunneling spectroscopy measurements on metal-WSe₂-twisted bilayer graphene heterostructures across varying gate and bias voltages.

Result: Enhanced phonon-assisted tunneling is observed in twisted bilayer graphene compared to Bernal bilayer, attributed to more relaxed in-plane momentum matching. Phonon-dispersion theoretical calculations identify low-energy phonon modes explaining the mechanism.

Conclusion: Planar tunneling offers a versatile method to study electron-phonon coupling in twisted van der Waals materials, highlighting the role of phonon modes.

Abstract: We report planar tunneling spectroscopy measurements on metal-WSe$_2$-twisted
bilayer graphene heterostructures across a broad range of gate and bias
voltages. The observed experimental features are attributed to phonon-assisted
tunneling and the significantly high density of states within the moir\'e
bands. A notable finding is the enhanced phonon-assisted tunneling in twisted
bilayer graphene compared to Bernal bilayer graphene, which arises from a more
relaxed in-plane momentum matching criterion. Theoretical calculations of
phonon dispersions enable us to identify low-energy phonon modes in both Bernal
and twisted bilayers of graphene, thereby elucidating the underlying mechanism
of tunneling. Our results establish planar tunneling as a versatile tool to
further understand electron-phonon coupling in twisted van der Waals materials.

Abstract: Heat transfer is a critical aspect of modern electronics, and a deeper
understanding of the underlying physics is essential for building faster,
smaller, and more powerful devices with an improved performance and efficiency.
In such nanoscale structures the heat transfer between two materials is limited
by the finite thermal boundary conductance across their interface. Using
ultrafast electron diffraction under grazing incidence we investigated the heat
transfer from ultrathin epitaxial Pb films to an Si(111) substrate under strong
non-equilibrium conditions. Applying an intense femtosecond laser pulse, the
5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while the Si
substrate remains cold at $\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature
discontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited
Pb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained
through the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse
mismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a
factor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates,
pointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, film and their
interface.

Abstract: The quest for efficient and scalable thermoelectric materials has catalyzed
intense interest in quasi 1D nanoribbons, where reduced dimensionality and
structural tunability can decouple key transport parameters to enhance energy
conversion. In this work, we present a unified comparative study of the
thermopower in armchair nanoribbons derived from five archetypal 2D materials:
graphene, silicene, germanene, stanene and phosphorene. Using a tight binding
model parametrized by first principles inputs and solved within the Landauer
Buttiker formalism, we compute strain and width dependent thermopower across
nanoribbons classified by width families (3p, 3p+1, 3p+2) over a wide range of
uniaxial tensile strain. Our results reveal that thermoelectric behavior is
governed by a complex interplay of bandgap evolution, chemical potential
asymmetry, and quantum confinement. While graphene and silicene exhibit
pronounced family and width sensitive thermopower enhancement under moderate
strain, heavier Xenes such as germanene and stanene show diminished responses.
In particular, phosphorene nanoribbons emerge as exceptional, exhibiting
remarkably high thermopower (62 kB/e), a consequence of their large, persistent
bandgap and anisotropic electronic structure. Across all systems, the 3p+2
family transitions from near-metallic to semiconducting under strain, enabling
dramatic activation of thermopower in previously inactive configurations. This
systematic cross material analysis delineates the design principles for the
optimization of TE in 1D nanoribbons, highlighting the strategic use of width
control and strain engineering. Our findings identify phosphorene as an
intrinsically superior thermoelectric material and position strained Xene
nanoribbons as promising candidates for tunable, low-dimensional thermoelectric
devices.

*Bruno Bertin-Johannet,Thibaut Thuégaz,Janine Splettstoesser,Robert S. Whitney*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel four-terminal photovoltaic cell design that theoretically outperforms two-terminal cells by collecting 'hot' carriers faster than they relax, leading to a significant increase in power output. This concept could also have applications in multi-terminal thermoelectric systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is the exploration of advanced photovoltaic cell designs beyond the traditional two-terminal structures. The authors aim to improve energy conversion efficiency by leveraging the collection of high-energy carriers (hot carriers) through a four-terminal system, which theoretically exceeds the carrier-phonon relaxation time.

Method: The study employs theoretical modeling to predict the performance of four-terminal photovoltaic cells. The methodology involves calculating the efficiency gains by considering the faster collection of 'hot' carriers and comparing it to optimal two-terminal cells. Additionally, the potential applications in multi-terminal thermoelectric systems are explored using similar thermodynamic principles.

Result: The paper finds that four-terminal photovoltaic cells have a predicted power output increase of more than 40% compared to optimal two-terminal cells when 'hot' carriers are collected faster than carrier-phonon relaxation. Furthermore, the concept shows promise for enhancing multi-terminal thermoelectric systems by exploiting non-equilibrium carrier distributions.

Conclusion: The research suggests a promising direction for advancing photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies by introducing multi-terminal systems that can theoretically surpass traditional two-terminal designs in efficiency and energy conversion capabilities.

Abstract: Photovoltaic cells usually have two terminals, one collecting electrons and
the other collecting holes. Can more terminals improve such solar cells?
Energy-filtering terminals could collect "hot" carriers (electrons or holes not
yet relaxed to the band edge), with other terminals for low-energy carriers.
For collection faster than carrier-phonon relaxation, we predict four-terminal
cells with higher power output than optimal two-terminal cells -- more than 40%
higher for fast carrier collection. Similar effects will occur in
multi-terminal thermoelectrics exploiting non-equilibrium distributions

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for
individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of
dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been
explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle

noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness
of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can
transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for
biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on
advancing healthcare technology.

Abstract: Conventional spectral probes of quantum chaos require eigenvalues, and
sometimes, eigenvectors of the quantum Hamiltonian. This involves
computationally expensive diagonalization procedures. We test whether an
unsupervised neural network can detect quantum chaos directly from the
Hamiltonian matrix. We use a single-body Hamiltonian with an underlying random
graph structure and random coupling constants, with a parameter that determines
the randomness of the graph. The spectral analysis shows that increasing the
amount of randomness in the underlying graph results in a transition from
integrable spectral statistics to chaotic ones. We show that the same
transition can be detected via unsupervised neural networks, or more
specifically, Self-Organizing Maps by feeding the Hamiltonian matrix directly
into the neural network, without any diagonalization procedure.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines
quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model
training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum
noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices
experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and

performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework
that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in
distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies
based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability,
and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches,
achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a resource-efficient method for quantum simulation of 2+1D quantum link lattice gauge theories using qudits. It eliminates the need for qubits and reduces resource overhead by reformulating the model and introduces scalable circuits for various spin representations, demonstrating improved performance compared to qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum simulation of high-energy physics on quantum hardware is a significant goal. High-dimensional lattice gauge theories, especially in 2+1D and 3+1D, are crucial for understanding quantum chromodynamics and other complex systems. However, existing implementations often face limitations in scalability and resource efficiency, which makes this paper's contribution highly relevant.

Method: The paper's method involves reformulating the quantum link model using qudits, integrating out matter fields via Gauss's law, and developing scalable circuit constructions for higher spin representations. They also demonstrate improved performance under realistic noise conditions compared to qubits.

Result: The approach shows significant resource reduction and scalability, with numerical simulations validates the accuracy of first-order Trotterized circuits even with noise. The method is applicable to various spin cases and real-world quantum hardware.

Conclusion: This paper provides a promising framework for advancing quantum simulations in high-energy physics by enabling more efficient and scalable models using qudits, which can handle higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories with improved fidelity and resource efficiency.

Abstract: A major challenge in the burgeoning field of quantum simulation for
high-energy physics is the realization of scalable $2+1$D lattice gauge
theories on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, which is an essential step
towards the overarching goal of probing $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics on a
quantum computer. Despite great progress, current experimental implementations
of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small
system sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields.
Here, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D
spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical
matter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter
fields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely
spin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial
dimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource
overhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits
for the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the
first-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in
the presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general
method for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations
$S>1/2$. Compared to conventional qubit encodings, our framework significantly
reduces the number of quantum resources and gate count. Our approach
significantly enhances scalability and fidelity for probing nonequilibrium
phenomena in higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories, and is readily amenable
to implementation on state-of-the-art qudit platforms.

Abstract: Magic state distillation enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computation
by implementing non-Clifford gates via the preparation of high-fidelity magic
states. However, it comes at the cost of substantial logical-level overhead in
both space and time. In this work, we propose a very low-cost magic state
distillation scheme for biased-noise qubits. By leveraging the noise bias, our
scheme enables the preparation of a magic state with a logical error rate of $3
\times 10^{-7}$, using only 53 qubits and 5.5 error correction rounds, under a
noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 5 \times 10^6$ and a phase-flip noise rate of
$0.1\%$. This reduces the circuit volume by more than one order of magnitude
relative to magic state cultivation for unbiased-noise qubits and by more than
two orders of magnitude relative to standard magic state distillation.
Moreover, our scheme provides three key advantages over previous proposals for
biased-noise qubits. First, it only requires nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates
on a 2D lattice. Second, the logical fidelity remains nearly identical even at
a more modest noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 80$, at the cost of a slightly
increased circuit volume. Third, the scheme remains effective even at high
physical phase-flip rates, in contrast to previously proposed approaches whose
circuit volume grows exponentially with the error rate. Our construction is
based on unfolding the $X$ stabilizer group of the Hadamard 3D quantum
Reed-Muller code in 2D, enabling distillation at the physical level rather than
the logical level, and is therefore referred to as $\textit{unfolded}$
distillation.

Abstract: An overarching goal in the flourishing field of quantum simulation for
high-energy physics is the first-principles study of the microscopic dynamics
of scattering processes on a quantum computer. Currently, this is hampered by
small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge
fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient
experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium
quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where
the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using
dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on
these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson
collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the
fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering
processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics
showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission
transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling
strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing
and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics,
signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic
scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their

Abstract: Harnessing quantum resources in the atomic external degrees of
freedom--particularly matter-wave states with broad momentum spreads--holds
significant potential for enhancing the sensitivity of Kasevich-Chu atom
gravimeters at the standard quantum limit. However, a fully quantum-mechanical
investigation of the critical Doppler effect inherent to this approach remains
lacking. Employing the SU(2) Lie group theory, we derive a generic Riccati
equation governing the unitary dynamics of the Rabi model within a linear
potential and analyze the Doppler effect impact on Rabi oscillations because of
the strong coupling between the internal and external states. Furthermore, by
integrating Fisher information theory, we specifically demonstrate the
near-universality and high metrological gain of phase rotation measurement
protocols under strong Doppler broadening. This theoretical work provides
insightful implications for boarder generalization, such as extensions to
finite-temperature scenarios or multi-pulse sequences--exemplified by the
$\pi/2-\pi-\pi/2$ pulse sequence characteristic of Kasevich-Chu atom
gravimeters. Thus, this work lays a theoretical foundation for developing
high-sensitivity, noise-resistant atom gravimeters leveraging external-state
quantum resources.

Abstract: Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most efficient process to synthesize
graphene sheets using methane as precursor, making it a strategic alternative
route for the Liquefied Natural Gas market. In this reaction, tetracyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (TAH) are produced as residual and intermediary
molecules. Sorting a combinatorial space of variants of TAHs by energy is a
poorly studied problem needed to optimize CVD, while it is also a candidate for
quantum advantage in quantum computers. We extend on Sridhara's polynomial root
formula to perform block-diagonalization (hence SBD) of six TAHs using
Hartree-Fock Hamiltonians with STO-3G basis set and active orbital space
growing from 2 to 6 orbitals, with equal numbers for the number of active
electrons. We show that the proposed compression algorithm followed by
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) allows for sorting of the molecules by
ground state energy, while speeding up the VQE simulation up to tenfold and
reducing its error to the $10^{-1}$ scale. The compression capability of
$(1-2^{-k})\cdot 100\%$ in matrix size for $k$ qubits allows VQEs to have a
broader set of applications, providing a new and necessary tool to overcome the
circuit size and quantum noise limitations of large quantum processing units.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a hybrid quantum network design that combines optical fibers and satellite-based entanglement distribution to overcome limitations in both, achieving high-fidelity quantum communication over long distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for secure communication, distributed computing, and precise sensing has driven the development of quantum networks. Existing methods are limited by physical constraints, so a hybrid approach is proposed to enhance performance.

Method: The proposed hybrid network combines optical fiber-based distribution for local areas and satellite-based for long distances. It aims to mitigate the limitations of each method, such as fiber attenuation and atmospheric issues.

Result: The design shows potential for high-fidelity entanglement distribution across continents or globally, improving applications like key distribution and computing.

Conclusion: By integrating both optical and satellite-based methods, the paper presents a scalable quantum network solution that surpasses current limitations and offers significant advancements in quantum communication technology.

Abstract: Quantum networks hold promise for key distribution, private and distributed
computing, and quantum sensing, among other applications. The scale of such
networks for ground users is currently limited by one's ability to distribute
entanglement between distant locations. This can in principle be carried out by
transmitting entangled photons through optical fibers or satellites. The former
is limited by fiber optic attenuation while the latter is limited by
atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and
protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to
high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.

Conclusion: 时空旋转的对偶性可以统一SU和MF两种校准电路，这一发现提供了理解这两种量子计算资源新方法的途径，并为仅需常数深度读出的量子phrase提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states
are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local
unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF)
circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based
on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF
circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this
spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states,
including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal
symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to
a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier
duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF
circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which
equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further
propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to
measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i)
measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous
symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced
long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological
phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower
bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Solitons - localized wave packets that travel without spreading - play a
central role in understanding transport and properties of nonlinear systems,
from optical fibers to fluid dynamics. In quantum many-body systems, however,
such robust excitations are typically destroyed by thermalization. Here, we
theoretically demonstrate the existence of solitonic excitations in high-energy
states of Rydberg atom chains in the regime of strong nearest-neighbor Rydberg
blockade. These localized wave packets propagate directionally atop a special
class of reviving initial states related to quantum many-body scars and are
capable of carrying energy. Exhibiting long coherence times, these states
constitute a novel type of non-ergodic quantum dynamics and can be efficiently
implemented on Rydberg atom simulators. In addition to a phenomenological
description of solitons, we identify their counterpart in a classical nonlinear
dynamical system obtained from a variational projection of the quantum
dynamics. We demonstrate the potential use of solitons in quantum information
transfer and conjecture their relevance for the anomalous energy transport
reported in numerical studies of Rydberg atom arrays.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Free fermionic Gaussian, a.k.a. matchgate, random circuits exhibit atypical
behavior compared to generic interacting systems. They produce anomalously slow
entanglement growth, characterized by diffusive scaling $S(t) \sim \sqrt{t}$,
and evolve into volume-law entangled states at late times, $S \sim N$, which
are highly unstable to measurements. Here, we investigate how doping such
circuits with non-Gaussian resources (gates) restores entanglement structures
of typical dynamics. We demonstrate that ballistic entanglement growth $S(t)
\sim t$ is recovered after injecting an extensive total amount of non-Gaussian
gates, also restoring Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. When the evolution is
perturbed with measurements, we uncover a measurement-induced phase transition
between an area-law and a power-law entangled phase, $S \sim N^\alpha$, with
$\alpha$ controlled by the doping. A genuine volume-law entangled phase is
recovered only when non-Gaussian gates are injected at an extensive rate. Our
findings bridge the dynamics of free and interacting fermionic systems,
identifying non-Gaussianity as a key resource driving the emergence of
non-integrable behavior.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) are essential for quantum processing with better noise performance and cryogenic compatibility than conventional amplifiers. The paper compares JPA types and designs advanced JPA architectures to overcome challenges like gain compression and phase noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the role of JPAs in quantum systems and optimize their design for better performance.

Method: The study compares different JPA types and designs using Josephson junction arrays and advanced architectures.

Result: The study found that JPA designs using Josephson junction arrays outperform single-junction JPAs in several aspects.

Conclusion: JPAs are ideal for cryogenic quantum applications, and advanced designs improve their performance.

Abstract: Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) are key components in quantum
information processing due to their ability to amplify weak quantum signals
with near-quantum-limited noise performance. This is essential for applications
such as qubit readout, quantum sensing, and communication, where signal
fidelity and coherence preservation are critical. Unlike CMOS and HEMT
amplifiers used in conventional RF systems, JPAs are specifically optimized for
millikelvin (mK) cryogenic environments. CMOS amplifiers offer good integration
but perform poorly at ultra-low temperatures due to high noise. HEMT amplifiers
provide better noise performance but are power-intensive and less suited for mK
operation. JPAs, by contrast, combine low power consumption with ultra-low
noise and excellent cryogenic compatibility, making them ideal for quantum
systems. The first part of this study compares these RF amplifier types and
explains why JPAs are preferred in cryogenic quantum applications. The second
part focuses on the design and analysis of JPAs based on both single Josephson
junctions and junction arrays. While single-junction JPAs utilize nonlinear
inductance for amplification, they suffer from gain compression, limited
dynamic range, and sensitivity to fabrication variations. To overcome these
challenges, this work explores JPA designs using Josephson junction arrays.
Arrays distribute the nonlinear response, enhancing power handling, linearity,
impedance tunability, and coherence while reducing phase noise. Several
advanced JPA architectures are proposed, simulated, and compared using quantum
theory and CAD tools to assess performance trade-offs and improvements over
conventional designs.

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable dissipative quantum error correction (QEC) protocol that addresses the challenge of high scalability in correcting multi-qubit errors. It introduces a trickle-down mechanism with sequential error reduction and improves correction efficiency by exploiting redundancy in Knill-Laflamme conditions. The protocol demonstrates significant efficiency gains, particularly at realistic physical error rates, and connects QEC with bosonic codes and traditional measurement-feedback QEC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability is a key issue in quantum computing, particularly in quantum error correction. This paper aims to address the challenge of high-weight errors requiring increased dissipation rates and exponentially many correction operators by presenting a scalable protocol.

Method: The paper presents a scalable dissipative QEC protocol for discrete-variable codes. It introduces a trickle-down mechanism that sequentially reduces the weight of errors. The protocol exploits redundancy in the Knill-Laflamme conditions to design correction operators that act on multiple error subspaces simultaneously, reducing the overhead from exponential to polynomial in terms of the number of required operators. The approach uses repetition codes under biased noise to demonstrate a fourfold improvement in the exponential suppression factor at realistic physical error rates.

Result: The protocol shows significant efficiency gains, particularly demonstrating a fourfold improvement in the exponential suppression factor at realistic physical error rates. This improvement in suppression factor indicates enhanced fault-tolerant operation and scalability.

Conclusion: The work connects dissipative QEC for discrete-variable codes with demonstrated bosonic QEC protocols and opens up new avenues for traditional measurement-feedback QEC and fault-tolerant quantum operations. The scalable protocol suggests promising progress towards practical quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Dissipative quantum error correction (QEC) autonomously protects quantum
information using engineered dissipation and offers a promising alternative to
error correction via measurement and feedback. However, scalability remains a
challenge, as correcting high-weight errors typically requires increasing
dissipation rates and exponentially many correction operators. Here, we present
a scalable dissipative QEC protocol for discrete-variable codes, correcting
multi-qubit errors via a trickle-down mechanism that sequentially reduces
errors weight. Our construction exploits redundancy in the Knill-Laflamme
conditions to design correction operators that act on multiple error subspaces
simultaneously, thereby reducing the overhead from exponential to polynomial in
the number of required operators. We illustrate our approach with repetition
codes under biased noise, showing a fourfold improvement in the exponential
suppression factor at realistic physical error rates. Our approach connects
autonomous QEC for discrete-variable codes with demonstrated dissipative
protocols for bosonic codes and opens up new avenues for traditional
measurement-feedback QEC and fault-tolerant quantum operations.

Abstract: Current quantum annealing experiments often suffer from restrictions in
connectivity in the sense that only certain qubits can be coupled to each
other. The most common strategy to overcome connectivity restrictions so far is
by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit with higher
connectivity, which is achieved by adding terms to the Hamiltonian.
Practically, this strategy is implemented by finding a so-called minor
embedding, which is in itself an NP-hard problem. In this work, we present an
iterative algorithm that does not need additional qubits but instead
efficiently uses the available connectivity for different parts of the problem
graph in every step. We present a weak monotonicity proof and benchmark our
algorithm against the default minor-embedding algorithm on the D-Wave quantum
annealer and multiple simple local search variants. While most of the
experiments to compare the different iterative methods are performed with
simulated annealing solvers, we also confirm the practicality of our method
with experiments on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer.

Abstract: We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO)
representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes
as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements,
and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity
with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out
sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group
algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical
conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in
typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide
an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the
experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning
entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum
processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum
computation and simulation experiments.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of quantum systems is essential for the development
of quantum technologies, particularly in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum

characterization often require extensive measurements and scale poorly with
system size, machine learning approaches offer promising alternatives. In this
work, we extend the inverse physics-informed neural network (referred to as
PINNverse) framework to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad master
equations. By incorporating both coherent and dissipative dynamics into the
neural network training, our method enables simultaneous identification of
Hamiltonian parameters and decay rates from noisy experimental data. We
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach through numerical
simulations of two-qubit open systems. Our results show that PINNverse provides
a scalable and noise-resilient framework for quantum system identification,
with potential applications in quantum control and error mitigation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper describes a method for free-fall experiments with a charge-neutral nanoparticle using an optical tweezer. They achieve up to 0.25 ms free-fall durations and observe significant increases in position uncertainty, with the current limitations coming from cooling. They plan to improve by using linear feedback and reducing background pressure for future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome significant limitations in previous free-fall experiments by focusing on achieving longer durations and better precision through advanced control methods and technology.

Method: The authors use an optical tweezer to manipulate a charge-neutral nanoparticle. They enable free-fall by rapidly switching the tweezer on and off and vertically moving it, allowing the particle to fall and then be recaptured. The particle’s neutrality prevents photon recoil heating. They measure position uncertainties and identify the cooling step as the main source of limitations. Linear feedback techniques and reduced background pressure are planned for future improvements.

Result: They successfully observe free-fall experiments with increased durations and significant position uncertainty. The findings are notable but suggest room for improvement by reducing cooling-related limitations.

Conclusion: The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of long-duration free-falls but indicate a need for enhanced cooling methods to achieve the ultimate goal of precise large-scale delocalization of levitated objects, opening new avenues in quantum systems and sensing.

Abstract: We perform free-fall experiments with a charge-neutral, optically levitated
nanoparticle. This is achieved using an optical tweezer that can be rapidly
toggled on and off and vertically displaced, enabling the particle to be
released and recaptured after each free fall. The particle is insensitive to
electric fields due to its charge neutrality and, during free evolution, is not
subject to photon recoil heating. We achieve free-fall durations of up to 0.25
ms and observe a nearly two hundred-fold increase in the particle's position
uncertainty at recapture. The current limit on the free-fall time arises from
the performance of the initial cooling step. By implementing linear feedback
techniques and reducing the background pressure, we expect to perform
millisecond-scale free-fall experiments in ultra-high vacuum, opening new
opportunities for generating large delocalizations of levitated objects.

Abstract: Efficient quantum arithmetic operations are essential building blocks for
complex quantum algorithms, yet few theoretical designs have been implemented
in practical quantum programming frameworks. This paper presents the first
complete implementation of the T-count optimized non-restoring quantum square
root algorithm using the Qrisp quantum programming framework. The algorithm,
originally proposed by Thapliyal et al., offers better resource efficiency
compared to alternative methods, achieving reduced T-count and qubit
requirements while avoiding garbage output. Our implementation validates the
theoretical resource estimates, confirming a T-count of 14n-14 and T-depth of
5n+3 for n-bit inputs. The modular design approach enabled by Qrisp allows
construction from reusable components including reversible adders, subtractors,
and conditional logic blocks built from fundamental quantum gates. The
three-stage algorithm - comprising initial subtraction, iterative conditional
addition/subtraction, and remainder restoration is successfully translated from
algorithmic description to executable quantum code. Experimental validation
across multiple test cases confirms correctness, with the circuit producing
accurate integer square roots and remainders. This work demonstrates the
practical realizability of resource-optimized quantum arithmetic algorithms and
establishes a foundation for implementing different arithmetic operations in
modern quantum programming frameworks.

Abstract: Preserving entanglement in the presence of decoherence remains a major
challenge for quantum technologies. Recent proposals [M.A. Selim et al.,
Science 387, 1424 (2025)] have employed photonic filters based on
anti-parity-time symmetry to recover certain entangled states, but these
approaches require intricate, symmetry-constrained waveguide architectures and
precise bath engineering. In this work, we show that such strict non-Hermitian
symmetry constraints are not necessary for entanglement filtering. Instead, we
identify post-selection and the emergence of dark states -- arising naturally
through destructive interference in simple photonic settings -- as the
essential mechanisms. By avoiding the need for special bath engineering or
non-Hermitian symmetries, our approach significantly simplifies the design and
architecture, enhances universality, and extends applicability beyond
previously studied dimer configurations. We demonstrate this concept using
minimal waveguide network designs, offering a broadly accessible route to
robust entanglement filtering.

Abstract: We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum
Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In
order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid
scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via
quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of
magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to
compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded
into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to
critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a
function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the
partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its
low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence
on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from
entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.

### [69] [Current-based metrology with two-terminal mesoscopic conductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12907)
*Shishir Khandelwal,Gabriel T. Landi,Géraldine Haack,Mark T. Mitchison*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new approach for quantum parameter estimation using stochastic currents in mesoscopic systems, particularly in non-Markovian and nonequilibrium scenarios. By using Landauer-Büttiker formalism, they find that a boxcar transmission function provides optimal precision across different regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve parameter estimation in quantum systems, especially in scenarios where traditional quantum Fisher information methods are insufficient. The paper targets non-Markovian and complex thermal environments, which are challenging but common in many experimental setups.

Method: Landauer-Büttiker formalism is used as the foundation for modeling the system, and the approach involves analytical derivations and optimality analysis of the current-based metrology setup.

Result: Analytical results show that the boxcar transmission function maximizes precision in current-based metrology, applying to both linear-response and zero-temperature scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides a deeper understanding of the limitations and potential of current-based metrology, highlighting the boxcar function as optimal beyond traditional Markovian approaches in mesoscopic systems.

Abstract: The traditional approach to quantum parameter estimation focuses on the
quantum state, deriving fundamental bounds on precision through the quantum
Fisher information. In most experimental settings, however, performing
arbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems,
an alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic
currents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present
understanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master
equations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal
mesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation
precision within the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach
allows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore,
we obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and
zero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we
consider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for
current-based metrology in all parameter regimes.

Abstract: There has been a wave of recent interest in detecting the quantum nature of
gravity with table-top experiments that witness gravitationally mediated
entanglement. Central to these proposals is the assumption that any mediator
capable of generating entanglement must itself be nonclassical. However,
previous arguments for this have modelled classical mediators as finite,
discrete systems such as bits, which excludes physically relevant continuous
and infinite-dimensional systems such as those of classical mechanics and field
theory. In this work, we close this gap by modelling classical systems as
commutative unital C*-algebras, arguably encompassing all potentially
physically relevant classical systems. We show that these systems cannot
mediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are
themselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras
(as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product.
This result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced
entanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently
non-classical features.

Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance
in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum
($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and
sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic
materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions,
superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we
present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC),
exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin
films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the
superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we
demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most
widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated
nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high
impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of
magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area
reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and
high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance
superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many
opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and
the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator
arrays.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子纠缠在小量子系统中的分布提供了全面而简洁的分析框架，特别适用于极值问题的求解。但是对于更大的量子系统，新的方法仍需开发，以更好地理解量子纠缠的复杂性。

Abstract: Multipartite quantum systems are subject to monogamy relations that impose
fundamental constraints on the distribution of quantum correlations between
subsystems. These constraints can be studied quantitatively through sector
lengths, defined as the average value of $m$-body correlations, which have
applications in quantum information theory and coding theory. In this work, we
derive a set of monogamy inequalities that complement the shadow inequalities,
enabling a complete characterization of the numerical range of sector lengths
for systems with $N\leq 5$ qubits in a pure state. This range forms a convex
polytope, facilitating the efficient extremization of key physical quantities,
such as the linear entropy of entanglement and the quantum shadow enumerators,
by a simple evaluation at the polytope vertices. For larger systems ($N\geq
6$), we highlight a significant increase in complexity that neither our
inequalities nor the shadow inequalities can fully capture.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of
inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact
diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic
response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic
examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays
yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to
linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling
among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish
quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum
circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum
sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter,
by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we
demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This
dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves
both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of
signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing

Abstract: In this manuscript, we present another new thermal scalar and vector gauge
potentials implemented by the quantum Boltzmann equation, which originates from
the interaction of conduction electrons and phonons. To accomplish this task,
we derive a temperature dependent four dimensional damping force by the Taylor
series expansion on the self energy of the QBE, which can be related to the
thermal scalar and vector gauge potentials, especially the fourth component of
the damping force, which is just a power corresponding to a new scalar
potential. Based on the local equilibrium assumption, we solve the QBE order by
order using the Fourier transformation method. The temperature dependent
damping force and other physical observables are exhibited in the figures, the
higher of the temperature, the bigger of the damping force.

Abstract: Improving quantum algorithms run-time performance involves several strategies
such as reducing the quantum gate counts, decreasing the number of
measurements, advancement in QPU technology for faster gate operations, or
optimizing the classical processing. This work focuses on the latter,
specifically reducing classical processing and compilation time via
hardware-assisted parameterized circuit execution (PCE) for computing dynamical
properties of quantum systems. PCE was previously validated for QCVV protocols,
which leverages structural circuit equivalencies. We demonstrate the
applicability of this approach to computing dynamical properties of quantum
many-body systems using structurally equivalent time evolution circuits,
specifically calculating correlation functions of spin models using
constant-depth circuits generated via Cartan decomposition. Implementing this
for spin-spin correlation functions in Transverse field XY (up to 6-sites) and
Heisenberg spin models (up to 3-sites), we observed a run-time reduction of up
to 50\% compared to standard compilation methods. This highlights the
adaptability of time-evolution circuit with hardware-assisted PCE to
potentially mitigate the classical bottlenecks in near-term quantum algorithms.

TL;DR: This paper explores using ensemble machine learning to estimate quantum entanglement, showing that ensembles outperform individual models in predicting entanglement measures like negativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting and quantifying quantum entanglement in complex systems, which is difficult with traditional methods. Using machine learning, specifically an ensemble of models including NN, XGBoost, and Extra Trees, the study aims to find a reliable method to estimate entanglement measures.

Method: An ensemble regressor combining three machine learning models was trained on datasets of pure and mixed Werner states for various spin dimensions. The model with a stacking meta-learner showed superior performance compared to individual models.

Result: The ensemble model achieved high accuracy in predicting negativity across different dimensions and state types, with better consistency and lower deviation from true values than individual strong learners like NN.

Conclusion: The study concludes that ensemble machine learning is effective for estimating entanglement in high-dimensional quantum systems, overcoming computational limitations and providing a reliable tool for characterization.

Abstract: Reliable detection and quantification of quantum entanglement, particularly
in high-spin or many-body systems, present significant computational challenges
for traditional methods. This study examines the effectiveness of ensemble
machine learning models as a reliable and scalable approach for estimating
entanglement, measured by negativity, in quantum systems. We construct an
ensemble regressor integrating Neural Networks (NNs), XGBoost (XGB), and Extra
Trees (ET), trained on datasets of pure states and mixed Werner states for
various spin dimensions. The ensemble model with stacking meta-learner
demonstrates robust performance by CatBoost (CB), accurately predicting
negativity across different dimensionalities and state types. Crucially, visual
analysis of prediction scatter plots reveals that the ensemble model exhibits
superior predictive consistency and lower deviation from true entanglement
values compared to individual strong learners like NNs, even when aggregate
metrics are comparable. This enhanced reliability, attributed to error
cancellation and variance reduction inherent in ensembling, underscores the
potential of this approach to bypass computational bottlenecks and provide a
trustworthy tool for characterizing entanglement in high-dimensional quantum
physics. An empirical formula for estimating data requirements based on system
dimensionality and desired accuracy is also derived.

Abstract: Noise is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. It arises randomly in
space. Inspired by spatial non-uniformity of the noise, we investigate the
effects of spatial modulation on purification phase transitions in a hybrid
random Clifford circuit. As an efficient observable for extracting quantum
entanglement in mixed states, we employ many-body negativity. The behavior of
the many-body negativity well characterizes the presence of the purification
phase transitions and its criticality. We find the effect of spatial
non-uniformity in measurement probability on purification phase transition. The
criticality of the purification phase transition changes from that of uniform
probability, which is elucidated from the argument of the Harris criterion. The
critical correlation length exponent $\nu$ changes from $\nu < 2$ for uniform
probability to $\nu > 2$ for spatially modulated probability. We further
investigate a setting where two-site random Clifford gate becomes spatially
(quasi-)modulated. We find that the modulation induces a phase transition,
leading to a different pure phase where a short-range quantum entanglement
remains.

Abstract: Four-component Schr\"odinger cat states, superpositions of four coherent
states symmetrically arranged in phase space, offer rich nonclassical features
and enhanced resilience to decoherence, making them promising resources for
quantum information science. We propose a Floquet-engineered scheme to
deterministically generate four-component Schr\"odinger cat states in a hybrid
quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, a microwave cavity, and
a magnon mode. By applying periodic transverse drives to the qubits, we derive
an effective Hamiltonian that conditionally displaces the magnon mode depending
on the joint qubit state. Conditional measurements in the $\sigma_x$ basis
project the magnon mode into nonclassical four-component cat states with high
fidelity. The Wigner functions in the original frame verified the
non-classicality of the four-component Schr\"odinger cat states. Results of
systematically analyzing the impacts of qubit decoherence, magnon loss, and
cavity dissipation demonstrate the robustness to the dissipation. The results
show that this scheme can realize the generation of multi-component quantum
superposition states in a scalable solid-state platform, providing a new
approach for hybrid quantum information processing based on nonclassical magnon

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in quantum communication require reliable models for atmospheric effects. Accurate transmittance modeling is crucial for channel characterization and protocol optimization.

Method: The circular-beam approximation is introduced as a simplified alternative to the elliptic-beam model, using well-known circular Gaussian beam theory and higher-order moments for parameter estimation.

Result: The new method reduces computational complexity while maintaining accuracy within acceptable limits and extends the applicability of the model.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical solution for atmospheric channel modeling in quantum communication, simplifying analysis without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The evolution of quantum states of light in free-space channels is strongly
influenced by atmospheric turbulence, posing a significant challenge for
quantum communication. The transmittance in such channels randomly fluctuates.
This effect is commonly described by the probability distribution of
transmittance (PDT). The elliptic-beam approximation provides an analytical
model for the PDT, showing good agreement with experimental and simulation data
within a specific range of channel parameters. In this work, we introduce the
circular-beam approximation -- a simplified alternative that offers
satisfactory accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity. We
also present an alternative technique for evaluating the parameters of this
model based on the first two moments of transmittance. This approach notably
extends the applicability range of our PDT model, offering a practical tool for
characterizing atmospheric channels in quantum applications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to reduce the computational complexity of optimal quantum layout synthesis by focusing on relevant subarchitectures with a fixed number of ancilla qubits, thus boosting performance while maintaining optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, and optimizing quantum circuit layouts is crucial due to the limited scalability and noise issues of current quantum platforms. This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing optimal layouts by minimizing circuit size and depth, which directly impacts noise reduction and practicality.

Method: The authors propose a technique that enumerates relevant subarchitectures by fixing a certain number of ancilla qubits. This reduces the number of subgraph isomorphism checks and considered subarchitectures, thereby improving the efficiency of optimal quantum layout synthesis without compromising on the optimality of the solution.

Result: The method was evaluated on various benchmarks and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art tools, both when incorporating subarchitectures and without. This suggests that the approach effectively optimizes the use of available quantum resources.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances the efficiency of optimal quantum layout synthesis by focusing on critical subarchitectures, enabling better resource utilization on existing quantum hardware despite scalability limitations and noise issues.

Abstract: Quantum Layout Synthesis (QLS) maps a logical quantum circuit to a physical
quantum platform. Optimal QLS minimizes circuit size and depth, which is
essential to reduce the noise on current quantum platforms. Optimal QLS is an
NP-hard problem, so in practice, one maps a quantum circuit to a subset of the
complete quantum platform. However, to guarantee optimality, one still has to
consider exponentially many subarchitectures.
  We introduce an effective method to enumerate relevant subarchitectures. This
reduces the number of considered subarchitectures, as well as the number of
expensive subgraph isomorphism checks, thus boosting Optimal QLS with
subarchitectures. To do so, we assume a fixed number of ancilla qubits that can
be used in the mapping. We guarantee optimality of the quantum layout, for the
selected ancilla bound.
  We evaluate our technique on a number of benchmarks and compare it with
state-of-the-art Optimal QLS tools with and without using subarchitectures.

Abstract: We present a modular interpreter for PyTheus-optimized quantum networks that
automatically analyzes and visualizes complex quantum architectures discovered
through automated optimization. The interpreter addresses the critical
challenge of understanding machine-designed quantum networks by providing
robust algorithms for functional role identification, graph-theoretical

PyTheus-generated networks. Our interpreter accepts both file-based and
in-memory network representations, automatically identifies sources, detectors,
beam splitters, and ancillas through priority-based classification, and
generates coordinated native graph plots and optical table representations. We
demonstrate the interpreter's capabilities through two complementary
approaches: (1) analysis of a newly developed five-node quantum key
distribution network that reveals distributed source architecture and dual-role
node functionality, and (2) comprehensive validation using existing PyTheus
examples including W4 state generation, heralded Bell state preparation, and
GHZ state networks. The interpreter successfully handles complex connectivity
patterns across diverse quantum network architectures within the tested
classes, avoids visualization artifacts, and provides validation mechanisms for
architectural consistency. Our primary contribution is the development of
robust modular interpretation algorithms that can analyze the major classes of
PyTheus-generated quantum networks, enabling better understanding of automated

TL;DR: This paper extends the classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation to quantum electrodynamic and quantum optical systems by treating the trap location quantum mechanically. They find quantum corrections and propose experiments using optomechanical setups to observe these corrections, opening new avenues in quantum simulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are expanding a well-known transformation in quantum mechanics to include quantum effects, which is particularly relevant for advanced fields like attoscience and ultrafast physics, providing new tools for quantum simulations.

Method: The method involves taking the classical transformation and applying quantum corrections to the trap location, likely using perturbative techniques or considering quantized forces. They also propose optomechanical setups to perform experiments.

Result: The key result is the derivation of quantum corrections to the transformation and the proposal of experiments demonstrating these effects, which could lead to new quantum simulation techniques in QED and quantum optics.

Conclusion: The paper introduces novel quantum simulation methods leveraging the extended transformation, suggesting potential breakthroughs in understanding complex quantum systems through ultracold atom and ion systems.

Abstract: The classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation connects, via a series of
unitary transformations, the dynamics of a quantum particle of mass $m$ located
in a trap at position $\alpha(t)$, with the dynamics of a charge $e$ moving in
an electric field $e{\cal{E}}(t)=-m\ddot{\alpha}(t)$ within the dipole
approximation. In this paper, we extend the classical Kramers-Henneberger
transformation to the quantum electrodynamic and quantum optical realm, by
explicitly treating the trap location quantum mechanically, thus taking into
account the quantum fluctuations of the time-dependent displacement force.
Compared to the classical case, we show that quantum electrodynamic corrections
appear, and we propose an optomechanical realization for the quantized position
of the trap to show that such corrections can manifest in state-of-the-art
experiments. These results open the path to novel quantum simulation of quantum
electrodynamics and quantum optics of attoscience and ultrafast physics by

### [83] [Geometry of quantum states and chaos-integrability transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13067)
*Ankit Gill,Keun-Young Kim,Kunal Pal,Kuntal Pal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between quantum state geometry, fidelity susceptibility, and quantum metric tensor in random matrix ensembles undergoing an integrability to chaos transition. It finds that both measures depend on energy level correlations, and that geodesic distances remain finite outside the integrable phase. The fidelity characteristics are consistent across different β-ensembles, indicating a universal aspect of phase transitions in quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how quantum states change when moving through different phases of a system, specifically focusing on transitions from integrable to chaotic states. It uses tools like fidelity susceptibility and quantum metric tensor to quantify these changes, aiming to understand the geometry of parameter spaces and phase transitions in quantum mechanics.

Method: The paper employs techniques from random matrix theory, calculating correlation functions of Gaussian ensembles, deriving fidelity susceptibility and quantum metric tensor, and solving geodesic equations to analyze parameter space geometry.

Result: Both fidelity susceptibility and quantum metric tensor are influenced by energy level spacing distributions and correlations, revealing a consistent approach to quantifying phase transitions. Geodesic distances remain finite outside the integrable phase, indicating the presence of a distinct non-integrable region. Fidelity measures across different β-ensembles share universal features, suggesting common mechanisms for phase transitions.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive analysis of quantum state geometry in integrable to chaotic transitions, demonstrating consistent fidelity measurability and the role of parameter distances in phase transitions. It highlights the applicability of these tools across multiple random matrix ensembles, contributing to our understanding of quantum phase transitions through geometric lens.

Abstract: We consider the geometry of quantum states associated with classes of random
matrix Hamiltonians, in particular ensembles that show integrability to chaotic
transition in terms of the nearest neighbour energy level spacing distribution.
In the case that the total Hamiltonian contains a single parameter, the
distance between two states is captured by the fidelity susceptibility,
whereas, when the total Hamiltonian contains multiple parameters, this distance
is given by the quantum metric tensor. Since the fieldity susceptibility is
closely related to the two-point correlation function, we first calculate the
relevant correlation functions of a random matrix belonging to the Gaussian
unitary ensemble in terms of the spectral form factor of the total Hamiltonian,
show how to obtain the fidelity susceptibility from this correlation function,
and explain the role played by energy level correlation. Next, by performing
suitable coordinate transformations, we solve the geodesic equations
corresponding to the quantum metric tensor obtained from an
integrability-breaking random matrix Hamiltonian and obtain the geodesic
distance between two points on the parameter manifold to show that any point
far away from the integrable phase can be reached by a finite value of this
distance. Finally, we obtain and discuss different properties of the fidelity
susceptibility associated with Hamiltonians belonging to another random matrix
ensemble which shows integrability to chaos transition, namely the Gaussian
$\beta$-ensembles with general values of the Dyson index $\beta$, and show that
the fidelity susceptibility shares generic features with the first class of
Hamiltonians.

*Mario Gonzalez,Karin Sim,R. Chitra*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and proposes a method to simulate it using Hermitian systems. The authors used digital quantum simulators to provide evidence for their approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of implementing non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in physical systems, which has been a theoretical and experimental gap.

Method: They propose operator dilation schemes and use digital quantum simulators for proof of concept.

Result: They successfully demonstrate the dynamical metric and validate their method experimentally.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new method for simulating non-Hermitian systems, opening new possibilities in quantum computing and simulations.

Abstract: Standard quantum mechanics predicts the non-conservation of state norms and
probability when the fundamental requirement of the Hermiticity of the
Hamiltonian is relaxed. Biorthogonal quantum mechanics, or the more general
metric formalism, provides a rigorous formulation of non-Hermitian quantum
mechanics wherein norms and probabilities are conserved. The key feature is
that the Hilbert space is endowed with a non-trivial dynamical metric. Beyond
theoretical considerations, the physical implementation of the metric formalism
remains unaddressed. In this work, we propose novel operator dilation schemes,
which show that the self-consistent non-Hermitian quantum mechanics can be
accessed in physical platforms via an embedding in closed Hermitian systems.
Using digital quantum simulators, we present a proof of principle and the first
experimental evidence for the dynamical metric engendered by non-Hermiticity in
a qubit. Our work ushers in a new paradigm in the quantum simulation of
non-Hermitian systems.

TL;DR: The study proposes a new type of mechanical qubit using squeezed Fock states in a nonlinear oscillator to improve qubit coherence and sensitivity, showing promising results in enhanced sensing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanical qubits have potential for enhanced coherence and sensing but face limitations due to weak nonlinearities and small anharmonicity. This study aims to overcome these limitations through innovative use of squeezed Fock states.

Method: The study uses a parametrically driven nonlinear mechanical oscillator with two-phonon driving. Squeezed Fock states are shown to become eigenstates of this system, enabling the creation of a mechanical squeezed-Fock qubit.

Result: The proposed qubit achieves significantly enhanced sensitivity for quantum sensing, at least an order of magnitude better than traditional qubits.

Conclusion: The research introduces a promising mechanical qubit platform with improved characteristics for quantum information processing and sensing, opening new avenues for exploration in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Mechanical qubits offer unique advantages over other qubit platforms,
primarily in terms of coherence time and possibilities for enhanced sensing
applications, but their potential is constrained by the inherently weak
nonlinearities and small anharmonicity of nanomechanical resonators. We propose
to overcome this shortcoming by using squeezed Fock states of phonons in a
parametrically driven nonlinear mechanical oscillator. We find that, under
two-phonon driving, squeezed Fock states become eigenstates of a Kerr-nonlinear
mechanical oscillator, featuring an energy spectrum with exponentially enhanced
and tunable anharmonicity, such that the transitions to higher energy states
are exponentially suppressed. This enables us to encode the mechanical qubit
within the ground and first excited squeezed Fock states of the driven
mechanical oscillator. This kind of mechanical qubit is termed mechanical
squeezed-Fock qubit. We also show that our mechanical qubit can serve as a
quantum sensor for weak forces, with its resulting sensitivity increased by at
least one order of magnitude over that of traditional mechanical qubits. The
proposed mechanical squeezed-Fock qubit provides a powerful quantum phonon
platform for quantum sensing and information processing.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the quantum-to-classical transition (QCT) in finite-dimensional systems. It introduces an operational framework using generalized coherent state measurements and depolarizing channels to bridge the transition. The study reveals how quantum measurements reduce negative quasi-probabilities, suggesting a path towards classical behavior. Additionally, the paper provides quantum circuit implementations, making the approach practical for current technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanism of quantum-to-classical transition is pivotal for quantum computing and information processing. This paper aims to uncover the underlying principles by introducing a novel measurement framework, which could lead to advancements in quantum technologies.

Method: The authors employed an operational framework involving discrete generalized coherent state positive-operator-valued measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing channels to bridge the quantum-to-classical transition. They analyzed how dimensionality and decoherence rate influence the transition and demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach using single-shot generalized measurements, showing reduction in negative quasi-probabilities. Quantum circuit implementations were also designed to be achievable with current technology.

Result: The paper shows that single-shot generalized measurements can significantly reduce negative quasi-probabilities in phase space for finite-dimensional systems. This reduction facilitates the transition towards classical behavior. Additionally, the authors propose practical quantum circuit implementations that leverage current quantum technologies.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition in finite-dimensional systems by integrating generalized measurements with depolarizing channels. It offers a clear path for achieving a transition with current quantum technologies, emphasizing the role of dimensionality and decoherence rates in the process.

Abstract: Quantum-to-classical transition for finite-dimensional systems is widely
considered to occur continuously, yet the mechanism underlying the intermediate
stage remains unclear. In this work, we address this challenge by adopting an
operational framework to bridge discrete generalized coherent state
positive-operator-valued measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing
channels. Our unified treatment reveals how dimensionality and decoherence rate
collectively govern the quantum-to-classical transition. Notably, we
demonstrate that a single-shot generalized measurement can eliminate most
negative quasi-probabilities in phase space for finite-dimensional systems.
Furthermore, we propose quantum circuit implementations achievable with current
state-of-the-art quantum technologies.

Abstract: Measuring global quantum properties -- such as the fidelity to complex
multipartite states -- is both an essential and experimentally challenging
task. Classical shadow estimation offers favorable sample complexity, but
typically relies on many-qubit circuits that are difficult to realize on
current platforms. We propose the robust phase shadow scheme, a measurement
framework based on random circuits with controlled-Z as the unique entangling
gate type, tailored to architectures such as trapped ions and neutral atoms.
Leveraging tensor diagrammatic reasoning, we rigorously analyze the induced
circuit ensemble and show that phase shadows match the performance of full
Clifford-based ones. Importantly, our approach supports a noise-robust
extension via purely classical post-processing, enabling reliable estimation
under realistic, gate-dependent noise where existing techniques often fail.
Additionally, by exploiting structural properties of random stabilizer states,
we design an efficient post-processing algorithm that resolves a key
computational bottleneck in previous shadow protocols. Our results enhance the
practicality of shadow-based techniques, providing a robust and scalable route
for estimating global properties in noisy quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum optics and atomic systems are prominent platforms for exploiting
quantum-enhanced precision in parameter estimation. However, not only are
quantum optical and atomic systems often treated separately, but even within
quantum optics, identifying optimal probes (quantum states) and evolutions
(parameter-dependent dynamics) typically relies on case-by-case analyses. Mode,
and sometimes only particle entanglement, can yield quantum enhancement of
precision in continuous- and discrete-variable regimes, yet a clear connection
between these regimes remains elusive. In this work, we present a unified
framework for quantum metrology that encompasses all known precision-enhancing
regimes using bosonic resources. We introduce a superselection rule compliant
representation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly incorporates the
phase reference, enforcing total particle number conservation. This approach
provides a description of the electromagnetic field which is formally
equivalent to the one employed in atomic systems, and we show how it
encompasses both the discrete and the continuous limits of quantum optics.
Within this framework, we consistently recover established results while
offering a coherent physical interpretation of the quantum resources
responsible for precision enhancement. Moreover, we develop general strategies
to optimize precision using arbitrary multimode entangled probe states.
Finally, our formalism readily accommodates noise, measurement strategies and
non-unitary evolutions, extending its applicability to realistic experimental
scenarios.

TL;DR:  paper discusses perfect and quasi-perfect state transfer in linear spin chains with non-uniform on-site energies; addresses coupling uniformity and its impact on quantum information processing. Key findings remain to be seen but suggest it's an active area linking quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.

Motivation: the desire to maintain coupling uniformity in spin chains despite the physical challenges posed by non-uniform on-site energies.

Method: uses mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to examine state transfer fidelity as a function of chain length and statistical variations in couplings and on-site energies.

Result: demonstrates that both on-site energy variations and coupling fluctuations may affect the fidelity of state transfer. Longer chains may lead to decreased transfer fidelity due to cumulative effects of statistical variations. However, specific scenarios where either uniformity or controlled disorder can optimize transfer fidelity are highlighted.

Conclusion:  recherchent une approche Og benefitne de la uniformité des couplages pour améliorer la fiabilité de transfert de l'état quantique dans des architectures de transmission d'information quantique distribuée. Les résultats suggèrent que la gestion de l'impureté des couplages est cruciale pour maintenir une fiabilité browsable. Plus importantly, future studies should focus on finding instances where controlled disorder can lead to improved state transfer fidelity.

Abstract: High fidelity state transfer is an important ingredient of distributed
quantum information processing. We present and analyse results on perfect and
quasi-perfect state transfer with linear spin chains incorporating non-uniform
on-site energies. The motivation is maintenance of coupling uniformity, which
could be beneficial for some physical implementations. We relate this coupling
uniformity to a particle in a discrete potential analogue. Our analysis further
considers the statistical variation in couplings and on-site energies, as a
function of increasing chain site number N.

Conclusion: 实验方法有效，为优化量子传感器提供了新方法。

Abstract: Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one
hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been
widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron
spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by
shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen
concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum
devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or
electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen
content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV
center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low
concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure
the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per
billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique.
Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed
to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created
during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation
dose.

Abstract: A quantum memory is an essential element for quantum computation, quantum
network and quantum metrology. Previously, a single-qubit quantum memory with a
coherence time of about an hour has been realized in a dual-species setup where
a coolant ion provides sympathetic cooling for a memory ion of different
species. However, the frequent random position hopping between the ions in the
room-temperature trap limits the technique there only applicable to
single-qubit storage. Here we report a multi-ion quantum memory in a cryogenic
trap based on the dual-type scheme, and demonstrate a coherence time above two
hours for a logical qubit encoded in the decoherence-free subspace, i.e.
two-ion entangled states, after correcting the dominant leakage error. Our
scheme alleviates the necessity of an ultra-stable frequency reference for the
stored qubit, and has a preferable scalability owing to the same mass of the
metastable-state memory ions and the ground-state coolant ion.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algebro-geometric approach using arc spaces to interpret Schur and Macdonald indices for four-dimensional N=2 SCFTs. A conjectured affine scheme X relates the Hilbert series of the arc space of the polynomial ring to the indices of theories without Higgs branches, which correspond to certain nilpotency conditions in operator product expansions. Tested across Argyres-Douglas theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the desire to connect geometric and algebraic structures with the physical properties of conformal field theories, particularly through the Schur and Macdonald indices, which are important in characterizing SCFTs and their dualities.

Method: The method involves constructing an affine scheme X based on the Hilbert series of appropriately-graded arc spaces, relating it to the polynomial ring of the SCFTs. The approach connects singular points through distinct local descriptions, leading to nilpotency conditions in operator product expansions. The framework is tested on generalized Argyres-Douglas theories.

Result: The conjectured relationship between the affine scheme X and the SCFTs holds true across various Argyres-Douglas theories, providing a geometric interpretation of the Schur and Macdonald indices and linking them to nilpotent operator conditions. This strengthens the connection between algebraic geometry and conformal field theories in four dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper successfully integrates algebraic geometry with four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories, offering a new perspective on their Schur and Macdonald indices by interpreting them through arc spaces and nilpotent operator relations. This framework not only deepens the theoretical understanding of SCFTs but also opens new avenues for future research in dualities and geometric interpretations in theoretical physics.

Abstract: We propose an algebro-geometric interpretation of the Schur and Macdonald
indices of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories
(SCFTs). We conjecture that there exists an affine scheme $X$ such that the
Hilbert series of the (appropriately-graded) arc space of its polynomial ring
$J_\infty(\mathbb{C}[X])$ encodes the indices. Distinct local descriptions of a
(singular) point correspond to distinct choices of $X$, giving rise to a family
of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs each without a Higgs branch. These local descriptions
directly translate into nilpotency relations in the operator product
expansions. We test our conjecture across a variety of (generalized)
Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories.

Abstract: We consider correlation functions in symmetric product orbifold CFTs on the
sphere, focusing on the case where all operators are single-cycle twists, and
the covering surface is also a sphere. We directly construct the general class
of covering space maps where there are three twists of arbitrary lengths, along
with any number of twist-2 insertions. These are written as a ratio of sums of
Jacobi polynomials with $\Delta N+1$ coefficients $b_N$. These coefficients
have a scaling symmetry $b_N\rightarrow \lambda b_N$, making them naturally
valued in $\mathbb{CP}^{\Delta N}$. We explore limits where various ramified
points on the cover approach each other, which are understood as crossing
channel specific OPE limits, and find that these limits are defined by
algebraic varieties of $\mathbb{CP}^{\Delta N}$. We compute the expressions
needed to calculate the group element representative correlation functions for
bare twists. Specializing to the cases $\Delta N=1,2$, we find closed form for
these expressions which define four- and five-point functions of bare twists.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of higher Berry connection and curvature in the space
of conformal boundary conditions in (1+1)d conformal field theories (CFT),
related to each other by exactly marginal boundary deformations, forming a
"boundary conformal manifold." Our definition builds upon previous works on
tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS), where the triple inner
product or multi-wavefunction overlap plays the key geometric role. On the one
hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry
phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in
condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric
structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the
usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the
boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space
of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in
string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation
and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions
of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection
between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop
spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 论文分析了Aretakis不稳定性对非膨胀极值磁单级数的影响。他们发现扰动场的增长速率由近地视图中的AdS因子的缩放维数决定，导致极值磁单级数更容易出现这种不稳定性，并且它的影响程度低于极值黑洞。此外，更高数目的模态可能导致更严重的曲率奇点，比极值黑洞更糟。


<details>

Motivation: 研究者希望了解极端磁单级数的不稳定性问题，特别是如何计算和比较与其他极端对象相比的稳定性，这可能为适用不同理论场或不同的维度提供指导。

Method: 他们将问题转化为Freund-Rubin空间上的Kaluza-Klein谱计算，从而确定了不稳定性强度。还计算了静态形变的平滑性，比较了与极端黑洞的不同。

Result: 非膨胀极值磁单级数更容易出现Aretakis不稳定性，尽管没有额外场，它的影响比极值黑洞弱。而更多的模态可能导致更糟糕的曲率奇点。

Conclusion: 该研究表明非膨胀极值磁单级数在某种程度上比极端黑洞更稳定，但过分的模态可能导致更恶劣的几何奇点。这对理解极端物体的稳定性和适用额外场或更高维度的理论可能有帮助。

Abstract: We investigate how the Aretakis instability affects non-dilatonic extremal
black $p$-branes by focusing on their near-horizon geometry. Crucially, the
strength of the instability, \textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives
needed to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is
given by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon
$\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor. This renders the problem of determining the
severity of the Aretakis instability equivalent to computing the Kaluza--Klein
spectrum of fields on Freund--Rubin spaces. We use this to argue that
non-dilatonic extremal black branes suffer from the Aretakis instability even
in the absence of additional fields -- we find that this is weaker than for
extremal black holes. We also argue that the scaling dimensions determine the
smoothness of stationary deformations to the original black brane background --
here, our findings indicate that generically more modes can lead to worse
curvature singularities compared to extremal black holes.

### [99] [$20'$ Five-Point Function of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and Stringy Corrections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12533)
*Joao Vilas Boas*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper calculates the first stringy correction to certain correlation functions in N=4 SYM using bootstrap methods and Mellin amplitudes, achieving a significant portion of the result using factorization and supersymmetry, and only requiring a minor assumption to complete it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to extend the understanding of correlation functions in the supergravity regime by computing stringy corrections, likely to test conjectures about the AdS/CFT correspondence or to advance bootstrap approaches in conformal field theories.

Method: The method involves factorization of Mellin amplitudes and supersymmetric constraints to fix most of the ansatz for the correlation functions; a mild assumption based on the flat-space limit of Mellin amplitudes determines the remaining coefficients.

Result: The paper successfully computes the first stringy correction for five 20' operators and partially for four-point correlators involving stress tensors or R-symmetry currents, using the factorization and constraints to determine the majority of the coefficients and a minimal assumption for the rest.

Conclusion: The results provide new insights into the structure of Mellin amplitudes and advance the bootstrap method for computing correlation functions, particularly in the supergravity regime with stringy corrections included.

Abstract: We setup a bootstrap approach to compute the first stringy correction to the
supergravity regime of the correlation function of five $20'$ operators in
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. We use factorization of Mellin amplitudes and
supersymmetric constraints to fix almost completely our ansatz. The two last
coefficients are fixed by a justified mild assumption based on the flat-space
limit of the Mellin amplitude. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also compute
the first stringy correction to the four-point correlators of three $20'$
operators and either one R-symmetry current or one stress tensor.

### [100] [(Super)$\,$Gravity from Positivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12535)
*Brando Bellazzini,Alex Pomarol,Marcello Romano,Francesco Sciotti*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper suggests that a consistent effective theory for spin-3/2 particles must include gravitons coupling in a near-supersymmetric manner. It explores how gravity emerges from S-matrix conditions, necessitates a (gravi)photon for certain models, and identifies extremal UV models with new supersymmetry-breaking scenarios. The analysis uses tools like dispersion relations and EFT-hedrons to map the boundaries of possible theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge high-energy physics concepts like causality, unitarity, supersymmetry, and the weak gravity conjecture with spin-3/2 particles, exploring the conditions under which such a theory can exist.

Method: Mathematical analysis of scattering amplitudes, dispersion relations, and effective field theories (EFTs). The paper uses positivity bounds and symmetry principles to constrain the possible coupling structures.

Result: The paper shows that non-trivial solutions to the positivity constraints are possible only when gravitons are included, particularly in a supersymmetric way, leading to a consistent effective theory. This includes models with and without global symmetries, applying both weak and strong gravity conjectures.

Conclusion: The study concludes that spin-3/2 particles must be coupled to gravitons in a near-supersymmetric framework for the effective theory to respect unitarity and causality, suggesting that gravity emerges from these fundamental consistency conditions in the theory of massive spin-3/2 particles.

Abstract: We investigate whether the effective theory for isolated, massive, and weakly
interacting spin-$3/2$ particles is compatible with causality and
unitarity-i.e., the positivity of scattering amplitudes. We find no solution to
positivity constraints, except when gravitons are also present and couple in a
(nearly) supersymmetric way. Gravity is thus bootstrapped from $S$-matrix
consistency conditions for the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of
massive spin-$3/2$ states. For two such particles forming a $U(1)$-charged
state, a (gravi)photon gauging the symmetry is also required, with couplings
characteristic of supergravity and consistent with both the no global symmetry
and weak gravity conjectures. We further explore the EFT-hedron associated with
the longitudinal polarizations, the Goldstinos, through novel $t$-$u$ symmetric
dispersion relations. We identify the extremal UV models that lie at the
corners of the allowed parameter space, recovering familiar models of
supersymmetry breaking and uncovering new ones.

Result: 在单个Majorana自旋-3/2费米子情况下，与自旋0和大质量自旋-1玻色子的相互作用不足以构造有效高效理论。引入自旋-2引力子后，四点振幅达到Planck尺度的单元性切割，并与超重力中的结果一致。在两个 Majorana 费米子的情况下，同样需要自旋-2引力子构建高效理论，并依赖不同质量条件达到Planck尺度的单元性。

Conclusion: 被打破的超重力是唯一满足大质量自旋-3/2费米子相互作用的有效高效理论，且其单元性不受粒子质量的影响。文章主要通过壳层方法推导结果，抬出了高效理论与超重力的联系。

Abstract: We employ on-shell methods to construct scattering amplitudes and derive
effective theories involving massive spin-3/2 fermions interacting with spin 0,
1 and 2 bosons. The four-point massive amplitudes are constructed using an
all-line-transverse momentum shift, assuming that in the massless limit,
three-point interactions are smooth and the Ward identity is satisfied. For a
Majorana spin-3/2 fermion with mass $m_{3/2}$, we show that interactions with
only spin 0 and massive spin-1 bosons do not lead to an effective theory valid
up to a cutoff $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ that is independent of particle masses.
Instead, adding an interaction with a spin-2 graviton gives rise to four-point
amplitudes with a Planck scale unitarity cutoff that reproduces well-known
results from $N=1$ supergravity, such as $F$-term breaking with a complex
scalar and $D$-term breaking with an additional massive photon. These bottom-up
results are then extended to two Majorana spin-3/2 fermions where an
interacting effective theory valid up to $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ again requires
the introduction of the spin-2 graviton. Unitarity up to the Planck scale is
then achieved when the two Majorana spin-3/2 fermions have unequal masses, and
necessarily couple to two massive spin-1 states corresponding to the
spontaneous breaking of $N=2$ supergravity to $N=0$. Our results, obtained from
the bottom-up and without any Lagrangian, imply that broken supergravity is the
unique, effective theory involving interactions of massive spin-3/2 fermions
valid up to a cutoff $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ that does not depend on particle
masses.

Motivation: 研究双标量SYK模型在q=0和有限q情况下的谱形状因子及其延迟时间行为，通过弦图和随机矩阵理论的视角进行分析。

Method: 通过计算弦图导出的单迹两点函数之和，对应于随机矩阵理论的局部特征值相关性，并通过分析延迟时间的贡献来识别相关算子，进而推导出有限q情况下的谱形状因子的延迟块状结构。

Result: 得出双标量SYK模型在q=0时的延迟块状结构，并通过有限q情况下的计算验证了delocalize的延迟时间行为。

Conclusion: 双标量SYK模型在q=0时表现出与随机矩阵理论一致的局部特征值相关性，并且在有限q情况下揭示了delocalize的延迟时间区域存在，通过弦图与随机矩阵的结合分析，得出了delocalize的延迟时间结构。

Abstract: We compute the ramp of the spectral form factor analytically from chord
diagrams in double scaled SYK. We map the double-trace correlator to a sum of
single trace two-point functions over a basis of operators. We then reproduce
the local eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory from the chord
diagrams perspective, which is the $q= 0$ limit of double scaled SYK, and
identify the relevant operators that give rise to the late-time ramp. We then
extend the computation to finite $q$, resulting in the late time contribution
to the spectral form factor. We verify that the late time asymptotics of the
finite $q$ computation gives rise to the expected late time ramp. Our
computation also provides the corresponding trumpet partition function and
gluing factor for chords, which form the basis of a chord analog to topological
recursion.

Abstract: In this work, we study the connection between two subjects: the space of
conformal boundary conditions in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and
the space of gapped systems characterized by higher Berry phases. We explore
this connection by analyzing multi-parameter spectral flow in Dirac fermion
BCFTs with continuously parametrized conformal boundary conditions, which are
introduced by coupling a CFT to a family of gapped systems. When the gapped
systems belong to a nontrivial higher Berry class, the associated conformal
boundary conditions induce a flow of the ordinary Berry curvature, resulting in
a Chern number pump in the Fock space of the BCFT. This phenomenon is the BCFT
analog of Berry curvature flow in one-dimensional parametrized gapped systems,
where the flow occurs in real space. Building on this correspondence, we
introduce the notions of higher Berry curvature and higher Berry invariants
within the BCFT framework. Our results provide a new perspective for studying
the topological properties of families of conformal boundary states and gapped
ground states: if a family of gapped states belongs to a nontrivial higher
Berry class, then the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonians exhibit a
multi-parameter spectral flow that carries Berry curvature in the Fock space.

### [104] [Bubbling saddles of the gravitational index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12650)
*Davide Cassani,Alejandro Ruipérez,Enrico Turetta*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores multi-centered solutions in five-dimensional supergravity, focusing on supersymmetric saddles with finite temperature and specific symmetries. They construct rod structures to model fixed loci of isometries, leading to various topologies. The analysis includes configurations with both a black horizon and a bubble outside, calculating their contributions to the gravitational index through on-shell actions and thermodynamic quantities. Two key limits—extremal and horizonless—are discussed, each providing distinct insights into gravitational indices for different configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper appears to be investigating advanced topics in theoretical and mathematical physics, particularly focused on gravitational solutions in higher dimensions and their implications for quantum gravity or related areas like black holes and supersymmetry.

Method: The paper uses a detailed rod structure approach, assuming U(1)^3 symmetry, to construct specific gravitational configurations. It uses stationary supersymmetric solutions and probes their thermodynamic properties to contribute to the gravitational index.

Result: They find that including both a black horizon and a bubble contributes to the gravitational index, particularly in the extremal and horizonless limits. The results aid in the understanding of how such configurations fit into the computation of indices and potentially insights into quantum gravity or black hole entropy.

Conclusion: The study enriches the understanding of multi-center solutions in five-dimensional supergravity, providing new perspectives on the role of black holes and bubbles in the supersymmetric index. The methods and results could have implications for broader studies in quantum gravity and high-energy physics.

Abstract: We consider the five-dimensional supergravity path integral that computes a
supersymmetric index, and uncover a wealth of semiclassical saddles with
bubbling topology. These are complex finite-temperature configurations
asymptotic to $S^1\times\mathbb{R}^4$, solving the supersymmetry equations. We
assume a ${\rm U}(1)^3$ symmetry given by the thermal isometry and two
rotations, and present a general construction based on a rod structure
specifying the fixed loci of the ${\rm U}(1)$ isometries and their
three-dimensional topology. These fixed loci may correspond to multiple
horizons or three-dimensional bubbles, and they may have $S^3$, $S^2\times
S^1$, or lens space topology. Allowing for conical singularities gives
additional topologies involving spindles and branched spheres or lens spaces.
As a particularly significant example, we analyze in detail the configurations
with a horizon and a bubble just outside of it. We determine the possible
saddle-point contribution of these configurations to the gravitational index by
evaluating their on-shell action and the relevant thermodynamic relations. We
also spell out two limits leading to well-definite Lorentzian solutions. The
first is the extremal limit, which gives the BPS black ring and black lens
solutions. The on-shell action and chemical potentials remain well-definite in
this limit and should thus provide the contribution of the black ring and black
lens to the gravitational index. The second is a limit leading to horizonless
bubbling solutions, which have purely imaginary action.

Conclusion: 研究得出，3维纯引力与CFT在边界条件下可以相互对偶，路径积分分别对应不同的CFT态，且可以通过许多方式验证，如将OPE系数与不同理论对应。

Abstract: The path integral of pure 3D gravity with negative cosmological constant is
formulated on a finite region of spacetime $M$, with boundary conditions that
fix geodesic lengths or dihedral angles on $\partial M$. In the dual CFT, this
quasi-local amplitude calculates corrections to the Gaussian ensemble of OPE
coefficients for black hole states. By triangulating $M$ with generalized
tetrahedra, we develop a general method to construct semiclassical geometries
and to calculate the exact gravitational path integral on a fixed hyperbolic
topology. The path integral with fixed-length boundary conditions is a Virasoro
TQFT amplitude-squared, and with fixed-angle boundary conditions it is a
partition function of Conformal Turaev-Viro theory. The two are related by a
modular S-transform. In addition, we show how to translate the calculation of
OPE statistics from Virasoro TQFT to the metric formalism, on general
topologies. These results are derived exactly, and some examples are also
checked semiclassically, including the geometries dual to the Virasoro
6j-symbol and the modular S-matrix. The classical saddlepoint geometries are
finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds ending on pleated Riemann surfaces, which
have vanishing extrinsic curvature except on geodesics where they can bend into
corners. The hyperbolic volumes of these geometries match the predictions of
Conformal Turaev-Viro theory and the dual CFT.

Abstract: We derive the explicit formula for fractional BPS lumps (or fractional
instantons) in the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ nonlinear sigma model on a
two-dimensional torus under various shift-clock twisted boundary conditions.
After regularizing the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ model by an $N$-component
Abelian-Higgs model, those twisted boundary conditions introduce nontrivial
't~Hooft fluxes $p/N$ for the $U(1)$ gauge field, and the topological charge
becomes fractionalized as $k+p/N\in \mathbb{Z}+p/N$. The moduli space is
globally determined as the $\mathbb{C}P^{Nk+p-1}$-fiber bundle on a $2$-torus,
which is a K\"ahler manifold of complex dimension $Nk + p$ as predicted by the
index theorem. We present two different parametrizations of the moduli space:
one of them immediately identifies the small-lump singularity appearing in the
$\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ limit, while the other makes the modular invariance
manifest.
  We also discuss the implications of our finding for the $4$d $SU(N)$
Yang-Mills theory on the $4$-torus with 't~Hooft twists. By tuning the aspect
ratio of the 4-torus, fractional instantons in the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ model
with a non-Fubini-Study metric are obtained through the dimensional reduction
of $4$d Yang-Mills theory, whose moduli space coincides with the one obtained
for the standard $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ model as complex manifolds.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a holographic model to explain the QGP's viscosities beyond the KSS bound, introduces higher-derivative corrections, and demonstrates consistency through multiple methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the QGP's viscosities is crucial for testing the KSS bound and developing realistic models in high-energy physics.

Method: Uses a five-dimensional model with entanglement entropy, Kubo formula, and numerical methods.

Result: Predictions match, confirming the model's efficacy.

Conclusion: Higher-derivative terms are essential for QGP modeling, and holography works well for strongly coupled fluids.

Abstract: The experimentally observed temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities
of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), along with its apparent violation of the
Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound $\eta/s=1/(4\pi)$, necessitate a holographic
description that incorporates higher-derivative corrections. We propose a
five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet model in which a
scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $H(\phi)$ encodes leading curvature corrections.
Although no closed-form black hole solution is available, we employ an
entropy-production analysis at the event horizon to derive exact analytic
formulas for the shear viscosity $\eta$ and bulk viscosity $\zeta$. These
expressions exhibit apparent deviation from the KSS bound and nontrivial
temperature dependence. We then perform an independent computation via the
retarded Green function (Kubo) method, finding perfect agreement for $\eta$ and
isolating a single constant in $\zeta$ that requires numerical determination.
Our dual derivation underscores the pivotal role of higher-derivative terms in
realistic QGP modeling and demonstrates the efficacy of nonanalytic holographic
backgrounds in capturing the dynamics of strongly coupled fluids.

*Yoshio Echigo,Yuji Igarashi,Katsumi Itoh,Jan M. Pawlowski,Yu Takahashi*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper investigates quantum electrodynamics with chiral four-Fermi interactions using the functional renormalization group approach, focusing on gauge symmetry through the quantum master equation. They develop a systematic expansion scheme where flow equation solutions satisfy the quantum master equation, truncating to photon two-point functions to analyze phase structures numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of solving quantum master equations in gauge theories, which is notoriously difficult beyond perturbation theory. They propose a method to ensure that solutions to the flow equations satisfy the quantum master equation, aiming to better understand gauge-invariant dynamics and phase transitions in such theories.

Method: They introduced a systematic expansion scheme where solutions to the flow equations inherently satisfy the quantum master equation. This was applied specifically to the photon two-point functions, which allowed them to numerically explore the phase structure of the system in terms of coupling constants.

Result: Through numerical solutions, they identified distinct phases in their model based on gauge and four-Fermi couplings. This suggests the existence of different phases with varying gauge and interaction strengths, potentially useful for understanding phase transitions in QED with such interactions.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for systematically incorporating gauge symmetry into truncations of the functional renormalization group equations, offering insights into the phase structure of QED with chiral four-Fermi interactions, which is crucial for studying gauge-invariant systems and their critical behavior.

Abstract: We consider quantum electrodynamics with chiral four-Fermi interactions in
the functional renormalization group approach. In gauge theories, the
functional flow equation for the effective action is accompanied by the quantum
master equation that governs the underlying gauge symmetry. Beyond perturbation
theory, fully gauge-consistent solutions are very difficult to obtain. We
devise a systematic expansion scheme in which the solutions of the flow
equation also solve the Quantum Master Equation. In the present work we apply
this construction within the lowest order corrections in the photon two-point
functions. In this truncation we discuss the phase structure in terms of the
gauge and four-Fermi couplings based on a numerical solution of the system.

*Friederike Ihssen,Jan M. Pawlowski*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses physics-informed renormalization group flows for general operators, demonstrating that operator PIRGs can comprehensively access all correlation functions. It suggests that PIRGs improve upon previous approaches by offering more structural insights and computational simplification. The paper uses a vertex expansion in the zero-dimensional ϕ^4-theory to compute generating functions of fundamental fields, including one- to ten-point functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a novel approach to studying quantum field theories using renormalization group flows, aiming to provide a more comprehensive understanding of correlation functions and improve computational methods in this context.

Method: The paper uses operator PIRGs and applies a vertex expansion method in a zero-dimensional ϕ^4-theory model to compute generating functions for various correlation functions.

Result: The study successfully computes the generating functions for one- to ten-point functions, demonstrating the effectiveness of operator PIRGs in providing structural insights and simplifying computations.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising framework for advancing the study of quantum field theories by combining physics-informed methods with renormalization group techniques, particularly in accessible toy models like the zero-dimensional ϕ^4-theory.

Abstract: We discuss physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRGs) for general
operators. We show that operator PIRGs provide a comprehensive access to all
correlation functions of the quantum field theory under investigation. The
operator PIRGs can be seen as a completion of the PIRG-approach, whose
qualitative computational simplification and structural insights are now fully
accessible for general applications. The potential of this setup is assessed
within a simple analytic example of the zero-dimensional $\phi^4$-theory for
which the generating functions of the fundamental field are computed within a
vertex expansion, using the one- to ten-point functions.

### [111] [Comment on "Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap" by S. R. Kousvos and A. Stergiou](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13070)
*Slava Rychkov*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Kousvos and Stergiou criticized our CFT scaling dimension computations, pointing out that our method involved contact terms which were eventually dropped. They questioned if our approach was acceptable. We argue that contact terms are permissible in CFT away from coincident points, and our method operates with a minimal set of quantities, making it preferable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to address a technical issue in conformal field theory computations involving perturbative renormalization group methods. The critique might be focused on methodological choices or the handling of contact terms in scaling dimension calculations. Understanding the validity of these computations is important for advancing the field as accurate results in CFT have wide-ranging implications in theoretical physics, especially in areas like statistical mechanics and high-energy physics.

Method: Our method involves identifying operators whose correlation functions differ by contact terms. We renormalize these contact terms but eventually discard them, adhering to the principles of conformal field theory where such terms are irrelevant away from coincident points. This approach ensures minimal changes to the correlation functions, preserving their essential properties.

Result: We successfully demonstrated that our method is correct and preferable, as it operates with the minimal set of quantities while respecting the principles of conformal field theory and avoiding unnecessary complications introduced by contact terms.

Conclusion: Our critique addresses the concerns raised by Kousvos and Stergiou, reaffirming the validity and effectiveness of our approach. We conclude that handling of contact terms in our method is acceptable within conformal field theory framework, and our approach indeed operates with the minimal set of required quantities, making it a preferable method for such computations.

Abstract: Recent work by Kousvos and Stergiou criticises our work with Zhong Ming Tan
[arXiv:1505.00963]. The issue is CFT scaling dimension computations in
perturbative Renormalization Group. We identified operators whose correlation
functions differ by contact terms. This is allowed because CFT only describes
correlation functions away from coincident points. They instead renormalize the
contact terms, which are eventually dropped. Our way is not only correct, but
preferable as it operates with the minimal set of quantities.

Motivation: 研究自旋自旋相关函数在极端条件下如何应用到形变展开式，可能涉及到场论中的粒子产生和相互作用，有助于理解统计物理中的相变和序参数。

Conclusion: 研究展示了在自由质量费米子点的2维Ising场论中，通过形变扩展方法，成功计算了小r渐进行为，并找到关键尺度函数与Ising CFT中的四点函数的关系。

Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low
rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin
two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the
free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators
are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic
states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can
still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework
and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We
show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling
functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit,
can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the
observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the
other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions
directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show
carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda
\pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value
can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the
scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising
CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the
scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between path integral localisation in string theory on AdS3 and the associated vertex algebras of 3d N=4 theories, particularly focusing on the relationship between the AdS3 boundary and the affine algebra V1(ps...). It also discusses the role of certain operators linked to 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents an in-depth analysis of the analogy between path integral localisation phenomena in string theory and vertex algebras, aiming to provide insights into the dual structure of gauge theories. It builds on previous work by explicit calculation and suggests generalisations for higher-dimensional cases, which is crucial for understanding AdS/CFT correspondence and applications in supersymmetric gauge theories.

Method: The authors employ a combination of theoretical analysis, explicit computations, and heuristic reasoning to explore the connections between path integral localisation, vertex algebras, and the AdS/CFT correspondence. They use mathematical tools such as representation theory and vertex algebra techniques to support their claims and derive the relationship between the boundary and the bulk algebra.

Result: The paper provides evidence for a deep connection between the conformal boundary of AdS3 and the associated variety of the affine algebra V1(ps..), arguing that the path integral localisation relies on this relationship. It explains the origin of operators in this context, particularly those linked to 

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of the geometric and algebraic structures underlying the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence, offering new perspectives on the dualities between string theory on AdS3 and 2D conformal field theories. The authors suggest that similar relationships could hold for higher-dimensional cases, hinting at broader generalisations of the AdS/CFT framework and potential applications in the study of supersymmetric gauge theories and their string theory duals.

Abstract: We comment on certain analogies that have recently emerged between path
integral localisation phenomena in minimal tension string theory on
$\mathrm{AdS}_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and associated varieties of boundary
vertex algebras of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories. We give evidence for the fact
that the path integral localisation relies on an intriguing relation between
the conformal boundary of $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and the associated variety of
$V_1(\mathfrak{psl}(2|2))$, (the complexification of) the affine algebra that
enters the world-sheet description of the string theory. We explain the origin
of certain operators (related to ``secret representations") that have appeared
in this description. Based on the expectation that similar statements will hold
for $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times S^5$, we explicitly write down free field
realisations of $V_1(\mathfrak{psl}(4|4))$ that may hopefully be useful to
study the world-sheet dual of free $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.

Abstract: Krylov complexity has emerged as an important tool in the description of
quantum information and, in particular, quantum chaos. Here we formulate Krylov
complexity $K(t)$ for quantum mechanical systems as a path integral, and argue
that at large times, for classical chaotic systems with at least two minima of
the potential, that have a plateau for $K(t)$, the value of the plateau is
described by quantum mechanical instantons, as is the case for standard
transition amplitudes. We explain and test these ideas in a simple toy model.

### [115] [The Algebraic Structure Underlying Pole-Skipping Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13306)
*Zhenkang Lu,Cheng Ran,Shao-feng Wu*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses pole-skipping phenomena in black hole physics and their application to reconstructing spacetime geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pole-skipping is a recent phenomenon where Green's functions become ambiguous, allowing the reconstruction of spacetime geometries from high-energy physics.

Method: Uses pole-skipping points to solve linear equations for reconstructing black hole geometries.

Result: The method works across various black hole backgrounds, revealing a hidden algebraic structure and enabling reconstruction without solving explicit field equations.

Conclusion: This bridges high-energy physics and quantum gravity, showing pole-skipping as a key tool for spacetime reconstruction.

Abstract: The holographic Green's function becomes ambiguous, taking the indeterminate
form `$0/0$', at an infinite set of special frequencies and momenta known as
``pole-skipping points''. In this work, we propose that these pole-skipping
points can be used to reconstruct both the interior and exterior geometry of a
static, planar-symmetric black hole in the bulk. The entire reconstruction
procedure is fully analytical and only involves solving a system of linear
equations. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various backgrounds,
including the BTZ black hole, its $T\bar{T}$-deformed counterparts, as well as
geometries with Lifshitz scaling and hyperscaling-violation. Within this
framework, other geometric quantities, such as the vacuum Einstein equations,
can also be reinterpreted directly in terms of pole-skipping data. Moreover,
our approach reveals a hidden algebraic structure governing the pole-skipping
points of Klein-Gordon equations of the form $(\nabla^{2} + V(r))\phi(r) = 0$:
only a subset of these points is independent, while the remainder is
constrained by an equal number of homogeneous polynomial identities in the
pole-skipping momenta. These identities are universal, as confirmed by their
validity across a broad class of bulk geometries with varying dimensionality,
boundary asymptotics, and perturbation modes.

### [116] [Challenges for describing unitary evolution in nontrivial geometries: pictures and representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13351)
*Steven B. Giddings,Julie Perkins*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges in defining unitary evolution in general spacetimes above two dimensions, particularly the problem with the Schrödinger picture in these settings and explores possible resolutions involving different quantum state conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in quantum gravity and theoretical physics: ensuring unitary evolution in spacetimes beyond two dimensions, which is crucial for the Schrödinger picture and the dynamics of quantum systems in curved spacetime. It connects various approaches to circumvent this issue by defining physical equivalence classes of states.

Method: The authors analyze the issue by considering the structure of quantum states and the inequivalent representations of canonical commutators. They explore methods for ensuring unitary equivalence, such as using a physical unitary equivalence class and impose conditions like the Hadamard property. They also examine these approaches in concrete models like cosmological and black hole scenarios.

Result: The paper concludes that defining a unitary evolution requires specifying a physical equivalence class that may not follow the Hadamard condition, suggesting alternative frameworks. It proposes that physical states must be selected based on physical criteria, which holds promise for interacting theories with time-dependent spacetimes.

Conclusion: The resolution of this issue is critical for a coherent quantization of spacetime and the development of strategies to describe the wavefunction of the universe. It imposes significant constraints on the canonical quantization approach and highlights the need for a deeper understanding of quantum dynamics in general spacetimes.

Abstract: Description of evolution between spatial slices in a general spacetime
suffers from a significant difficulty: the states on the slices, in a given
basis, are not related by a unitary transformation. This problem, which occurs
in spacetime dimensions above two, is directly related to the infinite number
of inequivalent representations of the canonical commutators, and in particular
will arise for interacting theories in time-dependent spacetimes. We connect
different facets of this issue, and discuss its possible resolution. It is
directly related to discussions of failure of a standard Schr\"odinger picture
of evolution, and of evolution via "many-fingered time." One requires a
condition specifying a physical unitary equivalence class of states; in general
this equivalence class evolves with time, and an important question is how it
is determined. One approach to this in free theories is by imposing a Hadamard
condition on the two point function. We explore a different approach, which
also may be helpful for interacting theories, analyzing the structure of the
state in a local limit, and relate these approaches. We also elucidate the
non-Hadamard behavior of unphysical vacua, and discuss concrete examples of
these approaches involving cosmological and black hole evolution. The issues
are extended in the context of quantum dynamical geometry, and raise important
questions for the proper description of the wavefunction of the universe and
for the role of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.

*Nobuyuki Matsumoto,Katsuta Sakai,Kosei Hatakeyama,Kiwamu Izumi,Daisuke Miki,Satoshi Iso,Akira Matsumura,Kazuhiro Yamamoto*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a space-based interferometer similar to LISA Pathfinder to test gravitationally induced entanglement. They use two small test masses in a shielded environment to detect quantum effects, simulating quantum measurements with environmental factors, and find that GIE can be demonstrated with minor changes to LISA Pathfinder's setup. The result suggests that testing the quantum nature of gravity is feasible through gravitational wave detection methods despite the challenges posed by quantum mechanics and environmental noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The physics community is increasingly interested in quantum gravity, as it seeks to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. Testing gravitational-induced entanglement offers a way to determine whether gravity behaves quantum mechanically, a crucial insight for the theoretical development of quantum gravity models. Additionally, experiments such as LISA Pathfinder have made significant progress in gravitational wave detection, prompting studies that explore quantum phenomena in gravitational systems.

Method: The authors have developed a space-based interferometer design inspired by LISA Pathfinder. Their design includes two small gold-platinum test masses, each weighing a milligram, placed in a shielded environment below 2 K to minimize thermal noise. The setup positions these masses side by side with a millimeter-scale separation. To detect gravitational-induced entanglement, they perform simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. The researchers simulate the quantum measurements while taking into account factors such as gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions to estimate the effect of these environmental factors on the detection of GIE. They conduct simulations to determine the integration time required for successful detection of gravitational-induced entanglement.

Result: The paper concludes that demonstrating gravitational-induced entanglement (GIE) is achievable with only a few adjustments to the existing LISA Pathfinder setup. Their simulations suggest that despite the significant quantum noise and environmental interferences, it is feasible to design an interferometer capable of detecting GIE within a reasonable timeframe and with current technology. This finding brings us closer to experimentally verifying the quantum nature of gravity, which would represent a major milestone in the quest for quantum gravity theories.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising approach for testing the quantum nature of gravity by leveraging interferometry similar to LISA Pathfinder but with optimized components suited for detecting gravitational-induced entanglement. The inclusion of a shielded environment and consideration of various noise sources provide valuable insights into minimizing interference, which could enhance future gravitational wave and quantum gravity experiments.

Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a
milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing
it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a
space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Unlike the
LPF, our design employs two smaller gold-platinum test masses, each weighing
the milligram scale, surrounded by a shield below 2 K, and positioned side by
side with a millimeter scale separation. This configuration enables the
detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and
common-mode motions. We simulate quantum measurements of these modes taking
into account gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions to
estimate the integration time for GIE detection. Our results show that GIE can
be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.

Result: 偶极磁场更易导致混沌，因为其施加的洛伦兹力更大而且具有吸引性质。

Conclusion: 施瓦茨child黑洞外部偶极磁场可能导致粒子运动的非积性行为和混沌。

Abstract: A four-vector potential of an external test electromagnetic field in a
Schwarzschild background is described in terms of a combination of dipole and
quadrupole magnetic fields. This combination is an interior solution of the
source-free Maxwell equations. Such external test magnetic fields cause the
dynamics of charged particles around the black hole to be nonintegrable, and
are mainly responsible for chaotic dynamics of charged particles. In addition
to the external magnetic fields, some circumstances should be required for the
onset of chaos. The effect of the magnetic fields on chaos is shown clearly
through an explicit symplectic integrator and a fast Lyapunov indicator. The
inclusion of the quadrupole magnetic fields easily induces chaos, compared with
that of the dipole magnetic fields. This result is because the Lorentz forces
from the quadrupole magnetic fields are larger than those from the dipole
magnetic fields. In addition, the Lorentz forces act as attractive forces,
which are helpful to bring the occurrence of chaos in the nonintegrable case.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study revisits the Starobinsky inflation model after ACT results, finding that increasing e-folds and lowering reheating temp help satisfy the data. They suggest a combination of tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating to balance observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about addressing discrepancies between Starobinsky inflation predictions and ACT measurements by adjusting model parameters such as e-folds and reheating temperature. This is likely aimed at improving the model's fit with observational data like those from the Cosmic Acting Temperature (ACT) experiment, possibly to refine predictions for phenomena like primordial black holes (PBHs).

Method: The authors adjust parameters like the number of e-folds and reheating temperature to match the_ACT constraints. They propose a mixed preheating mechanism that combines both tachyonic and non-tachyonic stages to achieve a favorable balance between various cosmological observables, such as PBH abundance and low reheating temperatures.

Result: The key result is that through modifying e-folds and reheating temperature, the Starobinsky model aligns better with ACT, especially at 68% confidence level. Additionally, merging tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating can reduce discrepancies and potentially lower the required reheating temperature, which supports observations related to PBHs and early universe physics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that fine-tuning Starobinsky inflation with e-folds, reheating temp, and a mixed preheating approach can enhance the model's consistency with recent observational data. This suggests the model could better explain phenomena like PBHs and offer implications for early universe physics and cosmology.

Abstract: In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation and its reheating
features after the ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model satisfy ACT with
$68\%$ CL, the number of e-folds increases to $>70$ while the reheating
temperature drops to $10^4$ GeV. The preheating stages and the reheating
temperature need to be adjusted drastically in favor of the lower temperature.
We obtain that the preheating stage of Starobinsky inflation should be mixed
between tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating to favor the analytical
estimation, PBH abundance, and the low reheating temperature at once. For that
purpose, a varied momentum is necessary to obtain the favored results.

Abstract: This study explores the possible formation of asymptotically flat traversable
wormholes within dark matter halos under the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity.
The wormhole solutions are derived based on the King and Navarro-Frenk-White
dark matter density profiles associated with anisotropic matter sources. For a
particular set of parameters, the proposed shape functions are found to be
positively increasing and satisfy all the essential geometric conditions along
with the flare-out condition, thereby supporting asymptotically flat
traversable wormholes. To study the underlying matter content responsible for
the wormhole structures, we analyze the null energy condition at the wormhole
throat and provide graphical representations of various energy conditions,
highlighting both the regions where they are satisfied and where they are
violated. The stability of the reported wormhole solutions is confirmed through
the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. In addition, we explore
several physical features of the wormhole configurations, including the
embedding surface, complexity factor, active gravitational mass, and total
gravitational energy. Moreover, we investigate the deflection of light by these
wormholes, finding that the deflection angle approaches zero at large
distances, where the wormhole's gravity is negligible, and diverges near the
throat, where the gravitational influence is extremely strong.

*Mina Chapon,Lionel Darondeau,Rodrigue Desmorat,Clément Ecker,Boris Kolev*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper extends Souriau's variational relativity to a second-order gradient theory in General Relativity, introducing new invariants and examining their classical limits to link with continuum mechanics. The approach clarifies higher gradient theories' theoretical foundation by deriving them from relativistic principles, distinguishing between objective and non-objective quantities in different limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds upon Souriau's foundational work in variational relativity and extends it to a more complex, higher-order framework. This extension is significant because higher gradient theories are relevant in understanding material behaviors with microstructure and non-local effects, which have applications in diverse fields such as elasticity, plasticity, and material science.

Method: The authors employ variational calculus in a relativistic setting, considering higher-order gradients. They derive new curvature invariants and analyze their contributions to continuum mechanics by examining the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations and their implications in the Galilean limit.

Result: The paper successfully extends Souriau's framework to second-order theories, revealing how these invariants relate both relativistically and in the classical limit to higher gradient continuum mechanics. This work enhances the theoretical underpinnings of more advanced material models and provides a bridge between relativistic field theories and classical continuum mechanics.

Conclusion: This study deepens our understanding of the variational foundations of higher gradient theories in General Relativity. By linking new relativistic invariants to continuum mechanics concepts, the work paves the way for more accurate models in continuum mechanics, particularly in contexts involving complex material behavior and relativistic effects. The insights into objective vs. non-objective quantities are valuable for both theoretical and applied mechanics.

Abstract: Variational Relativity is a framework developed by Souriau in the sixties to
better formulate General Relativity and its classical limit\,: Classical
Continuum Mechanics. It has been used, for instance, to formulate
Hyperelasticity in General Relativity. In that case, two primary variables are
involved, the universe (Lorentzian) metric $g$ and the matter field $\Psi$. A
Lagrangian density depending on the 1-jet of these variables is then introduced
which must satisfy the principle of General Covariance. Souriau proved in 1958
that under these hypotheses, the Lagrangian density depends only on the
punctual value of the matter field $\Psi$ and of a secondary variable
$\mathbf{K}$, the conformation, an invariant of the diffeomorphism group, which
is the Relativistic analog of the inverse of the right Cauchy--Green tensor. In
the present work, an extension of Souriau's results to a second order gradient
theory in General Relativity is presented. Accordingly, new higher order
diffeomorphisms invariants are found. Their classical limits are calculated,
showing that the 3-dimensional Continuum Mechanics second gradient theory can
be derived from such a relativistic theory. Some of these invariants converge
to objective quantities in the Galilean limit, others to non-objective
quantities. The present work contributes thus to clarify the theoretical
foundation of higher gradient Continuum Mechanics theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve technical challenges in simulating binary black hole dynamics, particularly in unequal mass mergers and understanding dephasing effects.

Abstract: It has only recently become possible to simulate the full nonlinear dynamics
of binary black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity. The
simulations remain technically challenging and evolutions of unequal mass
binaries in particular have been difficult to follow through the merger. Even
when the merger is successful, accurately quantifying the physical dephasing,
as opposed to contributions from transients in the initial data and gauge
adjustments, remains difficult. We show the first full simulations of 2:1 and
3:1 binaries through merger, and we discuss how specific choices in the setup
affect the dephasing observed and our ability to obtain reliable results. In
cases with weaker couplings, we match the expected PN value for the dephasing,
whereas for larger couplings, eccentricity introduced by the initial data
transients can lead to artificial deviations. Our work highlights the need for
improvements in the initial data methods used, to ensure reliable waveforms are
obtained for data analysis in beyond-GR models.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational lensing effects of non-linear
electrodynamic black holes. Non-linear electrodynamic black holes serve as
typical models for multi-event horizon black holes. Depending on the choice of
metric parameters, these black holes can possess more than five event horizons.
Consequently, within certain parameter ranges, black holes can have more than
three photon spheres of varying sizes outside the event horizon. Specifically,
we focus on the strong gravitational lensing effects near the triple photon
spheres, particularly the formation of higher-order images of point sources and
celestial spheres. The presence of one, two, or three or more photon spheres
significantly increases the number of higher-order images of a point source.
When a black hole is illuminated by a celestial sphere, the three photon
spheres generate three critical curves in the black hole image, with the
smallest critical curve coinciding with the shadow's edge. Additionally, since
non-linear electrodynamic black holes are models of multi-event horizon black
holes, we can infer the gravitational lensing effects and the changes in
celestial images for black holes with more than three photon spheres by
analyzing the distinctions and patterns between the gravitational lensing
effects of one, two, and three photon spheres.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the combined effects of quantum gravity induced by
non-commutativity and scale-dependent gravitational coupling on the thermal
properties of the thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole. We
consider a $\kappa$-deformed Renormalization Group Induced (RGI) Schwarzschild
black hole, where the classical Schwarzschild black hole geometry is modified
by the $\kappa$-deformation of space-time and the running Newton's coupling
constant $G(r)$. Using the modified metric, we derive the geodesic motion of
massive particles, the effective potential, and the thermal properties such as
the radiated energy flux, and the temperature profile of the accretion disk
around the $\kappa$-deformed RGI-Schwarzschild black hole. Our study shows that
when non-commutativity is combined with the RGI framework, the effects produce
a noticeable deviation from the classical Schwarzschild case. In particular,
for small values of the deformation parameter, we observe an increase in the
peak energy flux and the temperature of the accretion disk. This suggests that
quantum gravity corrections enhance the disk's radiative efficiency, especially
in the inner regions close to the black hole.

Abstract: We investigate a recently derived Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) immersed
in a Dehnen-type $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(1,4,5/2)$ dark matter (DM) halo. We
obtain constraints on the two model parameters, i.e., the halo core radius
$r_s$ and the DM density parameter $\rho_s$ in both the weak and the strong
field regimes. In the weak field, we model test particle geodesics and match
the predicted perihelion shift to Mercury (Solar System) and the orbit of the
S2 star data, obtaining upper limits on $r_s$ and $\rho_s$. In the strong
field, we analyse twin high frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) from
four microquasars (e.g., GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, and XTE
J1550-564). Because QPO frequencies depend only on the local spacetime
curvature, they can serve as a probe of halo-induced deviations from general
relativity. Our MCMC analysis produces posterior distributions for model
parameters, revealing close agreement between the theoretical QPO frequencies
and the observations for GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40. The same analysis also
yielded best-fit values and upper bounds for each parameter. Our combined
geodesic and QPO analysis demonstrates that timelike orbits and epicyclic
oscillations can act as sensitive probes of DM halos around BHs, offering a
pathway to distinguish Dehnen-type profiles from alternative DM distributions
in future analysis and observations.

Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) models are characterized by the deformation
of relativistic symmetries at the Planck scale and constitute one of the
cornerstones for quantum gravity phenomenology research, due to the possibility
of testing them with cosmological messengers. Some of their predictions
manifest themselves as relative locality effects, implying that events local to
an observer might not appear to be so for a distant one. In this work we focus
on transverse relative locality models, where the delocalization occurs along
the direction perpendicular to the one connecting two distant observers. We
present the first generalization of these models in curved spacetime,
constructing a transverse deformation of the de Sitter algebra in 2 + 1 D and
investigating its phenomenological implications on particle propagation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for comparing population-synthesis models with gravitational-wave data by directly comparing observable populations, which respects the model's domain of validity and requires an adjusted approach to handling selection effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational-wave astronomy relies on population-synthesis models, but comparing these models with data requires careful consideration of selection effects. Current methods involve inferring astrophysical distributions, but this paper suggests an alternative approach by comparing observable populations directly.

Method: The paper proposes comparing observable compact-binary populations directly instead of inferring the generating population distribution. This approach respects the model's domain of validity and requires incorporating selection effects in a different manner.

Result: The authors demonstrate that unbiased inference of the observable compact-binary population is possible using their observable-space reconstruction method. They apply this method to LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from their third observing run and show its potential by comparing results with a fiducial population-synthesis model.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a new way to utilize gravitational-wave data more effectively, with implications for improved understanding of the compact-binary population and its properties.

Abstract: Comparing population-synthesis models to the results of hierarchical Bayesian
inference in gravitational-wave astronomy requires a careful understanding of
the domain of validity of the models fitted to data. This comparison is usually
done using the inferred astrophysical distribution: from the data that were
collected, one deconvolves selection effects to reconstruct the generating
population distribution. In this letter, we demonstrate the benefits of instead
comparing observable populations directly. In this approach, the domain of
validity of the models is trivially respected, such that only the relevant
parameter space regions as predicted by the astrophysical models of interest
contribute to the comparison. We clarify that unbiased inference of the
observable compact-binary population is indeed possible. Crucially, this
approach still requires incorporating selection effects, but in a manner that
differs from the standard implementation. We apply our observable-space
reconstruction to LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from their third observing run and
illustrate its potential by comparing the results to the predictions of a
fiducial population-synthesis model.
