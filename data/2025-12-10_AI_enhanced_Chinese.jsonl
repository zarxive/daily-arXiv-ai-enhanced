Instead of treating \\(B\\) only as a static function of body mass \\(M\\), we adopt the form \\(B(n) = B_0 \\, M^{\\,b(n)}\\), in which the effective scaling exponent \\(b(n)\\) varies systematically throughout development. In contrast to classical approaches, such as Kleiber's empirical law (\\(B \\propto M^{3/4}\\)) and the continuous fractal model of West--Brown--Enquist (WBE), which assume a constant exponent, the present framework emphasizes how the metabolic scaling relationship itself can evolve over the life cycle of a single individual. The model is inspired by a Fibonacci-based description of growth in discrete stages, leading to analytic expressions for \\(b(n)\\) that connect ontogenetic progression to changes in the scaling between metabolism and mass. In this setting, Kleiber's constant \\(B_0 \\approx 70\\) kcal/day is reinterpreted as a \\emph{metabolic anchoring point}, linking the classical law \\(B \\approx 70\\,M^{3/4}\\) to a developmentally explicit formulation. We show that the resulting trajectory \\(B(n)\\) captures, at a conceptual level, how metabolic scaling can shift from strongly sublinear behavior at early stages towards an almost linear regime as \\(n\\) increases, and that the predicted basal rates remain compatible, in order of magnitude, with values reported for mammals of different sizes. In this way, the work offers a unified framework that connects the evolution of \\(B(n)\\) across ontogeny to the recursive organization of biological growth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4f53\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\u6570\u5217\u7684\u751f\u957f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u4e0e\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bf9\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u4e0e\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u9010\u6e10\u663e\u5f97\u4e0d\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2a\u4f53\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u663e\u5f97\u529b\u4e0d\u4ece\u5fc3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u7740\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\u6570\u5217\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9012\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u968f\u9636\u6bb5\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6307\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u7684\u4ee3\u8c22\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u968f\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6240\u8c13\u7684'\u4ee3\u8c22\u951a\u5b9a\u70b9'\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4e2a\u4f53\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee3\u8c22\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0ccipher\u4e86\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e2a\u4f53\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee3\u8c22\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u8c22\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u4ee3\u8c22\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Most theoretical models assume static environments and passive bacterial hosts, neglecting the joint effects of bacterial traits and environmental fluctuations on coexistence dynamics. This limitation hinders the prediction of microbial persistence in dynamic ecosystems such as soils and oceans.Using a minimal ordinary differential equation framework, we show that the bacterial growth rate and the phage adsorption rate collectively determine three possible ecological outcomes: phage extinction, stable coexistence, or oscillation-induced extinction. Specifically, we demonstrate that environmental fluctuations can suppress destructive oscillations through resonance, promoting coexistence where static models otherwise predict collapse. Counterintuitively, we find that lower bacterial growth rates are helpful in enhancing survival under high infection pressure, elucidating the observed post-infection growth reduction.Our studies reframe bacterial hosts as active builders of ecological dynamics and environmental variation as a potential stabilizing force. Our findings thus bridge a key theory-experiment gap and provide a foundational framework for predicting microbial responses to environmental stress, which might have potential implications for phage therapy, microbiome management, and climate-impacted community resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While such patterns resemble structures from equilibrium phase separation, they are intrinsically non-equilibrium, driven by energy-consuming enzymatic cycles that switch molecules like phosphoinositides or small GTPases between distinct states. Here, we develop a minimal model of this enzyme-driven phase ordering process. Starting from microscopic reaction kinetics, we derive a mesoscopic theory that belongs to the class of active Model A with a global constraint. This framework yields an explicit mean-field phase diagram and closed-form expressions for key observables, such as interfacial tension, domain fractions, and phase coexistence boundaries, in terms of kinetic rates. In this context, phase coexistence is controlled by non-equilibrium parameters like catalytic rates and enzymatic asymmetry, rather than equilibrium parameters such as saturation concentrations. The resulting phase-separated domains rapidly exchange material with their surroundings. Their maintenance requires a continuous power input determined by enzymatic kinetics. The predicted phenomenology is consistent with experimental observations on reconstituted systems of phosphoinositide and Rab5 membrane patterning. We further study how metastable uniform states decay via nucleation of minority-phase domains and subsequent coarsening, driven by an effective interfacial tension. Using large deviation theory, we derive the critical nucleation radius under the action of the intrinsic, multiplicative chemical noise. The analytical results are quantitatively confirmed by stochastic simulations of the process.

In contrast, experimental trajectories, such as those from single-particle tracking (SPT), are typically scarce and may differ substantially from the idealized models used for simulation, leading to degradation or even breakdown of performance when ML methods are applied to real data. To address this mismatch, we introduce a wavelet-based representation of anomalous diffusion that enables data-efficient learning directly from experimental recordings. This representation is constructed by applying six complementary wavelet families to each trajectory and combining the resulting wavelet modulus scalograms. We first evaluate the wavelet representation on simulated trajectories from the andi-datasets benchmark, where it clearly outperforms both feature-based and trajectory-based methods with as few as 1000 training trajectories and still retains an advantage on large training sets. We then use this representation to learn directly from experimental SPT trajectories of fluorescent beads diffusing in F-actin networks, where the wavelet representation remains superior to existing alternatives for both diffusion-exponent regression and mesh-size classification. In particular, when predicting the diffusion exponents of experimental trajectories, a model trained on 1200 experimental tracks using the wavelet representation achieves significantly lower errors than state-of-the-art deep learning models trained purely on $10^6$ simulated trajectories. We associate this data efficiency with the emergence of distinct scale fingerprints disentangling underlying diffusion mechanisms in the wavelet spectra.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By systematically varying the projectile's impact point and orientation relative to the molecular plane, we compare orthogonal and in-plane trajectories and quantify their effects on fragment momenta, electron-density response, and atom-resolved ionization. Newton plots and time-resolved density snapshots show that trajectories avoiding direct atomic collisions yield the most faithful structural reconstructions, whereas direct impacts impart large, highly localized momenta that distort the recovered geometry. Planar trajectories generate substantially greater ionization and broader momentum distributions than orthogonal ones due to deeper traversal through the molecular electron cloud. Quantitative analysis of electron removal at 10~fs confirms that projectile proximity and orientation strongly modulate both local and global ionization. These findings clarify how impact geometry governs the fidelity of ion-induced CEI structural recovery and help explain the variability and noise observed in experimental CEI measurements. More broadly, the results highlight both the strengths and the intrinsic limitations of ion-induced CEI and identify key considerations for interpreting experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using Schwinger parametrization and the one-to-one correspondence between metric ribboned graphs and the moduli space of Riemann surfaces established via Strebel differentials, we map each Feynman diagram to a surface. We then construct a conformal field theory on the worldsheet whose correlation functions encode the full set of QFT Feynman rules directly from the geometry of the associated Riemann surface. Restoring diffeomorphism and Weyl invariance promotes the integral over moduli space to a path integral over worldsheet metrics, yielding a non-critical string theory whose Liouville mode naturally becomes a holographic direction. By construction, the expansion of the string theory amplitudes in the number of boundary state insertions matches the loop expansion in the QFT at fixed genus. Moreover, loop divergences are shown to match standard string-theoretic degeneration limits, indicating that gravitational backreaction is equivalent to QFT renormalization.

We posit that fundamental quantum mechanical operations, superposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement, naturally map to essential reasoning primitives such as hypothesis branching, constraint propagation, consistency enforcement, and decision making. The resulting framework combines quantum-inspired computation with differentiable optimization, enabling reasoning to emerge as a process of amplitude evolution and interference-driven selection of self-consistent states. We develop the mathematical foundation of QCRM, define its parameterized circuit architecture, and show how logical rules can be encoded as unitary transformations over proposition-qubit states. We further formalize a training objective grounded in classical gradient descent over circuit parameters and discuss simulation-based implementations on classical hardware.

By precisely controlling the initial vortex separation, we identify configurations in which leapfrogging breaks down and determine the corresponding dissipation mechanisms. The first originates from phase-slip events occurring at large injected velocities. The second arises when the injection of multi-charged vortices leads to the formation of a dispersive shock wave which acts as a continuous source of phase slippage.

Two different strategies are proposed to solve the problem. In the first one, Bloch's assumption is first applied to the equations of motion, and then the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the complex normal form style in the parametrisation method is applied. This direct procedure, which applies first the wave dependency to the original physical coordinates of the problem, is referred to as CNF-BP (for CNF applied with Bloch's assumption on physical coordinates). In the second strategy, the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the parametrisation method, which relates the physical coordinates to the so-called normal coordinates, is first applied. Then the periodic assumption is used, thus imposing a Bloch wave ansatz on the normal coordinates. This method will be referred to as CNF-PN (for CNF with a periodic assumption on normal coordinates). In the conservative case, the CNF-PN strategy exhibits superior capability in capturing complex wave propagation phenomena, whereas the CNF-BP strategy encounters limitations in handling non-fundamental harmonics and the nonlinear interactions between host oscillators. For underdamped systems, the CNF-PN is rigorously validated and systematically compared against numerical techniques, a classical analytical perturbation technique (the method of multiple scales), and direct numerical time integration of annular chain structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, silicon-based method for sensor fabrication is limited by high cost, rigidity, and multi-step cleanroom processes. This study presents a single-step fiber laser micromachining method for fabricating biocompatible, free-standing MEMS thermal flow sensors from ultrathin titanium foil. The process combines patterning and localized thinning in single-step process, with titanium serving as resistive sensing element. A dual-matrix optimization approach consisting of a Threshold Mapping Matrix (TMM) and Energy Density Matrix (EDM) was used to determine optimized parameters without repeated trial-and-error. For localized thinning, sequential R-T scans with cooling intervals reduced redeposition from the Gaussian beam profile and produced uniform thickness reduction from 50 \u03bcm to 20--30 \u03bcm. The fabricated sensors were evaluated through thermal coefficient resistance (TCR) measurement, Infrared (IR) thermography, and airflow tests under steady and cyclic conditions controlled by artificial ventilation system. The fabricated devices showed a stable TCR of 3278 ppm \u00b0C$^{-1}$, a linear relationship calibration curve between velocity and resistance with $R^2$=0.986 and a 54% improvement in thermal response was achieved with the free-standing structure design compared to substrate-fixed designs. This fabrication approach removes the need for photolithography, wet/dry etching, and wafer bonding, enabling faster and lower-cost production of flexible, biocompatible flow sensors.

We obtain, combining kinetic and complex network theory, an analytical expression for the spreading threshold that depends not only on the first but also second moment of the speed distribution. Moreover, we prove that spreading can even occur for vanishing average active speed.

In this work, we introduce an ordinal odor strength data set of over 2,000 molecules by integrating two different public sources, mapping structures to odorless, low, medium, and high categories. Across several molecular encodings and supervised learning algorithms we compared different prediction strategies. Dimensionality reduction and SHAP analysis identifies molecular size, polarity, ring features, and branching as primary drivers, consistent with mass-transport constraints on volatility, sorption, and receptor access.

However, for gravitational EFTs, this geometry is not uniquely defined: one can cast the action in many synonymous descriptions related by Weyl transformations, in which the field space metric transforms non-trivially across conformal frames. This raises a crucial question of how we are meant to think of the field space metric in view of employing the Swampland Conjectures. In this work we resolve this ambiguity by developing a fully frame-covariant framework for studying gravitational EFTs. We show that all conformal frames arise as distinct foliations of a singular higher-dimensional auxiliary geometry. Applying ADM formalism to the augmented field space, it is clear how Weyl- and unit transformations can be understood from a geometric point of view. Using this framework, we revisit the Species Scale Distance Conjecture and Sharpened Distance Conjecture, and show how the bounds derive from universal properties of gravitational EFTs under Weyl transformations. This strongly suggests that aspects of these conjectures apply to a much broader class of scalar-tensor theories and are consequences of frame covariance, rather than constraints imposed by quantum gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Field space geometry within gravitational EFTs isn't uniquely defined due to Weyl transformations across conformal frames.

Using topological methods, we first analyze the configuration of photon spheres and confirm that unstable circular photon spheres with topological charge $(\u03c9= -1)$ exist outside the event horizon throughout the parameter space, thereby verifying the simultaneous validity of both the WGC and the WCCC. The rainbow functions $f(\\varepsilon)$ and $g(\\varepsilon)$, which encode Planck-scale corrections through the energy ratio $(\\varepsilon =E/E_P)$, modify both the spacetime metric and the extremality bound. We derive the corresponding modified extremal charge-to-mass ratio, $(q^2/m^2)>(Q^2/M^2)_{\\text{ext}}$, and show that gravity's rainbow offers a natural mechanism for reconciling these two fundamental conjectures. By applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in conjunction with Jacobi-Maupertuis optical geometry, we compute the weak deflection angles for both photons and massive particles to second order.

All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions.\n  The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80\\%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics.\n  These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements.

Classically, the system is integrable and presents three independent constants of motion, namely, the energy, the $z$-component of the angular momentum, and a third dynamical constant associated with the paraboloidal geometry, which can be derived from the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories.

Physically, this is manifested by a very small characteristic energy scale for shear density fluctuations, which are gapless excitations in a translationally invariant system.

We illustrate this general principle by explicit microscopic model calculations, showing that this mechanism very effectively stabilizes disordered Wigner lattices to much higher temperatures and densities than in the clean limit. On the other hand, we argue that in two dimensions disorder significantly ``smears\" the melting transition, producing spatial coexistence of solid-like and liquid-like regions -- just as recently observed in STM experiments.

Supplementary Material: 6 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental tool in modern laser technology, enabling coherent frequency conversion to remote optical bands, serving as the basis for self-referenced femtosecond lasers and quadrature-squeezed light sources. State-of-the-art SHG relies on bulk crystals and ridge waveguides, although continuous-wave (CW) SH efficiency in bulk crystals is limited by short interaction lengths and large mode areas. Ridge waveguides offer better performance with lower pump power requirements, yet must span several centimeters to deliver high output power, complicating fabrication and narrowing the bandwidth. Recently, SHG in periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonic circuits has attracted significant interest, offering orders-of-magnitude improvement in SHG under CW pumping due to the stronger optical mode confinement. However, lithium niobate has a low optical damage threshold, even in MgO-doped substrates, which limits SH power output to well below the watt level. Here, we overcome this challenge and demonstrate 7 mm-long periodically poled thin-film lithium tantalate (PPLT) waveguides that achieve high SH output in the CW regime, with generated power exceeding 1 W and off-chip output above 0.5 W at 775 nm under 4.5 W pump power. PPLT offers a higher optical damage threshold than PPLN and supports watt-level operation. By optimizing electrode geometry and poling conditions, we obtain reproducible poling despite lithium tantalate's coercive field being nearly four times higher than that of MgO-doped lithium niobate. Although its effective nonlinearity is more than five times lower, we achieve watt-level CW output with a short waveguide, demonstrating the potential of PPLT circuits for high-power applications in integrated lasers, quantum photonics, AMO physics, optical clocks, and frequency metrology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316PPLT\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5236\u5907\u5de5\u827a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2SHG\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u77ed\u6ce2\u5bfc\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u5149\u6e90\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u6fc0\u5149\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8c10\u6ce2\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6fc0\u5149\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u514b\u670dPPLT\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u635f\u4f24\u9608\u503c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316PPLT\u7684\u7535\u6781\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5236\u5907\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u957f7mm\u7684PPLT\u6ce2\u5bfc\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u963b\u70e7\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u8868\u9762\u629b\u5149\u7684PPLT\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u6cf5\u6d66\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc71\u74e6\u7684\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0PPLT\u6750\u6599\u4e0b\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8c10\u6ce2\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc71\u74e6\u7684\u53d1\u5149\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u5728775nm\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc70.5\u74e6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u7c7b\u6750\u6599\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u6027\u504f\u7f6e\u81f4\u6ce2\u5bb6\u65cf\u591a\u5c42\u8584\u819c\u6ce2\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u5728\u9ad8\u529f\u7387SHG\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u4e92\u8865\u6ce2\u5bfc\u65cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Scintillator-based detectors are widely employed to monitor fast ions; however, existing studies often assume isotropic light emission, neglecting potential angular dependencies that can compromise the determination of ion fluxes. In this work, we investigate the angular emission properties of two commercial scintillators, TG-Green and b-SiAlON, under irradiation with 3.5 MeV He++ and 1 MeV D+ beams, representative of conditions in future fusion devices such as ITER. A novel experimental setup, combining precise optical alignment, angular scanning, and rigorous calibration, was developed to measure the detection efficiency as a function of observation angle. Prior to the characterization, stability tests demonstrated negligible radiation-induced degradation under the applied fluences, and transmission losses due to optical fiber bending were found to be below 1.5%. The results reveal a pronounced angular anisotropy in scintillation emission for both materials, with intensity decreasing as the detection angle increases, well described by an empirical cosine-based model. Additionally, the normalized response shows minimal dependence on ion species or energy.

Focusing on the single exchange of a massive scalar field, we demonstrate that the trispectrum splits cleanly into its local and non-local components once the heavy-field propagators are decomposed in the Keldysh basis. Integrating out the massive degree of freedom yields a single-field effective field theory for the light scalar that necessarily contains both unitary operators and non-unitary contributions associated with dissipation and stochastic noise. We show that the leading local signal in parity-preserving theories arises from the unitary part of this effective field theory, whereas the non-local signal is intrinsically associated with its stochastic sector. The effective field theory coefficients themselves are a priori non-analytic in the external kinematics; however, this non-analyticity can be softened when a scale hierarchy - such as the heavy-mass expansion - is imposed, up to spurious contributions that ultimately cancel in observables.

A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $\u03bb$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory.

We use a Feshbach resonance to access attractive interactions with $^6$Li atoms.

This is possible because the tunneling current under the tip is an extremely localized electrical excitation source. However, in most STML applications, the spatial distribution of the emission relative to the excitation point is unresolved. Yet this distribution contains key information about how the interaction of excitons with injected charge carriers affects the luminescence of these materials, and about exciton transport. Resolving this spatial distribution at the nanoscale is relevant both for a fundamental understanding of exciton physics and for device applications; yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, we resolve the spatial distribution of the emission beyond the diffraction limit of light by deconvolving real-space optical microscopy images of the STML using an iterative algorithm, i.e., Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution. To showcase this technique, we apply it to the STML of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($\\mathrm{WSe_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\\mathrm{WS_2}$). Thus, we highlight hitherto ignored or misunderstood aspects of STML on 2D semiconductors related to exciton and charge carrier transport, namely the dependence of the spatial distribution of emission on the tunnel current setpoint and the origin of the emission from hot spots located micrometers from the excitation source.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper uses Richardson-Lucy deconvolution to map the emission distribution in STML of WSe\u2082 and WS\u2082 beyond the diffraction limit, revealing insights into exciton and charge carrier transport physics.", "motivation": "Understanding the relationship between exciton interactions, charge carrier transport, and luminescence sources is crucial for both fundamental physics and device applications.", "method": "The researchers developed an iterative deconvolution algorithm based on the Richardson-Lucy method to analyze STML images, achieving sub-diffraction resolution.", "result": "The study demonstrated that the spatial distribution of emission in STML depends on the tunnel current setpoint and the presence of hotspots micrometers from the excitation source.", "conclusion": "Mapping emission distribution at the nanoscale with STML paves the way for advancing our understanding of 2D semiconductor physics and improving optoelectronic devices."}}

In particular, static meta-optical encoders designed for task-specific pre-processing demonstrated orders of magnitude smaller energy consumption over purely digital counterpart, albeit at the cost of slight degradation in classification accuracy. However, a lack of generalizability poses serious challenges for wide deployment of static meta-optical front-ends. Here, we investigate the utility of a metalens for generalized computer vision. Specifically, we show that a metalens optimized for full-color imaging can achieve image classification accuracy comparable to high-end, sensor-limited optics and consistently outperforms a hyperboloid metalens across a wide range of sensor pixel sizes. We further design an end-to-end single aperture metasurface for ImageNet classification and find that the optimized metasurface tends to balance the modulation transfer function (MTF) for each wavelength.

Together with excellent energy resolution and the t$_0$ provided by primary scintillation, this topological information is key to suppressing backgrounds. Preserving EL, however, requires operating in pure xenon (with helium as the only benign additive), and in pure xenon the diffusion of drifting electrons is large. As a result, the fidelity of reconstructed tracks is limited both by diffusion and by the intrinsic blurring of EL amplification.\n  We propose augmenting the detector with the ability to image not only the electron track but also the corresponding mirror ion track. Introducing trace amounts of NH$_3$ ($\\sim$100 ppb) converts Xe$^+$ ions into NH$_4^+$ while leaving EL unaffected. For events in the region-of-interest, an ion sensor positioned near the cathode at the projected barycenter captures the NH$_4^+$ ions. Electrons drift rapidly to the anode, producing the standard EL image, whereas the NH$_4^+$ ions drift slowly toward the cathode. Their slow drift provides time to determine the event energy and barycenter. Laser interrogation of the sensor's molecular layer then reveals an ion-track image with sub-millimeter diffusion and no EL-induced smearing.\n  The combined electron-ion imaging substantially strengthens topological discrimination, improving background rejection by about an order of magnitude and significantly extending the discovery potential of GXeEL TPCs for very long $0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$ lifetimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165NH3\u589e\u5f3aXe+\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u6210\u50cf\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u79bb\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2\u8870\u53d8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad80\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2\u8870\u53d8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u8870\u53d8\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6c14\u6001\u6c19\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u6295\u5f71\u5ba4\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6210\u50cf\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u79bb\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165NH3\u5728\u5176\u8fc1\u79fb\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u7387\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u964d\u4f4e backgrounds\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165NH3\u5728\u5176\u8fc1\u79fb\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u7387\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5c06Xe+\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aNH4+\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7535\u5b50\u8fc5\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u9633\u6781\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u800cNH4+\u5219\u7f13\u6162\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u9634\u6781\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u522b\u6355\u83b7\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u79bb\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u5149\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u6210\u50cf\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u79bb\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2\u8870\u53d8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u97f3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8870\u53d8\u534a\u8870\u671f\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7NH3\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u79bb\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2\u8870\u53d8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

By extending lessons from classical benchmarking and incorporating application-driven and energy-aware metrics, we outline a framework that enables practitioners to evaluate quantum methods responsibly, ensuring reproducibility, comparability, and trust in reported results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u516c\u6b63\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u6355\u6349\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6982\u7387\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u539f\u5219\u548c\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5e94\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u66f4\u52a0\u8d23\u4efb\u53ef\u0165\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e94\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u52a0\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u900f\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $\u03b6$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant, and no influence gravitational field equations in $D<5$ spacetimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly.

In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems.

Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals. These results demonstrate that SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "SP-SAXS helps study nanoparticle formation using single-particle diffraction.", "motivation": "The study aims to understand the morphological processes of CoO nanocrystal assemblies formation through solvothermal synthesis.", "method": "Single-particle small-angle X-ray scattering (SP-SAXS) with X-ray free-electron lasers is used to analyze the nanoparticles.", "result": "SP-SAXS reveals transient intermediates that directly form hierarchical aggregates, explaining the structure of CoO nanocrystals.", "conclusion": "SP-SAXS is effective in analyzing morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle synthesis."}}

Two identical copies of the unknown quantum field illuminate laterally displaced slits, guaranteeing perfect spatiotemporal mode matching without a separate local oscillator. In the far-field, detection at transverse position $x$ is associated with a relative slit phase $\u03c6(x)$, and an $N$-photon event projects the detected quantum field onto a state $|N;\u03c6(x)\\rangle$. The resulting distribution $P(N,\u03c6)$ is the quantum analogue of a Frequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) trace: whereas FROG reconstructs the classical complex spectral field $E(\u03c9)$ from a spectrally resolved second harmonic of a pulse with its delayed self, our measurement reconstructs the Fock-space wavefunction or density matrix from binomially weighted self-interference. The scheme requires no known or mode-matched reference and is compatible with commercially available photon-number-resolving cameras.

Local conservation laws, expressed as $\\nabla_\u03bc\\langle J^\u03bc\\rangle=0$, imply that when baryon number is lost across a horizon its conserved quantum numbers are sequestered into inaccessible modes, producing an effective depletion in the exterior sector. Global unitarity therefore requires compensating source terms in the exterior continuity equations. We show that relativity forces these compensating excitations to arise through long-wavelength geometric modes: only infrared fluctuations can restore entropy and charge while remaining outside the causal wedge of the infalling matter. This identifies an infrared return channel as a generic feature of horizon-coupled semiclassical gravity.\n  The second ingredient is a Carnot-Carath\u00e9odory (CC) tangent geometry, whose mesoscopic scale $\u03c3$ governs both the excitation of these IR modes and the kinematics of photon and matter propagation.

While effective, these models require tens of thousands of parameters and heavy pre-processing. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to real, experimental pulse waveforms from a germanium detector. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid approach using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) with amplitude encoding.

We examine the extent to which current prescriptions for holographic complexity support this claim, focusing on the Complexity=Volume (CV) proposal. The reformulation of CV in terms of Lorentzian threads suggests that bulk computations are performed with local gates. However, we find that the original formalism is insufficient when it comes to analyzing the complexity of subsystems and their inequalities. Specifically, standard Lorentzian threads cannot account for the negativity of `mutual complexity' and its higher-partite generalizations. To address this deficiency, we modify the Lorentzian threads program by introducing multiple flavors of threads. Our analysis reveals that an optimal solution for this new program implies the existence of additional types of gates that enable nonlocal computations in the dual CFT. We give a tentative interpretation of the multiflavor program in terms of Lorentzian `hyperthreads,' in analogy with the Riemannian case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u590d\u6742\u5ea6=\u4f53\u79ef (CV) \u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u9610\u8ff0 bulk \u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u534f\u8bae\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684 CV \u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e92\u60e0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7a7f\u8d8a\u7684 threads \u7406\u8bba\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u7684 threads \u7406\u8bba\u6697\u793a\u7740\u5b58\u5728\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95e8\u4f7f\u5f97\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u7684 CFT \u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": " holography \u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9\u5076\u7684 CFTs \u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0 bulk \u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u7684 CV \u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4fee\u6b63\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63 Lorentzian threads \u7406\u8bba\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6 CV \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u7a7f\u8d8a\u7684 threads\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684 threads \u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95e8\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63 CV \u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7a7f\u8d8a\u7684 threads\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u6697\u793a\u7740\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06 bulk \u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7a7f\u8d8a\u7684 threads\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a bulk \u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3 holography \u548c\u91cf\u5b50 gravity \u7684\u6839\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

These viscosity solutions play a central role in areas such as front propagation, mean-field games, optimal control, machine learning, and a direct application to the forced Burgers' equation. Our method is based on an entropy penalisation method proposed by Gomes and Valdinoci, which generalises the Cole-Hopf transform from quadratic to general convex Hamiltonians, allowing a reformulation of viscous Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics by a discrete-time linear dynamics which approximates a linear heat-like parabolic equation, and can also extend to continuous-time dynamics. This makes the method suitable for quantum simulation. The validity of these results hold for arbitrary nonlinearity that correspond to convex Hamiltonians, and for arbitrarily long times, thus obviating a chief obstacle in most quantum algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations.

While this phenomenon has so far been studied in two-photon systems, exchange symmetries and interference effects in multi-photon scenarios remain largely unexplored. In this work, we show that multi-photon states uncover a rich landscape of exchange symmetries. With three photons already, multiple pairwise combinations are possible, where each pair of photons can exhibit either bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic exchange symmetry. This gives rise to mixed symmetry systems that are not possible to achieve with two photon alone. We experimentally investigate how these symmetry configurations manifest themselves in the observed interference of three photons. We show that multi-photon interference can be effectively turned on and off by tuning the symmetry of the constituent pairs.

Although the overtone frequencies are a concrete prediction of general relativity, it remains an open question whether they are excited to the extent that fits would suggest. In this work, we take a pragmatic approach and investigate the practical utility of each additional overtone in extracting information from the ringdown. We look at the dependence of the ringdown start time on the number of overtones, and the feasibility of detecting deviations from general relativity in the ringdown frequencies. We suggest that there is no clear \"maximum\" overtone, but rather the utility of each additional overtone decreases compared to the one before. Finally, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation (as opposed to least-squares fits) to obtain posterior distributions on the overtone amplitudes and phases, allowing us to investigate their correlation structure. Due to strong correlations it becomes increasingly hard to measure individual amplitudes and phases for the highest overtones. However, we find that the joint measurement of overtone amplitudes (i.e., the correlation structure itself) is sensitive to the frequencies and decay times of even the highest overtones, possibly offering an avenue to perform consistency tests with general relativity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction.

Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper demonstrates that cryogenic SFQ electronics can be used for high-fidelity qubit control in scalable quantum computing architectures.", "motivation": "The motivation stems from the need for scalable quantum processors and addressing decoherence issues in cryogenic quantum computing.", "method": "The research involved moving control electronics to 3 K, optimizing qubit design, and comparing performance metrics between two setups.", "result": "The optimized setup showed significant improvements in gate fidelity (0.46% error) and coherence, outperforming previous methods by an order of magnitude.", "conclusion": "Cryogenic, scalable Josephson microwave sources are feasible for qubit control with high fidelity."}}

We probe the dynamics of an external charged scalar field through its quasinormal modes (QNMs), combining frequency- and time-domain analyses. We find a critical value of the field charge at which the QNM spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of approximately $1/2$.

In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\\bar z$ scaling as $\\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\\bar z \\sim \\log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed.

The material, geometry, and depth profile of the vortices are characterized, providing details of mixing carbon and silica layers, increasing radially from the fiber core center and in thickness to the cladding for longer laser periods (850 nm to 10 micron thickness). The cross-sections of the measured vortices are compared to analytical simulations, revealing unprecedented Fibonacci helices drilling holes in the fiber core with a 5 micron maximum depth, while depositing nanoscale CNT-silica layers following Fibonacci spirals.

Then, Yang-Baxter deformations of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model based on the OSP$(1|2)$ Lie supergroup are specified by super skew-symmetric classical r-matrices. In this regard, the effect coming from the deformation is reflected as the coefficient of both metric and $B$-field. Furthermore, it is shown that all resulting classical r-matrices are non-Abelian and also non-unimodular, which leads us to graded generalized supergravity equations.

When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter.

We first express the EYM integrand by tree-level amplitudes according to the forward limit approach. Employing a two-step expansion strategy, the gluon-loop EYM integrand is decomposed into tree-level YM amplitudes under the forward limit, which are subsequently expanded into tree-level bi-adjoint scalar (BS) ones. We then prove that when the kinematic coefficients in both expansion steps satisfy the one-loop consistency conditions, the EYM integrand is finally expanded as a combination of YM integrands with quadratic propagators. The coefficients in this expansion formula coincide exactly with those in the expansion formula for YMS integrands.

However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $\u03bb\\sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $\u03bb\\sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected.

Efficient inverse design benefits from differentiable models of light-structure interaction. While traditional full-wave solvers based on finite differences, finite elements, or Fourier modal methods have already been presented for that purpose, a dedicated tool adapted for performing multiple scattering simulations is still lacking. To overcome this limitation, we provide a multiple-scattering framework compatible to automatic differentiation, suitable for treating periodic and non-periodic arrangements of scatterers. It yields exact gradients regarding geometric and positional parameters in finite clusters and infinite metasurfaces. In this work, we use spheres as the elementary building blocks to demonstrate the framework's capabilities as a standalone tool. However, the framework is adaptable to arbitrarily shaped scatterers, provided the individual T-matrices are calculated using differentiable full-wave Maxwell solvers. Since the gradients are obtained simultaneously in a single backward pass, the framework is well-suited for moderately dimensional problems. It is also possible to combine multiple performance goals into a single objective function. The versatility of our method is illustrated in proof-of-concept examples that focus on various aspects of Kerker-type physics. In the first example, a finite cluster of scatterers is optimized in order to reach a high forward-to-backward scattering ratio, and we show experimental feasibility of the designs.

Previous studies have developed various approaches to distinguish the SGWB from instrumental noise, often under simplified assumptions such as static or equal-arm configurations. However, in realistic scenarios, time-varying arm-lengths introduce additional complexities that require careful modeling. In this work, we investigate the impact of template construction on SGWB parameter estimation under realistic orbital configurations. Using the simulated SGWB signals and dominant instrumental noise sources, we compare three template strategies: time-averaged template constructed from segmented data, equal-arm template, and a template treating the arm-lengths as a free parameter. Our results show that the time-averaged template yield improves parameter estimation accuracy under time-varying arm-lengths, whereas introducing the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases estimation uncertainty.

The parameter estimation accuracy and uncertainty are quantified for each strategy using these simulations.", "result": "The study finds that the time-averaged template strategy significantly improves the accuracy of parameter estimation for the SGWB under realistic, time-varying arm-length scenarios. This is likely due to the template taking into account the varying orientations of the detector arms, which better matches the actual configurations of space-based detectors. On the other hand, treating the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases the estimation uncertainty, possibly because it introduces additional variability that is not accounted for in the simulations.", "conclusion": "The results emphasize the importance of developing realistic template construction methods for the SGWB parameter estimation in future space-based gravitational wave missions. The study highlights the benefits of employing a time-averaged template strategy under time-varying arm-length conditions and cautions against the potential pitfalls of introducing additional parameters without sufficient justification. As the field advances toward building and utilizing space-based detectors, more sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques will be essential for improving the accuracy and reliability of SGWB analysis."}}

Within the space of solutions is a large ensemble of ultracompact objects exhibiting many of the features of extremal BTZ black holes, in particular having a deep $AdS_2$ throat. We present the details of solutions with circular source profiles, and compare them to known superstratum geometries. The separation of the sources makes them structurally more like BPS fivebrane stars than like extremal black hole microstates. When evaluated on the supergravity background, the brane effective action governs (chaotic) near-BPS dynamics, and exhibits a collective mode analogous to the Schwarzian mode of $AdS_2$ black holes.

Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into \"Coulomb crystals\" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion. The motion of the ions in these crystals is strongly coupled, and the eigenmodes of motion all involve multiple ions. While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $\u03bc$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u63a7\u79bb\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u7684\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u79bb\u5b50\u7684 trap \u52bfential \u6765\u64cd\u63a7\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u5b50\u95f4\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff08phonon\uff09\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79bb\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86 Berry \u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5176\u975eadiabatic \u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u64cd\u63a7\u79bb\u5b50\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u64cd\u63a7\u79bb\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our main observation confirms that the radiative process depends distinctively on the initial configuration in which the probes are arranged, as well as on the direction of the probe velocity. We also extend our analysis to a thermal environment, thereby simulating a more realistic background. We thoroughly discuss the effects due to different switchings, the thermal background, and probe motion on the radiative process of these tripartite entangled probes.

However, the requirement for tunable and low-noise laser sources considerably increases the cost and the size of the system, thereby limiting the industrial applicability of the microresonator-based technology. Here, we explore the possibility of using a low-cost fixed-frequency semiconductor laser as the pump laser to perform radiofrequency electrometry. A resonant mode in a lithium niobate microresonator is frequency-locked to the laser using the electrooptic effect. This same effect also underlies the radiofrequency electric-field sensing mechanism. Our experimental results show that the electrometry resolution can be maintained at signal frequencies beyond the optical resonance bandwidth and that the signal-to-noise ratio does not change with varied coupling conditions as long as the laser frequency noise is the dominant noise source of the system. In addition, narrowband electrooptic sensitivity enhancement is observed at frequencies of the microresonator's piezoelectric resonances, resulting in a resolution enhancement factor of approximately 3 at signal frequencies around 4 MHz.

Building on the HBAR framework of Scully and collaborators, we analyze two detector realizations: a charged-monopole current coupling and a physical electric-dipole coupling, both within a cavity that isolates a single outgoing Schwarzschild mode prepared in the Boulware state. Using a near-horizon stationary-phase analysis, we show that the thermal detailed-balance factor governing excitation versus absorption is universal and depends only on the near-horizon Rindler coordinate transformation. At the same time, the absolute spectra acquire distinctive Proca signatures: a hard mass threshold, polarization-dependent prefactors, and axial/polar greybody transmissions. Promoting single-pass probabilities to escaping rates yields a master equation whose steady state is geometric and whose entropy flux obeys an HBAR-style area-entropy relation identical in form to the scalar case, with all vector-field specifics entering through the radiative area change.

By reconstructing complex fields at two illumination wavelengths and exploiting their phase difference, the method achieves an effective synthetic wavelength lambda_s and an unambiguous range of lambda_s/2 without reducing lateral resolution. A noise-robust wrapped-number search is used to select per-pixel integer pairs (k1, k2), and a global refinement with circular TV regularization and soft bounds improves stability and preserves height discontinuities. The approach is validated through rigorous scattering-model-based simulations and experiments on structured silicon samples, demonstrating accurate height recovery in regimes where single-wavelength FPT exhibits phase wrapping.

They act as ideal probes for exploring the non-perturbative structure of the theory. Rigid surface operators are a specific class of surface operators characterized by the absence of continuous deformation parameters. It is expected that a closed $S$-duality map should exist among these rigid operators. While progress has been made on specific examples or subclasses by leveraging invariants and empirical conjectures, a complete picture remains elusive.\n  A significant challenge arises when multiple rigid surface operators share identical invariants, making the determination of $S$-duality relations difficult. More critically, a mismatch exists in the number of rigid surface operators between dual theories when classified by invariants; this is referred to as the \\textit{mismatch problem}. This discrepancy suggests the necessity of extending the scope of consideration beyond strictly rigid operators.\n  In this paper, we propose a direct, natural, and precise $S$-duality map for rigid surface operators.\n  Our map is realized by moving the longest row in the pair of partitions defining a surface operator from one factor to the other, with an additional box appended or deleted to balance the total number of boxes.\n  This mapping naturally incorporates non-rigid surface operators, thereby resolving the mismatch problem. The proposed map is applicable to gauge groups of all ranks and clarifies several long-standing puzzles in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "Authors propose a precise S-duality map for rigid surface operators by modifying their partition structure.", "motivation": "Surface operators in gauge theories are studied, focusing on S-duality and their structure.", "method": "Authors consider partition pairs defining surface operators and propose a specific transformation for S-duality.", "result": "The proposed map resolves the mismatch problem by incorporating non-rigid operators.", "conclusion": "This provides a comprehensive solution for S-duality in surface operators."}}

While the mathematical theory underpinning quantum correlations between spacelike separated systems has been well-established since the 1930s, the mathematical theory for correlations between non-spacelike separated systems is much less developed. In this work, we develop the theory of what we refer to as \"local-density operators\", which we view as joint states for possibly non-spacelike separated quantum systems. Local-density operators are unit trace operators whose marginals are genuine density operators, which we show not only subsumes the notion of density operator, but also several extensions of the notion of density operator into the spatiotemporal domain, such as pseudo-density operators and quantum states over time. More importantly, we prove a result which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between local-density operators and what we refer to as \"Dirac measures\", which are complex-valued measures on the space of separable projectors associated with two quantum systems. In the case that one of the systems is the trivial quantum system with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, our result recovers the fundamental result known as Gleason's Theorem, which implies that the Born rule from quantum theory is the only way in which one may assign probabilities to the outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems in a non-contextual manner. As such, our results establish a direct generalization of Gleason's Theorem to measurements performed on possibly non-spacelike separated systems, thus extending the mathematical theory of quantum correlations across space to quantum correlations across space and time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This makes the essence of the strong-$CP$ puzzle very transparent and offers a solution in form of the gauge axion, which has exact quality. This axion represents an intrinsic part of the QCD gauge redundancy without any reference to an anomalous global symmetry. It is a two-form transforming under the QCD gauge symmetry. Due to its pure gauge nature, the gauge axion represents a powerful tool to monitor physics of $\u03b8$-vacua in various regimes. Unlike the ordinary Peccei-Quinn axion, which is UV-completed into a Goldstone phase of a complex scalar and thereby suffers from the quality problem, the gauge axion is UV-completed directly into a fundamental theory of gravity. We study the domain wall and string structure of the gauge axion and show that the strings sourcing it must be a part of this fundamental theory.

This framework allows us to introduce information-theoretic measures that quantify the correlations between the system and the memory. Furthermore, we develop a general framework to characterize the statistics of the memory -- such as moments, cumulants, and correlation functions -- which can be applied both to general feedback-control protocols and to monitored systems without feedback. As an application, we analyze feedback schemes based on detection events in a two-level system coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on protocols that stabilize either the excited-state population or Rabi oscillations against thermal dissipation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u51fd\u6570\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5b50\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u548c memories\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u9010\u6e10\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u53cd\u9988\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This work goes beyond the point-like idealisation and considers a sphere of finite radius. We find that the vanishing of the linear response coefficients ceases as they acquire a correction due to the finite size of the object. This introduces a hierarchy between the even and odd multipoles of the response coefficients determined by the separation of scales between the radius of the sphere and the screening scale of non-linearities.

We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces.

Double homodyne detection provides a powerful method for the direct measurement of the Husimi Q quasi-probability distribution, offering a complete state representation in a simple experimental setting and a limited time frame. Here, we demonstrate that double homodyne detection can serve as more than a passive measurement apparatus. By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured. The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter : the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state.

In our setup, matter follows stable circular orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), while inside the ISCO, it rapidly plunges into the black hole. We begin by analyzing the orbital dynamics of massive and massless particles around the black hole. Our results indicate that as the non-minimal coupling parameter increases, the radii of both the ISCO and the photon sphere, together with the corresponding energy and angular momentum for massive particles or the impact parameter for photons, decrease approximately linearly. Moreover, compared with the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes, the non-minimal coupling extends the range of the impact parameter and slightly enhances the redshift effect in the images. Additionally, due to the significant influence of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the event horizon, the observed intensity of the non-minimally coupled black hole image under the selected emission model ultimately turns out to be weaker than that of the other two types of black holes, regardless of the inclination angle between the accretion disk and observation planes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u7535\u4e2d\u6027\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u8584\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5149\u6e90\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5185\u4fa7\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\uff08ISCO\uff09\u548c\u5149\u7403\u534a\u5f84\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u5ef6\u4f38\u5149\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7a0d\u5fae\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea2\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7531\u4e8e\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u89c6\u754c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u4f1a\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f31\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u5982\u4f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u5468\u56f4\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u5149\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cISCO\u548c\u5149\u7403\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u7ebf\u6027\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4e5f\u76f8\u5e94\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u5ef6\u5c55\u4e86\u5149\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7a0d\u5fae\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7ea2\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u90fd\u4f1a\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u663e\u8457\u7684\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5176\u5149\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}

The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u4f53\u78c1omechanical\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u78c1omechanical\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u975eHermitian\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u4f20\u9012\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5fae\u7eb3\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u4f53\u548c\u78c1omechanical\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u8154\u4f53\u78c1omechanical\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u975eHermitian\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Hermitian regime\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u6210\u5355\u7a97\u53e3\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u975eHermitian regime\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5438\u6536\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236\u5149-\u78c1\u548c\u78c1omechanical\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8c03\u8282\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u4f53\u78c1omechanical\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1omechanical\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u975eHermitian\u6548\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u611f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

As the number of qubits increases, the probability density sharply concentrates around the maximally mixed state, making nearly pure coarse-grained states increasingly unlikely. For two qubits, we also compute the inverse state needed to characterize the effective dynamics under coarse-graining and find that the average preimage of the maximally mixed state contains a finite singlet component.

The protocol is highly scalable for models with local interactions and is in principle insensitive to state-preparation errors. At its core, the protocol forms a linear system of equations for the model parameters in terms of a set of observable values and their gradients. The required gradient information is obtained by fitting time-series data with sums of exponentially damped sinusoids and differentiating those curves. We develop a robust curve-fitting procedure that finds the most parsimonious representation of the data up to shot noise. We demonstrate the approach by learning the Lindbladian for a full layer of gates on a 156-qubit superconducting quantum processor, providing the first learning experiment of this kind. We study the effects of state-preparation and measurement errors and limitations on the operations that can be learned. For improved performance under readout errors, we propose an optional fine-tuning strategy that improves the fit between the time-evolved model and the measured data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8 Lindblad \u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u6c42\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u6c42\u5bfc\u83b7\u5f97\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u539f\u7406\u4e0a\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u5236\u5907\u8bef\u5dee\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728 156 \u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u9519\u8bef\u4ee5\u53ca\u64cd\u4f5c\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u8bfb\u51fa\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684 Lindblad \u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u6c42\u5bfc\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u6b63\u5f26\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u66f2\u7ebf\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 156 \u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5355\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684 Lindbladian \u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5373\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5236\u5907\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u4ee5\u53ca\u64cd\u4f5c\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The dependence of the quasinormal spectrum on $a$ is moderate for the fundamental modes and even weaker for the overtones, which approach one another in the complex-frequency plane as the halo parameter increases. No enhancement or rapid growth of overtone amplitudes is observed, indicating that the halo does not induce the type of strong near-horizon effects characteristic of quantum-corrected or exotic compact objects.

In these protocols, pre-shared entanglement enables either the faithful transfer of quantum states or the transmission of more information than is possible classically. However, channel losses degrade the shared states, reducing teleportation fidelity and the information advantage in superdense coding. Here, we investigate how to mitigate these effects by optimising the measurements applied by the communicating parties. We formulate the problem as an optimisation over general positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) and compare the results with physically realisable noiseless attenuation (NA) and noiseless linear amplification (NLA) circuits. For teleportation, NLA/NA and optimised POVMs improve the average fidelity by up to 78% while maintaining feasible success probabilities. For superdense coding, they enhance the quantum advantage over the classical channel capacity by more than 100% in some regimes and shift the break-even point, thereby extending the tolerable range of losses. Notably, the optimal POVMs effectively reduce to NA or NLA, showing that simple, experimentally accessible operations already capture the essential performance gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While there has been a shift from viewing open systems solely as a source of error to treating them as a computational resource, their programmability remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a framework that characterizes and quantifies the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups by combining physically implementable retrieval maps with time varying program states. Within this framework, we identify quantum programmable classes enabled by symmetry and stochastic structure, including covariant semigroups and fully dissipative Pauli Lindbladians with finite program dimension. We further provide a necessary condition for physical programmability that rules out coherent generators and typical dissipators generating amplitude damping. For such nonphysically programmable cases, we construct explicit protocols with finite resources. Finally, we introduce an operational programming cost, defined via the number of samples required to program the Lindbladian, and establish its core structural properties, such as continuity and faithfulness. These results provide a notion of programming cost for Lindbladians, bridge programmable channel theory and open system dynamics, and yield symmetry driven compression schemes and actionable resource estimates for semigroup simulation and control in noisy quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups and establishes a framework for quantifying and characterizing this property in quantum systems.", "motivation": "Understanding how to program open quantum systems for controlled functionality in noisy environments is crucial for advancing quantum technologies.", "method": "Mathematical analysis and theoretical framework development, combined with consideration of symmetry and stochastic structures.", "result": "A unified framework for assessing programmability of Lindbladian semigroups, demonstrating conditions for physical programmability, and providing resource estimates for control tasks.", "conclusion": "This framework enhances our ability to harness open systems as computational resources, supporting practical quantum control in noisy environments."}}

A central challenge today is to understand the behavior of complex quantum many-body systems, where interactions play an essential role. About four decades ago, Richard Feynman proposed using controllable quantum systems to efficiently simulate complex physics and chemistry problems, envisioning quantum orreries, highly tunable quantum devices built to emulate less understood quantum systems. Here we ask whether quantum simulators have already uncovered new physical phenomena-and, if so, in which areas and with what impact. We find that, in several notable instances, they have advanced our understanding of many-body quantum dynamics. Although many of these insights could in principle have been obtained theoretically or numerically, they were nevertheless first achieved using quantum processors. While a broad landscape of problems beyond non-equilibrium dynamics still awaits exploration, it is encouraging that quantum simulators are already beginning to challenge and refine our conventional wisdom.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quantum simulators have already enhanced our understanding of many-body quantum dynamics by delivering insights that theoretical and numerical methods could not achieve.

For such communication, itinerant microwave photons propagating through transmission lines offer a promising approach. However, demonstrations to date have relied on frequency-tunable circuit elements to compensate for fabrication-related parameter variations between sender and receiver devices, introducing control complexity and limiting scalability. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips. To compensate for the sender-receiver mismatch, we employ a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique which enables us to adjust the photon frequency without modifying circuit parameters. To enhance the frequency tunability, we implement broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators, achieving a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz. This broadband design enables successful quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies between the remote qubits.

In the continuous-variable regime, non-Gaussian entangled resources have been shown theoretically to improve teleportation fidelity compared to Gaussian squeezed vacuum. We experimentally demonstrate a heralded two-mode resource state for non-Gaussian teleportation capable of real-time use. We characterize this state with two-mode homodyne tomography showing it has fidelity $F=0.973\\pm 0.005$ with the expected resource state. Real-time use is enabled by a photon-subtraction orchestrator system performing live coincidence detection and outputting low-jitter and low-latency heralding signals. Live collection of real-time quadrature measurements of photon-subtracted states is enabled by the development of a synchronized homodyne detection server where the orchestrator system queries to collect the real-time quadrature samples corresponding to the heralded state. These results demonstrate significant advancement in enabling the use of heralded non-Gaussian states in quantum networking protocols, especially in the context of quantum repeaters, non-Gaussian quantum sensing and measurement-based quantum computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d teleportation \u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u8d44\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5384\u5c14\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u4e0e\u8282\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8be5\u4e3b\u9898\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u62bd\u6837\u7684\u5384\u5c14\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4f4e\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684 herald\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u540c\u76f8\u68c0\u6d4b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6536\u96c6\u88ab\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u7ec4\u6001\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u540c\u76f8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u540c\u76f8\u7406\u60f3\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bda\u5b9e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u5fc3\u7075\u611f\u5e94\u5668\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u540c\u76f8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u540c\u6b65\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u540c\u76f8 Heart\u5e94\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c150\u4e2a\u540c\u76f8\u667a\u80fd\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de7\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8be5\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8697%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7eaf\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

In this paper, we reformulate the unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solve it via the Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) method. To overcome the difficulty that generic RGA updates do not, in general, correspond to physically implementable quantum operators, we introduce Grover-compatible retractions to restrict RGA updates to valid oracle and diffusion operators. Theoretically, we establish a local Riemannian $\u03bc$-Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) inequality with $\u03bc= \\tfrac{1}{2}$, which yields a linear convergence rate of $1 - \u03ba^{-1}$ toward the global solution. Here, the condition number $\u03ba= L_{\\mathrm{Rie}} / \u03bc$, where $L_{\\mathrm{Rie}}$ denotes the Riemannian Lipschitz constant of the gradient. Taking into account both the geometry of the unitary manifold and the special structure of the cost function, we show that $L_{\\mathrm{Rie}} = O(\\sqrt{N})$ for problem size $N = 2^n$. Consequently, the resulting iteration complexity is $O(\\sqrt{N} \\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ for attaining an $\\varepsilon$-accurate solution, which matches the quadratic speedup of $O(\\sqrt{N})$ achieved by Grover's algorithm.

Its non-Gaussian resources, essential for outperforming any classical system, are provided by single-photon inputs and click detection. Yet the drive toward larger experiments has led to the replacement of experimentally demanding single-photon sources with Gaussian states, thereby diminishing the available non-Gaussianity-a critical quantum resource. As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states.\n  To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run. This architecture enables direct, side-by-side benchmarking of distinct sampling regimes under otherwise identical conditions. By employing a semi-device-independent framework, offering certification that does not rely on prior knowledge of the interferometer or the input states, we verify that the observed data cannot be reproduced by any classical model-a prerequisite for demonstrating quantum advantage.

Yet their generation remains fundamentally constrained: in the absence of intrinsic photon-photon interactions, the generation of such states is inherently probabilistic rather than deterministic. The prevalent technique of post-selection verifies the creation of an entangled state by detecting and thus destroying it. Heralding offers a solution in which measuring ancillary photons in auxiliary modes signals the state generation without the need to measure it. Here, we report an experiment to generate a three-mode two-photon NOON state, where the detection of a single photon in one heralding mode signifies the presence of the state in three target modes. We validate the generated state by estimating a fidelity of 0.823 +/- 0.018 with respect to an ideal three-mode NOON state and certifying genuine multipartite entanglement. By virtue of the high success probability and small resource overhead of our scheme, our work provides a theoretical and experimental stepping stone for entangled multi-mode state generation, which is realizable with current technology. These multi-mode entangled states represent a key direction for linear optical quantum information that is complementary to multi-qubit state encoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u51fa\u4e8e Quantum \u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8d85\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u2018\u7b5b\u9009\u2019\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4Hong-Ou-Mandel\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a \u043c\u043e dal/photon\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f photon-photon\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e24\u4e2a photon\u7684 NOON \u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u7eed\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5355 photon\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u786e\u8ba4\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e24\u4e2a photon \u7684 NOON \u6001\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5173\u8054\u5ea6\u4e3a 0.823 \u00b1 0.018\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u8be5\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6001\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u9762\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e24\u4e2a photon \u7684 NOON \u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u8c31\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u8c31\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a qubit \u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e92\u8865\u3002"}}

We offer a structural explanation from minimal constraints on finite descriptions of admissible histories. Assume that histories admit finite, self-delimiting (prefix-free) generative codes that can be decoded sequentially in a single forward pass. These purely syntactic requirements define a minimal descriptive cost, interpretable as a smoothed minimal program length, that is additive over local segments. First, any continuous local additive cost whose stationary sector coincides with the empirically identified classical variational sector is forced into a unique Euler--Lagrange equivalence class. Hence the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptional structure alone, while the specific microscopic Lagrangian and couplings remain system-dependent semantic input. Second, independently of microscopic stochasticity, finite prefix-free languages exhibit exponential redundancy: many distinct programs encode the same coarse history, and this redundancy induces a universal exponential multiplicity weight on histories. Requiring this weight to be real and bounded below selects a real Euclidean representative for stable local bosonic systems, yielding the standard Euclidean path-integral form. When Osterwalder--Schrader reflection positivity holds, the Euclidean measure reconstructs a unitary Lorentzian amplitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Starting from a correlated thermal equilibrium state between the particle and bath, we prove that this correspondence is exact for quadratic potentials under arbitrary quantum state preparations of the particle itself. For more general, smooth potentials, we identify and exploit a natural small parameter: the density matrix becomes strongly quasidiagonal in the coordinate representation, with its off-diagonal width shrinking as the bath's spectral cutoff increases, providing a controlled parameter for accurate approximation. The framework is fully general: arbitrary initial quantum states-including highly non-classical superpositions-are incorporated via their Wigner functions, which serve as statistical weights for trajectory ensembles.

This class encompasses not only standard uniformly controlled gates (UCGs) but also a wide range of circuits with uniformly controlled structures. However, their circuit-depth and gate-count complexities have not been systematically analyzed within a unified framework. In this work, we study the general decomposition problem for UCG and UCG-like structure. We then introduce the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group that models the controlled gate set. This model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit uniformly controlled gates, and diagonal unitaries. Furthermore, this model also naturally incorporates k-sparse version (k-rUCGs), where only a subset of control qubits participate in each multi-qubit gate. Building on this algebraic model, we develop a general framework. For an n-control rUCG, the framework reduce the gate complexity from ${O(n2^n)}$ to ${O(2^n})$ and the circuit depth from ${O(2^n\\log n)}$ to ${O(2^n\\log n/n)}$. The framework further provides systematic size and depth bounds for k-rUCGs by exploiting sparsity in the control space, with same optimization coefficient as rUCG, respectively. Empirical evaluations on representative QAOA circuits and quantum state preparation both confirm reductions in depth and size. Crucially, these results highlight that the rUCG model and its associated decomposition framework unify circuits previously considered structurally distinct under a single, asymptotically optimal synthesis paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recently, this framework is extended to characterize quantum phase transitions in arXiv:2509.20258 by introducing the concepts of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros. Here, we generalize the theory by studying a broad class of quantum models, including the XY model, the XXZ model, the XYZ model, and the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model in one dimension, subject to complex external magnetic field. For the XY, XXZ and XYZ models, we find that the complex field breaks parity symmetry and induces oscillations of the ground state between the two parity sectors, giving rise to fidelity zeros within the ordered phases. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, the complex field splits the real part of the ground-state energy between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sectors ($q=1,2$), while preserving the degeneracy within the charged sector. Fidelity zeros arise only after projecting out one of the charged sectors, and the finite-size scaling of these zeros produces critical exponents fully consistent with analytical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To understand this emergent non-Markovianity, we define a Markovianity condition appropriate to logical gate operations, and study it by relating logical operations to their physical implementation (operations on the data qubits into which the logical qubit is encoded). We apply our analysis to small quantum codes, and show that they exhibit non-Markovian dynamics even for very simple physical noise models. We show that non-Markovianity can emerge from Markovian physical operations if (and only if) the physical qubits are not necessarily returned to the code subspace after every round of QEC. In this situation, the syndrome qubits can act as a memory, mediating time correlations and enabling violation of the Markov condition. We quantify the emergent non-Markovianity in simple examples, and propose sufficient conditions for reliable use of gate-based characterization techniques like gate set tomography in early fault-tolerant quantum devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7269\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u662f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7684\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u903b\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5176\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u6570\u636e\u4f4d\u4e0a\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7269\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53\u7269\u7406\u4f4d\u5728\u6bcf\u8f6e\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u540e\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u88ab\u5f3a\u5236\u8fd4\u56de\u4ee3\u7801\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u4f1a\u4ece\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7269\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u4f4d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u8f6c\u79fb\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95e8\u8def\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u95e8\u8def\u96c6\u6001\u56fe\uff09\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u5bb9\u5fcd\u91cf\u5b50\u88c5\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6f14\u5316\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u95e8\u8def\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u903b\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5176\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5e76\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u7136\u8fd4\u56de\u4ee3\u7801\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7269\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u8fd4\u56de\u4ee3\u7801\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u4f4d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ecb\u8d28\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8f6c\u79fb\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002regularization\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7801\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u95e8\u8def\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u8def\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u5fc5\u8981\u8fd4\u56de\u4ee3\u7801\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u95e8\u8def\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "It is a well-known fact in classical information theory that no deterministic procedure can extract close-to-ideal randomness from an arbitrary entropy source. On the other hand, if additional knowledge about the source is available -- e.g., that it is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials -- then deterministic extractors do exist. For quantum entropy sources, where in addition to classical random variables we consider quantum side information, the use of extra knowledge about their structure was pioneered in a recent publication [C. Foreman and L. Masanes, Quantum 9, 1654 (2025)]. In that work, the authors provide deterministic extractors for device-independent randomness generation with memoryless devices achieving a sufficiently high CHSH score. In this work, we extend their construction to the prepare-and-measure scenario. Specifically, we prove that the considered functions are also extractors for memoryless devices in a semi-device-independent setting under an overlap assumption on the prepared quantum states. We then simulate the resulting randomness generation protocol on a novel and experimentally relevant family of behaviors, observing positive key rates already for $7\\times 10^3$ rounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a method for deterministic randomness extraction from memoryless quantum devices using a semi-device-independent approach, achieving significant key rates already in early rounds of operation.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this work is to improve the efficiency and applicability of quantum randomness generation protocols, particularly in experimental settings where additional assumptions may not always hold.", "method": "The authors extend a previously introduced construction for device-independent randomness generation, adapting it to a prepare-and-measure scenario.

Classical methods like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) exhibit variable performance across noise models and suffer from polynomial complexity, while tensor network decoders achieve high accuracy but at prohibitively high computational cost. Recent neural decoders reduce complexity but lack the accuracy needed to compete with computationally expensive classical methods. We introduce SAQ-Decoder, a unified framework combining transformer-based learning with constraint aware post-processing that achieves both near Maximum Likelihood (ML) accuracy and linear computational scalability with respect to the syndrome size. Our approach combines a dual-stream transformer architecture that processes syndromes and logical information with asymmetric attention patterns, and a novel differentiable logical loss that directly optimizes Logical Error Rates (LER) through smooth approximations over finite fields. SAQ-Decoder achieves near-optimal performance, with error thresholds of 10.99% (independent noise) and 18.6% (depolarizing noise) on toric codes that approach the ML bounds of 11.0% and 18.9% while outperforming existing neural and classical baselines in accuracy, complexity, and parameter efficiency.
