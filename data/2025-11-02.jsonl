In this paper,\nwe have established the first dedicated data analysis pipeline for the\nanisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background using a joint network of\nTianQin, LISA, and Taiji. Our analysis incorporates both Gaussian, stationary,\nand unpolarized point sources from diverse sky locations as well as a random\nsky map. We have performed full-sky map reconstruction in pixel space using\nmaximum likelihood estimation to extract the angular distribution of the SGWB.\nThe results demonstrate that, when considering the detector noise, the\nTianQin+LISA+Taiji detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum\nof the stochastic background up to a maximum multipole moment of $l = 14 $,\nwhich can provide valuable information for studies on the spatial distribution\nof galactic compact binaries and physical imprints from the early Universe."}

We define a\nscalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the\ntotal variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann\ndistribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random\ncouplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through\ntransfer-matrix methods.

Here we perform a non-perturbative circuit analysis in terms\nof dressed transmission-line modes for representative resonant coupling\ncircuits, going beyond the weak-coupling treatment. The strong frequency\ndependence of the resulting coupling coefficients implies that the Markov\napproximation commonly employed in cQED analysis is inadequate.

This coherent light-matter\ninteraction imprints the internal dynamics of the medium onto the\ninterferometer output, yielding phase-sensitive interference that enables\nindirect readout of terahertz-band signal modes via near-infrared detection.\nThe results reveal a route toward entanglement-assisted terahertz sensing and\nestablish a general framework for treating nonlinear quantum media as active\ncomponents in interferometric architectures."}

The most\nintriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair\nformed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point\nout the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,\ndubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\\nu=-2-x$, there is a\ntwo-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a\npaired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,\nwhile additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to\nan intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative\nLuttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a\nrenormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal\nstate of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL\nphase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the\nsFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.\nInterestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal\n$p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified\ntheory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap\nnematic superconductivity below it."}

Such\nsimulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical\nto advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and\nmaterials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to\nclean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of\nall previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods,\nand it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale\nquantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we\nimplement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System\nModel H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit\nsystem that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the\nperiodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge\nseparation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the\nlimited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical\nsimulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum\ndevice. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the\neffective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between\ncharge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by\nclassical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum\ncomputing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the\ncapacity of classical computing."}

On a\npragmatic front, it has gained significant importance as researchers worldwide\nactively engage in the study on quantum networks. However, as typical to any\nquantum resource, network nonlocality is also vulnerable to environmental\nnoise, which sometimes prove to be detrimental. Environmental interactions are\nmodeled in terms of quantum channels. In the present study, we introduce and\ncharacterize network nonlocality breaking channels. Network nonlocality\nbreaking channels model environmental influences which results in the loss of\nresource, i.e., the system loses its nonlocal resource due to such\ninteractions. The study is done in the ambit of some suitably chosen\ninequalities in (i) linear networks and (ii) star-shaped networks. Further, the\nloss in full network nonlocality is also studied. Furthermore, we also\ncharacterize quantum channels according to their ability in preserving quantum\nresources, i.e., they do not break network nonlocality, which enables one to\nidentify useful quantum channels in networks. The study is vindicated by\nillustrations from various noise models like depolarizing and dephasing\nchannels."}
