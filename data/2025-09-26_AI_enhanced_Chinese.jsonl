A significant development in this\ndirection has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital\nangular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent\nferromagnet, and has motivated the search for \\textit{orbitronic} materials\ndisplaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect\n(OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We\ndemonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the\nbulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by\nfour orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of\nthe Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while\nincorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study\nconstitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system\nwith \\textit{inversion symmetry}. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an\nideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the\nspin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our\nresults provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic\ndevices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u81a8\u80c0\n\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728 THIS Work \u4e2d\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684 \u57fa\u4e8e\u9517\u7684 \u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740 memories \u548c\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u9517\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7 Luttinger \u6a21\u578b\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f68\u9053\u78c1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u8fd1\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u9517\u4e2d\u672c\u5f81\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9517\u8fd9\u79cd\u5177\u6709 inversion \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u6750\u6599\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9517\u4e2d\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c4 Topological Insulators \u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6563\u5c04\u6001\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9517\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5c5e\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u7535\u5bfc\u6027\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u9517\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u9517\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

We investigate the response of gapless\nsingular flat bands to inhomogeneous fluxes, bridging continuum and lattice\ndescriptions. Our analysis reveals a mechanism to controllably manipulate the\nanomalous Landau levels via flux inhomogeneity. We further uncover an emergent\nsupersymmetry in the parameter space where the tower of anomalous Landau levels\ncollapses to zero energy, rendering a lattice analog of the Aharonov-Casher\ntheorem on degenerate zero modes in perpendicular fluxes, with wavefunction\nlocalization partly similar to Aharonov-Bohm caging.

These systems support complex dynamical\nmagnetic excitations, where interlayer coupling gives rise to both in-phase\n(acoustic) and anti-phase (optical) magnonic modes. Typically, simultaneous\nexcitation of both modes requires breaking the symmetry between the\nferromagnetic layers -- commonly achieved through slight misalignment of the\nexperimental setup or by modifying the intrinsic magnetic properties. In our\napproach, we utilize a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet (pSAF), where one of\nthe ferromagnetic layers is exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnet. We\ndemonstrate that by tuning the thickness of the antiferromagnet and slightly\nenhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer, both acoustic and\noptical modes can be efficiently excited -- without the need for experimental\nmisalignment or changes to the intrinsic material properties.

Single-tone experiments demonstrate a net line rate of 400\nGbps per polarization (16-QAM, 120 GBd) in silicon within the O-band, achieving\na record shoreline density of 4 Tbps/mm while consuming only 10 fJ/bit for\nmodulation.

We address this for the simplest known case among gapless SPTs\nprotected by a unitary symmetry group acting faithfully on the low-energy\ntheory.

The\nhysteresis is often reported with attributes like \"negligible\" or \"small\"\nwithout giving any specifics as to how this was determined and against what\nreference the measured values were compared to. Quite surprisingly, there\nappears to be only a fragmentary understanding of the mechanisms actually\ncontributing to hysteresis and the sensitivity of the actual measurement on\nvarious experimental parameters. We attempt to close this gap by first\nproviding a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the dominant mechanisms\ncontributing to hysteresis: charge trapping by defects from the channel or the\ngate, the drift of mobile charges, and eventually ferroelectricity. We continue\nby suggesting methods to experimentally distinguishing between these phenomena.\nBased on these discussions it becomes clear that previously reported hysteresis\nvalues have little meaning as they have been non-systematically recorded under\narbitrary conditions. In order to resolve this predicament, we propose a\nstandardized hysteresis measurement scheme to establish the hysteresis as a\ncomparable metric for the assessment of device stability. Our standardized\nscheme ensures that hysteresis data can be effectively compared across\ndifferent technologies and, most importantly, provide a means to extrapolate\ndata obtained on thicker prototypes to subnanometer equivalent oxide\nthicknesses. This facilitates the systematic benchmarking of insulator/channel\ncombinations in terms of stability, which thereby enables the screening of\nmaterial systems for more stable and reliable 2D-material-based MOSFETs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In contrary,\nstudy on the topological properties of the asymmetric systems is rather\nlimited, especially in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we explore a\nnew theory to study the topology in various one-dimensional (1D) and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) asymmetric systems with chiral boundary states. Starting\nfrom the simple SSHm model, we show the chiral topology of its edge states by\nredefining sublattices. Meanwhile, based on its Rice-Mele-like effective\nHamiltonian, a new topological invariant $\\bar{Z}$ can be defined and the\nbulk-edge correspondence is established. With this clear physical picture, our\ntheory can be extended to the more complex asymmetric ladder models, or even\nthe 2D asymmetric systems. In the 2D BBH3 model, new chiral corner states with\nredefined lattices are found based on our method. These corner states are\nindependent of any spatial symmetry and exhibit the characteristics of\ntopological bound states in the continuum (TBICs). Moreover, the topological\ninvariant can be calculated by introducing $\\bar{Z}$ into 2D.

At the\nboundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a\ncrossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address\nfinite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study\nthe trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations.

In analogy with\nthe classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic\nsynchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state\ndensity matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics.

The researchers further linked the secular orbital phase to the relativistic anomaly and the eccentric correction to the precession advances, which are key components in current models for binary black hole mergers.", "motivation": "Understanding the dynamics of binary black hole mergers, particularly those involving significant orbital eccentricity, remains a critical challenge in gravitational wave astronomy. Accurate models of these systems are essential for interpreting signals detected by gravitational wave observatories and for advancing our understanding of relativistic astrophysics.", "method": "This study employs a combination of numerical simulations and a data-driven framework called gwMiner. Singular value decomposition and signal processing techniques are used to extract eccentric harmonics from numerical relativity simulations of eccentric, aligned-spin waveforms for various spherical harmonic modes. The researchers then analyze these harmonics to derive phase and frequency expressions.", "result": "The primary findings of the study reveal that the phase of each eccentric harmonic in the merger waveforms can be expressed as a combination of a secular orbital phase $\text{j}\text{\u03d5}_{\text{\u2113},\text{m},\text{\u03bb}} + \text{\u03d5}_{\text{\u2113},\text{m},\text{e}}$, where the secular orbital phase $\text{\u03d5}_{\text{\u2113},\text{m},\text{\u03bb}}$ is consistent across different spherical harmonic modes, and the eccentric correction $\text{\u03d5}_{\text{\u2113},\text{m},\text{e}}$ scales with $\text{\u2113}$. The eccentric correction term is not only dependent on the eccentricity but also linked to precession advances, which are critical parameters in modeling these systems. These results provide a more detailed understanding of the waveform structure of eccentric black hole binaries and can inform the development of more accurate models for gravitational wave signal analysis.", "conclusion": "This work advances our understanding of the waveform morphology of eccentric binary black hole mergers by decomposing the signal into eccentric harmonics. The findings demonstrate that the phase evolution of these harmonics incorporates both secular orbital evolution and eccentricity-dependent precession advances. This decomposition provides a more nuanced framework for modeling and analyzing gravitational wave signals from eccentric binary systems, which is crucial for improving the sensitivity and accuracy of gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo, as well as for advancing theoretical models in relativistic astrophysics."}}

By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices\nand representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and\ntheir gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces.\nWe construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\\ell_1$\ncodes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain\nnew families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with\nthe code length $N$ by constructing $\\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial\npatterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This\nimproves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces.

We first establish a\nset of physical design principles, showing that recurrent dynamics are optimal\nfor structural data (MNIST), whereas high mode-mixing is superior for textural\ndata (FMNIST). By treating turbulence-induced wavefront distortion as a complex\ntextural feature, we configure a physically optimised reservoir for classifying\norbital angular momentum (OAM) modes.

Such a quantum\npath selection can be achieved for the whole harmonic plateau, which has great\npotential to generate ultrashort isolated attosecond pulse with duration less\nthan one atomic unit of time.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper demonstrates that using squeezed light in high-order harmonic generation (HHG) can control the long and short quantum paths, enabling ultrashort attosecond pulses for applications in attosecond metrology.", "motivation": "Attosecond metrology is a rapidly advancing field that requires precise and ultrafast measurement tools. High-order harmonic generation (HHG) is a promising tabletop source for attosecond pulse generation, but controlling its quantum paths to achieve isolated pulses is a significant challenge. This paper addresses that challenge by introducing squeezed light as a means to control quantum paths in HHG.", "method": "The researchers used theoretical modeling and experiments with both coherent and squeezed laser fields. They derived the intensity-dependent amplitudes and phases of the harmonic pulses. The experiments used characterization techniques including pulse spectroscopy and timing analysis.", "result": "The study shows that squeezing the lasers monitored the quantum interference of electrons, leading to suppression of one quantum path and suppression of the other for extended harmonic plateaus. The single-photon interference patterns in attosecond pulses from HHG were successfully enabled at up to 800 nm wavelength. The suppression of one quantum path over an extended plateau opens new avenues for detailed quantitative modeling of individual harmonic orders and for ultrafast pulse engineering.", "conclusion": "This work establishes a new level of control over the quantum paths in HHG, which is a major breakthrough in attosecond metrology. The ability to compare quantum states of light and their interference opens new possibilities for isolated attosecond pulse generation and ultrafast time-resolved studies."}}

This principle has been\nwidely adopted to make grating spectrometers more compact.

Thinned to the single layer phase, 2D-TMDs are unique solid-state\nsystems with excitonic states able to persist at room temperature and\ndemonstrate notable tunability of their energies in the optical range. Based on\nthese properties, they offer important opportunities for hybrid nanophotonic\nsystems where a nanophotonic structure serves to enhance the light-matter\ninteraction in the 2D-TMDs, while the 2D-TMDs can provide various active\nfunctionalities, thereby dramatically enhancing the scope of nanophotonic\nstructures. In this work, we combine 2D-TMD materials with resonant photonic\nnanostructures, namely, metasurfaces composed of high-index dielectric\nnanoparticles. The dependence of the excitonic states on charge carrier density\nin 2D-TMDs leads to an amplitude modulation of the corresponding optical\ntransitions upon changes of the Fermi level, and thereby to changes of the\ncoupling strength between the 2D-TMDs and resonant modes of the photonic\nnanostructure.

However, simulating such system on\nclassical computers is highly challenging due to nonlinear interactions, large\nstate spaces, and the exponential scaling of memory and computational\nresources. In this work, quantum simulation is employed to model a quantum\nanharmonic oscillator (QAHO) using a 3-qubit system implemented on IBM's\nQuantum Experiences platform. A quantum circuit with a filter-based design and\nToffoli gates is constructed to track quantum state evolution, capturing key\nphenomena like quantum revival. The framework is further extended to n-qubit\nsystem to enhance resolution and scalability. For energy estimation, the\nVariational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a TwoLocal ansatz and variational\nQuantum Deflation (VQD), are used to compute ground and excited state energies.\nThe proposed approach achieves high accuracy with an error of only 1.11%\ncompared to exact methods. Notably, VQE outperforms classical approximations\nsuch as perturbation theory (error 6.71%) and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin\n(WKB) approximation(error 5.36%), yielding more precise energy values. These\nresults highlight the potential of quantum simulation and VQD as effective\ntools for investigating complex quantum system, paving the way for future\napplication in quantum chemistry and materials science as quantum hardware\ncontinues to advance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
