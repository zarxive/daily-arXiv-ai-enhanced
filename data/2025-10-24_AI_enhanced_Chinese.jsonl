The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric,\neven-parity quasinormal mode with $\\ell=2$, $m=0$ and complex frequency\n$\\omega$. Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while\nkeeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent\nline-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a\nstatic observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic\nexpansion yields the familiar weak-field $1/b$ law with a ringdown-frequency\ncorrection that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere\nexpansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic\nstrong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small\noscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the\nbackground static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities like centroid\nmotion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, and photon-ring morphology are\ngauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing\nthat the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius\nmodulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field\ncorrection.

Biomolecular condensates formed by\nliquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been shown to buffer concentration\nfluctuations, but the principles governing their dynamic regulation remain\nunclear. We address this by probing the response of LLPS to oscillatory\nperturbations that mimic fluctuations across different timescales, establishing\nthe first systematic frequency-domain analysis of concentration buffering by\ncondensates.

This equivalence is not approximate or analogical\nbut mathematically identical to first order in $U/v$, sharing the same form\ndiscovered by Fresnel in 1818 for light in moving transparent media. We\ndemonstrate that all three systems-bubble acoustics, optical drag, and\nrelativistic velocity addition-are described by a universal partial entrainment\nequation where wave coupling to compliant components determines the drag\ncoefficient. In bubbly liquids this physics is directly observable: waves\ncouple to compressible bubbles rather than rigid liquid. Since bubble dynamics\nreproduces the relativistic result, velocity addition itself admits mechanical\ninterpretation. Von Laue's 1907 derivation abstracted mechanics into\nkinematics; we reverse this, showing relativistic effects preserve mechanical\ncontent in abstract form. Beyond first-order equivalence, we show Fresnel's\ndispersive term encodes group velocity (energy transport) versus phase velocity\n(wave-crest motion)-a distinction mechanical models naturally capture but pure\nkinematic velocity addition cannot address. The rigidity-based interpretation\nof dispersion, established in acoustic metamaterials, provides cross-domain\ninsights for materials design and suggests testable predictions linking\nacoustic compliance to optical drag. This three-way equivalence reduces\nindependent phenomena to a single principle: waves riding compliant inclusions.\nFresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization all emerge as\naspects of this one mechanism, traced through the historical\ndensity-versus-rigidity fork that shaped aether theory's trajectory.

This method is\nemployed to numerically solve the ordinary differential equation emerging from\nthe linearization of the associated nonlinear differential equation. In the\nfirst algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018),\nwhile in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs\net al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient\nconditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is\nindispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an\nefficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.\n  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of\nO(d$\\cdot$log(d)+T$\\cdot$polylog(T/$\\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the\nCarleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\\varepsilon$ is the\napproximation error.

Therefore, they have significant application prospects in\nthe fields of measurement, optical communication and micro-particle\nmanipulation. However, when fractional-order vortex beams propagate in free\nspace, the discontinuity of the helical phase makes them susceptible to\ndiffraction in practical applications, thereby affecting the accuracy of OAM\nmode recognition and severely limiting the use of FOAM-based optical\ncommunication. Achieving machine learning recognition of fractional-order\nvortex beams under diffraction conditions is currently an urgent and unreported\nissue. Based on ResNet, a deep learning (DL) method of accurately recognizing\nthe propagation distance and topological charge of fractional-order vortex beam\ndiffraction process is proposed in this work. Utilizing both experimentally\nmeasured and numerically simulated intensity distributions, a dataset of vortex\nbeam diffraction intensity patterns in atmospheric turbulence environments is\ncreated. An improved 101-layer ResNet structure based on transfer learning is\nemployed to achieve accurate and efficient recognition of the FOAM model at\ndifferent propagation distances. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod can accurately recognize FOAM modes with a propagation distance of 100\ncm, a spacing of 5 cm, and a mode spacing of 0.1 under turbulent conditions,\nwith an accuracy of 99.69%. This method considers the effect of atmospheric\nturbulence during spatial transmission, allowing the recognition scheme to\nachieve high accuracy even in special environments.

Our primary tool is the finite system density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan\nand fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and\nlengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact\ndiagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on\nthe edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra\ndegeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to\nstudy the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of\nflux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences\nbetween the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength\nscans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a\nbond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also\nextract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH\nside, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter\nand transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are\nconsistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain\nexcited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a\ncharge neutral momentum $\\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the\ndimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but\ngaps to other excitations remain large.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u683c\u5b50\u970d\u592bstadter-\u54c8\u5e03\u5df4\u7279\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\uff08IQH\uff09\u76f8\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u8272\u6563\u4f53\uff08CSL\uff09\u76f8\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\uff08DMRG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u5de7\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u7684\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528DMRG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u626b\u63cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5468\u957f\u4e0b\uff083\u30015\u30017\uff09\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u6cd5\u548c\u78c1\u901a\u63d2\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "IQH\u76f8\u548cCSL\u76f8\u7684\u660e\u663e\u533a\u522b\u8868\u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u8c31\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4ee5\u53ca\u7535\u8377\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u6cf5\u6d41\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u6807\u5ea6\u6570\u636e collapse\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u79e9\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8054\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u53d1\u6563\u7279\u6027\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e1+1\u7ef4\u4f0a sing\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u7535\u8377\u4e2d\u6027\u52a8\u91cf\u03c0\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u95ed\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u683c\u5b50\u970d\u592bstadter-\u54c8\u5e03\u5df4\u7279\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6bcf site one\u4e14\u78c1\u573a\u5bf9\u5e94\u56db\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0cIQH\u76f8\u4e0eCSL\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f0a sing\u578b\u4e8c\u7ef4\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u540c\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u6709\u5173\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u8be6\u7ec6\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u4f53\u7cfb\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

At the moment, they serve as a probe to test general relativity at\nastrophysical scales, but in the future they may also give us information about\ngravity at the microscale. Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties,\nsuch as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering\nblack holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in\nstatistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system,\nseveral questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be\nexplained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these\nquestions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored\nat the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this\nconnection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved\nspacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged\nself-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of\nstate which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black\nhole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach\nto quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes\nand self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase\ntransitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the\nformalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes.\nNamely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black\nholes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius.

In contrast, non-Hermitian systems exhibit complex band\nstructures where both energy and momentum have imaginary parts, underpinning\nphenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence that defy conventional Bloch theory. Experimentally mapping\nthese complex bands-relating complex momentum to complex energy-and identifying\ntheir associated eigenstates is crucial for understanding these systems but\nremains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a non-Bloch supercell\nframework designed to overcome this challenge by decoupling Bloch phase control\nfrom the imaginary part of momentum. Our method combines an exponent-flattening\nprotocol with twisted boundary conditions, enabling system-size-independent\ncontrol of imaginary momentum while preserving high-resolution Bloch phase\nsampling. Implemented in programmable one- and two-dimensional acoustic\ncrystals, our approach acquires momentum-resolved complex energy surfaces and\nbiorthogonal eigenmodes by Green's function measurements.Data obtained using\nthis framework accurately predict open-boundary spectra and eigenstates,\nfindings we verify through separate open-geometry experiments.

This observation strongly\nsuggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface\nthat crosses the event horizon.

In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single\ncoherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a\nsuperposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a\nhorizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum\nmacroscopic object.

We begin by setting the detuning\n(delta) - the frequency offset between the qubit transition and the driving\nfield - to zero and varying Omega from low to high values, eventually reaching\nthe vibrational frequency. Using quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the\ndensity matrix and track its evolution to assess non-Markovianity, revealing\nsignificant memory effects governed by the interplay between internal and\nmotional degrees of freedom. Furthermore, by exploring the dynamics across\nvarious parameter pairs (Omega, delta), we find that non-Markovianity does not\nalways increase monotonically with Omega for a fixed delta. Strikingly, when\nthe condition delta squared plus Omega squared equals nu squared is met, the\nnon-Markovianity exhibits a circular pattern of maxima. At this parameter\ncombination, the system's Hamiltonian takes a form similar to the\nJaynes-Cummings model, enabling the possibility of analytical insights into the\nobserved dynamics.

Based on the recent work (PRB {\\bf 111}, 024501 (2025)) on\nthe detection sensitive limit of the usual equilibrium JTD, here we numerically\ndemonstrate that a non-equilibrium JTD can be alternatively utilized to\nimplement the higher sensitive detection of a weak microwave signal, arriving\nat its energy quantum limit. In the presence of thermal noise, we numerically\nsimulate the phase dynamics for the CBJJ in the JTD with the different sweep\nrates of the biased currents, and find that the SCDs of the JTD with and\nwithout the microwave signal input show different behaviors. It is demonstrated\nthat, depending on how high the sweep rate of the biased current being applied,\nthe JTD can be operated in either the equilibrium- or the non-equilibrium\nstate.

The core contribution\nis a novel recursive algorithm to construct an effective time-dependent\ngenerator that is polynomial in the time variable, ensuring accuracy for short\ntime scales. The derivation is based on the Taylor expansion of the exponential\nmap and a new result for computing the time-ordered exponential of polynomial\ngenerators. This work is motivated by the challenge of deriving\ntime-convolutionless master equations in quantum physics and the proposed\nmethod offers an alternative to typical derivations based on expansions in the\ncoupling strength. The resulting approximation is accurate for small times,\ndoes not require a weak-coupling assumption, performs better than a truncation\nof the exponential map at low orders, and crucially, guarantees a completely\npositive and trace-preserving map at the lowest orders. The proposed method is\nvalidated against several prototypical models: a dephasing spin-boson model, a\ncentral spin model, and an Ising spin chain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5927\u578b\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u5e8f\u6307\u6570\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8026pling\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u6027\u548c\u8ff9\u5b88\u6052\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u5377\u79ef \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u968f\u673a\u76f8\u4f4d\u7387\u548c\u591a\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f31\u8026pling\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u6709\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8026pling\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u5e8f\u6307\u6570\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6784\u9020\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5f31\u8026pling\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6838-spin\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3spin\u6a21\u578b\u548cIsing\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u548c\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9002\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5f31\u8026pling\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However, its practical implementation is hampered by two\nmajor challenges: the expansive cost of sampling from quantum circuits and the\nreliance on unrealistic assumptions, such as gate-independent noise. Here, we\nintroduce Classical Noise Inversion (CNI), a framework that fundamentally\nbypasses these crucial limitations and is well-suited for various quantum\napplications. CNI effectively inverts the accumulated noise entirely during\nclassical post-processing, thereby eliminating the need for costly quantum\ncircuit sampling and remaining effective under the realistic condition of\ngate-dependent noise. Apart from CNI, we introduce noise compression, which\ngroups noise components with equivalent effects on measurement outcomes,\nachieving the optimal overhead for error mitigation. We integrate CNI with the\nframework of shadow estimation to create a robust protocol for learning quantum\nproperties under general noise. Our analysis and numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that this approach substantially reduces statistical variance while\nproviding unbiased estimates in practical situations where previous methods\nfail.

A principled and\nuniversally applicable approach to defining and identifying nonclassicality is\ngiven by the notion of generalized noncontextuality. Here, we study the\ntypicality of contextuality -- namely, the likelihood that randomly chosen\nquantum preparations and measurements produce nonclassical statistics. Using\nnumerical linear programs to test for the existence of a\ngeneralized-noncontextual model, we find that contextuality is fairly common:\neven in experiments with only a modest number of random preparations and\nmeasurements, contextuality arises with probability over 99%. We also show that\nwhile typicality of contextuality decreases as the purity (sharpness) of the\npreparations (measurements) decreases, this dependence is not especially\npronounced, so contextuality is fairly typical even in settings with realistic\nnoise. Finally, we show that although nonzero contextuality is quite typical,\nquantitatively high degrees of contextuality are not as typical, and so large\nquantum advantages (like for parity-oblivious multiplexing, which we take as a\ncase study) are not as typical. We provide an open-source toolbox that outputs\nthe typicality of contextuality as a function of tunable parameters (such as\nlower and upper bounds on purity and other constraints on states and\nmeasurements). This toolbox can inform the design of experiments that achieve\nthe desired typicality of contextuality for specified experimental constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8cPurple\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u51c6\u5907\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u51fa\u73b0\u975eclassical\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e7f\u4e49\u975econtextual\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u51c6\u5907\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d85\u8fc799%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u662f\u5728\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\uff08\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u4e5f\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u53ea\u4f1a\u7565\u5fae\u524a\u5f31\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u67d0\u79cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u975e\u5f88\u5178\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u8f83\u597d\u5178\u578b\u6027\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u5178\u578b\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7eaf\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u9650\u548c\u4e0a\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u51c6\u5907\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u975eclassical\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6982\u7387\u4e5f\u76f8\u5f53\u9ad8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e7f\u4e49\u975econtextual\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u5178\u578b\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6982\u7387\u4e5f\u572899%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u60c5\u51b5\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u800c\u81f3\u5c11\u5b58\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9ad8\u5178\u578b\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u5219\u975e\u5e38\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,\nedit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.\nWithin this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates\nthe problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics\ninto rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and\nthe induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with\nnondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\\in\\{2,3,4\\}$ and $n\\le6$ qubits,\nsystematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic\nlogical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$\nat $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring\nstructures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities\nfor all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue\ndegeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal\ncontrolled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts\ndiagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,\ncombining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction.

Comments welcome", "summary": "The problem of quantum state classification asks how accurately one can\nidentify an unknown quantum state that is promised to be drawn from a known set\nof pure states. In this work, we introduce the notion of $k$-learnability,\nwhich captures the ability to identify the correct state using at most $k$\nguesses, with zero error. We show that deciding whether a given family of\nstates is $k$-learnable can be solved via semidefinite programming. When there\nare $n$ states, we present polynomial-time (in $n$) algorithms for determining\n$k$-learnability for two cases: when $k$ is a fixed constant or the dimension\nof the states is a fixed constant. When both $k$ and the dimension of the\nstates are part of the input, we prove that there exist succinct certificates\nplacing the problem in NP, and we establish NP-hardness by a reduction from the\nclassical $k$-clique problem. Together, our findings delineate the boundary\nbetween efficiently solvable and intractable instances of quantum state\nclassification in the perfect (zero-error) regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u6700\u591ak\u6b21\u731c\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u5df2\u77e5\u7eaf\u6001\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86k-\u53ef\u5b66\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5224\u5b9a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6001\u65cf\u662f\u5426k-\u53ef\u5b66\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f53\u6001\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u4e3an\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\uff08n\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u5b9ak-\u53ef\u5b66\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5728k\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e38\u6570\u6216\u6001\u7ef4\u6570\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u3002\u5f53k\u548c\u6001\u7ef4\u6570\u90fd\u662f\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728NP\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7k-clique\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7ea6\u7b80\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86NP\u96be\u6027\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff08\u65e0\u8bef\uff09\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6f14\u793a\u6587\u7a3f\u5236\u5907\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86k-\u53ef\u5b66\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5f53k\u6216\u6001\u7ef4\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5f53\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u53d8\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u5230k-clique\u95ee\u9898\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684NP\u96be\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5b8c\u7f8e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cNP\u96be\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In our method, feature\nrelevance-measured via mutual information with the target-is encoded as local\ndetuning amplitudes, while feature redundancy is embedded through\ndistance-dependent van der Waals interactions, constrained by the Rydberg\nblockade radius. The system is evolved adiabatically toward low-energy\nconfigurations, and the resulting measurement bitstrings are used to extract\nphysically consistent subsets of features. The protocol is evaluated through\nsimulations on three benchmark binary classification datasets: Adult Income,\nBank Marketing, and Telco Churn. Compared to classical methods such as mutual\ninformation ranking and Boruta, combined with XGBoost and Random Forest\nclassifiers, our quantum-computing approach achieves competitive or superior\nperformance. In particular, for compact subsets of 2-5 features, analog QFS\nimproves mean AUC scores by 1.5-2.3% while reducing the number of features by\n75-84%, offering interpretable, low-redundancy solutions. These results\ndemonstrate that programmable Rydberg arrays offer a viable platform for\nintelligent feature selection with practical relevance in machine learning\npipelines, capable of transforming computational quantum advantage into\nindustrial quantum usefulness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u548c vampires \u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7adiabatic\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7adiabatic\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u9ad8\u80fd\u6001 configurations \u6f14\u5316\u5230\u4f4e\u80fd\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
