After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate.\n  FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature.\n  Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy. Extrapolating these we predict the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy.

Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches.

Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage.

By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u5355\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fde\u63a5\u56fe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5148\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u8fde\u63a5\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u79cd\u8111\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u53d7\u6d3b\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7535\u8def\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8111\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u79cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u53d1\u80b2\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5355\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u79cd\u7269\u79cd\uff08C. elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila, zebrafish, \u548c mouse\uff09\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u548c\u6743\u91cd/\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8111\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u52a0\u5165\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u8fde\u63a5\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u79cd\u8111\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u53d7\u6d3b\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7535\u8def\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5148\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u8fde\u63a5\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u53d1\u80b2\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u79cd\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This strategy, known as stochastic resetting, is well studied in random processes. Here, we introduce chaotic resetting, a fundamentally different resetting strategy designed for deterministic chaotic systems. Unlike stochastic resetting, where randomness is intrinsic to the dynamics, chaotic resetting exploits the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions inherent to chaotic motion: unavoidable uncertainties in the reset conditions effectively generate new realizations of the deterministic process. This extension is nontrivial because some realizations may significantly speed up the search, while others may significantly slow it down. We study the conditions required for chaotic resetting to be consistently advantageous, concluding that it requires the presence of a mixed phase space in which fractal and smooth regions coexist. We quantify its effectiveness by demonstrating substantial reductions in average search times when an optimal resetting interval is used. These results establish a clear conceptual bridge between deterministic chaos and search optimization, opening new avenues for accelerating processes in real-world chaotic systems where perfect control or knowledge of initial conditions is unattainable.", "AI": {"tldr": " Chaotic Resetting can accelerate deterministic chaotic systems through phase space mixing, and this approach avoids the limitations of fixed or random restarting strategies.", "motivation": " The paper aims to show how deterministic chaos can be harnessed to accelerate processes through a novel restarting mechanism.", "method": " The authors analyze chaotic systems, identify regions with fractal and smooth dynamics, and theoretically evaluate how these properties facilitate effective restarting.", "result": " When an optimal resetting interval is applied, the average search time decreases, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.", "conclusion": " Chaotic resetting is a promising approach for optimizing processes in systems where controlling initial conditions is not possible, providing a bridge between chaos theory and search optimization."}}

Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The construction is motivated by an $E_6\\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\\rightarrow SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{Y'}\\rightarrow U(1)_{\\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $\u0394S_{\\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(\u03be\\,\\ell_{\\rm dS})$ with $\u03be={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit.

For photons with standard (Dirichlet) boundary conditions, we analyze charged scalars whose boundary conditions break the $U(1)$ symmetry. This leads to a nonstandard Higgs mechanism in which the gauge field acquires a one-loop mass without a classical vacuum expectation value. Using recent advances in perturbation theory in AdS, we compute this mass explicitly and evaluate charged-scalar four-point functions. We also provide an alternative derivation based on boundary Ward identities. For photons with alternate (Neumann) boundary conditions, where local charged operators are not gauge invariant, we construct physical observables by dressing charged fields with geodesic Wilson lines. These dressed operators have well-behaved conformal properties and unphysical photon modes decouple from their correlation functions. Explicit one-loop computations further reveal the decoupling of boundary field strengths, for which we provide a nonperturbative argument based on higher-form symmetry. Along the way, we explain the physical consequences of spontaneous breaking of higher-form symmetry in AdS, including the role of the tilt operator, the relation between one-form symmetry and endpoints of Wilson lines at the boundary, and a generalized-symmetry interpretation of conserved currents dual to bulk gauge fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We first elucidate the geometric origin of equilibrium magnetization in the modern theory of magnetization, then discuss the role of quantum geometry in kinetic magnetization, and finally outline promising future directions at the frontier of quantum geometric magnetization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u78c1\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7535\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u5de8\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u78c1\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u79d1\u6280\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5728Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u78c1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u5de8\u78c1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u52a8\u80fd\u78c1\u6027\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Here we present the first end-to-end differentiable optimization framework for geometric waveguide that couples non-sequential Monte Carlo polarization ray tracing with a differentiable transfer-matrix thin-film solver. A differentiable Monte Carlo ray tracer avoids the exponential growth of deterministic ray splitting while enabling gradients backpropagation from eyebox metrics to design parameters. With memory-saving strategies, we optimize more than one thousand layer-thickness parameters and billions of non-sequential ray-surface intersections on a single multi-GPU workstation. Automated layer pruning is achieved by starting from over-parameterized stacks and driving redundant layers to zero thickness under discrete manufacturability constraints, effectively performing topology optimization to discover optimal coating structures. On a representative design, starting from random initialization within thickness bounds, our method increases light efficiency from 4.1\\% to 33.5\\% and improves eyebox and FoV uniformity by $\\sim$17$\\times$ and $\\sim$11$\\times$, respectively. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the waveguide and an image preprocessing network to improve perceived image quality.

Through the strategic adjustment of the input admittance, the conductance of the low-power diode decreases progressively with increasing power, while the conductance of the high-power diode increases correspondingly.

Original Work", "summary": "Image Phase Alignment Super-sampling (ImPASS) is a computational method for combining displaced low-resolution images into a single high-resolution image. The general steps include measuring the relative displacements, up-sampling, aligning and combining the images, followed by a blind deconvolution. Previous ImPASS studies have shown that the resulting image resolution can significantly subceed the diffraction limit of the imaging system. Characteristics that potentially limit the processed image resolution include optical parameters, detector noise, image alignment accuracy, or deconvolution parameters. In this report, modifications have been made to the algorithm to improve the image alignment accuracy and deconvolution. Applications of the modified algorithm improved image resolution by a factor up to 1.81. Compared to the original image resolution, the modified ImPASS achieved a resolution improvement factor up to 4.41 while subceeding the diffraction limit by a factor of 2.57. This suggests that limitations imposed by the physical properties of the system have not yet been reached, and further improvement of the algorithm is warranted.", "AI": {"tldr": "Modified ImPASS improves image resolution up to 4.41\u00d7, exceeds diffraction limit by 2.57\u00d7.", "motivation": "The method focuses on enhancing super-resolution through computational techniques, showing significant gains, suggesting potential for further advancements.", "method": "Accurate image alignment and blind deconvolution improve resolution beyond physical limits, achieving up to 4.41\u00d7 improvements.", "result": "Improved resolution of up to 4.41\u00d7, surpassing the diffraction limit by 2.57\u00d7.", "conclusion": "Enhanced algorithm enables surpassing physical resolution limits, with potential for further improvement."}}

We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(\u03b3H^{2}+\u03b4\\dot{H})^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $\u03b1$ (L\u00e9vy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the L\u00e9vy's index in the allowed range $1<\u03b1\\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires L\u00e9vy's index to be $\u03b1>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\\sim(\u03b3H^{2}+g(H))^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff.

To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface.

Theoretical and experimental investigations are actively progressing to provide the capability of efficient switching and precise control of the N\u00e9el vector, which is crucial for the intended practical applications of antiferromagnets. Recently, a time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory has been successfully developed to study the sublattice magnetization switching in anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets [K. Bolsmann $et \\, al.$, \\textcolor{blue}{\\hyperlink{10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030332}{PRX Quantum $\\mathbf{4}$, 030332 (2023)}}]. Here we use a complementary exact diagonalization method to study such sublattice magnetization switching, but in small-cluster quantum antiferromagnets, by means of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, this article aims to support the findings of the Schwinger boson approach. We show that the results of both approaches are consistent at short time scales, with only about 12.5 $\\%$ deviations. The consistency of the outcomes obtained through this alternative exact approach demonstrates that the time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory is a versatile framework to capture the essentials of the switching process in quantum antiferromagnets.

Although a perfectly flat band cannot exist in a continuous system, a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in a Zeeman lattice can realize the quasi-flat lowest band with an extremely narrow bandwidth. In such a quasi flat band, half vortex solitons become confined within a single lattice cell, enabling the formation of arrays of coupled half vortex solitons arranged of various spatial geometries. In this work, we study the existence and stability of these lattices within the framework of the two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that, near the quasi-flat band, half-vortex solitons and their arrays can be excited with a nearly negligible number of atoms and are constrained by their local symmetries, which are isomorphic to a dihedral group of order 8. This allows observation of the respective field patterns in the nearly linear regime where they exhibit enhanced stability.

In particular, the doubly spinning solution admits an extremal limit in which the entropy satisfies the relation S= 2 \u03c0J_\u03c6, thereby linking it directly to the angular momentum on the S^2.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we explore nonequilibrium phase transitions in a dissipative Rydberg system driven by a microwave (MW) field and demonstrate their critical sensitivity to high-precision MW sensing. Distinct dynamical regimes are identified, including monostable, bistable, and oscillatory phases under mean-field coupling. Unlike single-particle detection--where the beating signal decays linearly with MW field strength--the time crystalline phase exhibits high sensitivity to MW perturbations, with rapid, discontinuous frequency switching near the monostable-oscillatory boundary. The abrupt transition is rooted in spontaneous symmetry breaking in time and is fundamentally insensitive to the background noise. On this basis, a minimum detectable MW field strength on the order of 1nV/cm is achieved by leveraging this sensitivity. Our results establish a framework for controlling time crystalline phases with external fields and advance MW sensing through many-body effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u53d7\u9a71\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5fae\u6ce2\uff08MW\uff09\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u53d7\u9a71\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u5fae\u6ce2\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u5728\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5fae\u6ce2\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u9a71\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5212\u5206\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u6ce2\u573a\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u76f8\u53d8\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u963b\u5c3c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5212\u5206\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u3001\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u548c\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff1b2) \u53d1\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u5bf9\u5fae\u6ce2\u573a\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4e0e\u5355\u7a33\u6001\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\u5207\u6362\uff1b3) \u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a1\u7eb3\u4f0f\u7279/\u5398\u7c73\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5fae\u6ce2\u573a\u5728\u53d7\u9a71\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u6ce2\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u52a8\u6001 Many-body \u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5fae\u6ce2\u573a\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated", "summary": "In gyrotropic crystals, an oscillating magnetic field induces a charge response known as the gyrotropic magnetic current. While its conventional origin is attributed to magnetic field modified band energy and shift in the Fermi-surface, a recent study identified an additional spin-driven magnetic displacement contribution. Here, we complete the picture by identifying the orbital counterpart of the magnetic displacement current. Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity. Physically, this contribution arises from the time variation of the magnetic-field induced charge polarization. In the low frequency transport regime, this mechanism becomes purely intrinsic. We illustrate this intrinsic gyrotropic current of orbital origin in the ${\\cal P}{\\cal T}$-symmetric antiferromagnet CuMnAs.

The comb is generated using an extremely simple setup, composed of a continuous-wave (CW) fiber laser and a single-sideband phase modulator (SSM). Our approach delivers optical-to-radio-frequency conversion comparable to dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) but through a simplified self-heterodyning architecture. By leveraging the intrinsic mutual coherence of the comb, this design achieves a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient (NEA) of 5.0*10^(-6) Hz^(-1/2)--an order-of-magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art DCS, coupled with long-term stability. The system resolves weak molecular overtone spectra on nanosecond timescales, in a single-shot measurement, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 128.

It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f3a\u5f31\u5c40\u90e8\u52bf\u6270urbation\u5bf9\u590d\u632f\u8361\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8c31\u53d8\u5f62\u662f\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5171\u632f\u6cbf\u7279\u5b9a\u8def\u5f84\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u786c\u58c1\u6781\u9650\u70b9\uff0c\u5f31\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u632f\u8361\u8c31\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u661f\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u7406\u7684\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u5206\u6790\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Nariai\u548cSchwarzschildSpacetime\u7684\u6709\u754c\u52bf\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6270\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u8c31\u53d8\u5f62\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8STEM\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5438\u5f15/\u6392\u65a5\u70b9\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "ided the basic framework for analyzing resonance deformation under perturbation, highlighting nonlinear spectral stability issues when generalizing to strong perturbations."}}

The ensuing phases demonstrate that the minority component is being un-trapped, partially trapped, or fully trapped by the majority droplet species. These states are characterized by their binding energies captured by the chemical potentials and their low-amplitude excitation spectrum, including mode crossings at the particle-emission threshold.

Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \\pm \\hbar\u03c9$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters.

The magnetism of the Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ olivine is surprisingly complex, proceeding from commensurate states to a multiferroic commensurate + incommensurate phase. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results from a Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ single crystal and develop an effective Hamiltonian including long-distance bilinear and dipolar interactions. The magnetic interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic and span a three-dimensional exchange network consisting of coupled sawtooth chains.

We report two monolithically integrated silicon-photonic OEO converters-load-resistor (high-speed variant) and current-injection (high-gain variant) types-fabricated at a silicon photonics foundry. Each device combines a germanium photodetector with a micro-ring modulator (MRM). The converters exhibit reconfigurable nonlinear transfer functions and measurable on-chip RF OEO gain. The RF OEO gain scales linearly with the MRM bias power, with slopes of 0.10 mW^-1 (load-resistor of 10 k\u03a9) and 1.4 mW^-1 (current-injection), enabling a gain > 1 region at practical bias powers (~10 mW and ~1 mW, respectively). Eye diagrams confirm clear openings up to 4 Gb/s for a high-speed load-resistor variant with a 500-\u03a9 load. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a monolithically integrated, foundry-fabricated silicon-photonic load-resistor type OEO converter exhibiting reconfigurable nonlinear transfer and on-chip RF OEO gain. In the carrier-injection device, the activation slope exceeds unity, yielding 3.9 dB extinction-ratio regeneration. Short-pulse measurements yield 3-dB bandwidths of 1.49 GHz, 160 MHz (load-resistor of 500 \u03a9 and 10 k\u03a9), and 76 MHz (current-injection), consistent with the RF data. Energy analysis shows an energy-bandwidth trade-off (RC-limited for load-resistor vs. lifetime-limited for injection) and outline routes to sub-pJ/bit operation via reduced capacitance and improved EO efficiency.

By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9759\u6b62\u7684\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u3001\u5e26\u7535\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u683cavity\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728f(R)\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u6b27\u62c9-\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u4f7f\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\u53d1\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5149\u73af\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u7535\u8377\u548cfR0\u589e\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f71\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u7403\u4f4d\u4e8e\u89c6\u754c\u5916\u4e14\u5f71\u5b50\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5176\u5916\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b while\u7403\u53d8\u800c\u5f71\u5b50\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u968f\u7740\u7535\u8377\u548cfR0\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u5929 elites\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548cM87*\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e, Found the de Sitter Black hole\u89e3\u662f\u7b26\u5408\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u7684,\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0cFor AdS Black hole\u89e3\u5219\u5f53\u7535\u8377\u8f83\u4f4e\u4e14fR0 >-1\u65f6\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u8f90\u5c04\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684 electrostatic-charge\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u84b8\u53d1\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684 nonlinear\u7535\u78c1\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684fR0\u6291\u5236\u5176\u8f90\u5c04\u7387.", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u548cfR0\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684 shadows\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u4fe1\u53f7\u540e\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86 de Sitter \u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 f(R) \u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u6b27\u62c9-Heisenberg \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u5199\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We explain how non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can support eigenstates completely undetected by eigenvalues, with the unidirectional Hatano-Nelson model serving as both a minimal realization and universal paradigm for this phenomenon. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding. Our framework explains how the apparent bulk-edge correspondence failures in models like the non-Hermitian SSH chain instead reflect the systematic inability of the eigenvalue spectrum to detect certain eigenstates in systems with a skin-effect. These results establish the limitation of the eigenvalue spectrum and suggest how the eigenstate approach can lead to improved characterization of non-Hermitian topology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u8c31\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\uff1a\u672c\u5f81\u8c31\u548c\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u8c31\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u88ab\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e00\u7ef4\u54c8\u7279\u7eb3-\u5185\u6d77\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b83\u65e2\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c8\u662f\u901a\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u9610\u8ff0\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u9690\u85cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u5de8\u91cf hidden\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8272 Models\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u50cf\u975e\u5384\u7c73 SSH\u94fe\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d bulk-edge \u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5931\u6548\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u8c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u67d0\u4e9b\u672c\u5f81\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u672c\u5f81\u8c31\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730 Characterize\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u4e0e\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u5206\u6790\u54c8\u7279\u7eb3-\u5185\u6d77\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u85cf\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u548c\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u54c8\u7279\u7eb3-\u5185\u6d77\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u9690\u85cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5de8\u91cf\u9690\u85cf\u4f8b\u5916\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8272 Models\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u975e\u5384\u7c73 SSH\u94fe\u4e2d bulk-edge \u5931\u8d25\u53cd\u6620\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u67d0\u4e9b\u672c\u5f81\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u8c31\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6240\u6709\u672c\u5f81\u6001\uff0c\u5e94\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity, which is consistent with the cascade of electronic-topological transitions reported previously for this compound. In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76YbNi\u2084P\u2082\u5355\u6676\u5728\u6cbf[001]\u8f74\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5f39\u6027\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u58f0\u901f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u8be5\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7535\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7279\u522b\u6307\u51fa\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u5c0f\u8f68\u9053\u6d88\u901d\u4e0e34 T\u91cf\u5b50\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u58f0\u6ce2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684k\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u5f3a-correlated\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u5f39\u6027\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5728YbNi\u2084P\u2082\u6676\u683c\u6cbf[001]\u8f74\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50\u58f0\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u58f0\u901f\u5f02\u5e38\u53ca\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7535\u5b50\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b50\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u58f0\u901f\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u5c0f\u8f68\u9053\u6d88\u901d\uff0c\u5229\u7528k\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u58f0\u6ce2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u58f0\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7684\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u58f0\u6ce2\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86YbNi\u2084P\u2082\u4e2d\u58f0\u6ce2\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components. As we show, the proposed framework can work under different coherence conditions, and can be combined with existing control strategies, such as different wavelengths. Our results establish the illumination angular spectrum as a powerful degree of freedom for controlling diffractive networks, enabling a scalable and versatile framework for multi-task all-optical computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5165\u5c04\u5149\u89d2\u8c31\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u5149\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u5e72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5168\u5149\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u529f\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5165\u5c04\u5149\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u5149\u6805\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u7684\u89d2\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u6805\u548c\u5149\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u6570\u5b57\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u5b57\u6bcd\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u5168\u5149\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

We prove analytically in the transverse-field Ising (TFI) model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that every critical momentum $k^{*}$ associated with a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) saturates its entanglement entropy to the maximal value $\\ln{d}$ ($d=2$ in TFI and SSH models), coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. This saturation of mode entanglement thus provides a universal, direct signature of DQPTs.

A single quantum dot in a site-selected nanowire waveguide is a promising candidate for realizing such sources. However, such sources are associated with poor single-photon indistinguishability, limiting their applicability in quantum networks. A common approach for enhancing the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum dot-based entangled photon sources is to implement a broadband optical cavity. Achieving a high-Purcell cavity while retaining the advantages of the nanowire, such as directional emission, a broad operational bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency, has been a significant challenge.

Additionally, the lateral resolution of 2P microscopy is lower compared to linear one-photon (1P) fluorescence microscopy. Widefield 2P microscopy, using cameras, holds promise for reducing photo-toxicity while maintaining high image acquisition rates. Widefield imaging trades the high power and short integration times of sequential single point scanning for the low power and extended integration times of parallel detection across millions of pixels.

In this work, we introduce 2P Random Illumination Microscopy (2P-RIM), an easy-to-implement 2P widefield technique, that achieves low photo-damage, fast imaging, micrometric axial sectioning, and enhanced lateral resolution for arbitrarily large FOVs. By using widefield speckled illuminations in conjunction with an image standard deviation matching algorithm, 2P-RIM demonstrated multicolor imaging over FOVs greater than 200 um, lateral resolution 220 nm, axial sectioning 2 um, and peak excitation powers about 10 times lower than those used in focused laser scanning microscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "A paper about a new 2P microscopy technique 2P-RIM that allows micrometer axial sectioning in wide fields of view with low photodamage and high resolution.", "motivation": "Improving microscopy techniques for reduced photodamage and higher resolution.", "method": "Uses widefield speckled illumination and image standard deviation matching algorithm.", "result": "Achieved 2\u03bcm axial sectioning, 220nm lateral resolution, and reduced excitation powers by 10 times compared to focused microscopy.", "conclusion": "2P-RIM is an effective widefield 2P technique for micrometer imaging in large fields."}}

The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion.

For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper examines the entanglement negativity of a specific quantum field theory model, revealing how symmetries influence entanglement measures in regions with complex topology.", "motivation": "Understanding entanglement properties in complex spacetime geometries is crucial for testing quantum field theory predictions.", "method": "The study focuses on a two-dimensional free scalar chiral current model, analyzing entanglement measures for ground states across line and circular spacetimes with two intervals.", "result": "They derive analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose and logarithmic negativity, finding agreement with numerical lattice model results, and observe topological effects in small and large interval separations.", "conclusion": "This work bridges entanglement negativity and mutual information, showing shared topological features influenced by symmetries in quantum field theories with nontrivial topologies."}}

FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \\textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study.

These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u65f6\u9488\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u7eaf\u4e8c\u6b21\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u9762\u81ea\u65cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176Kerr-Schild\u548cGibbons-Hawking\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u5355\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u65f6\u9488\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5168\u7eaf\u4e8c\u6b21\u66f2\u9762\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u65cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176Kerr-Schild\u548cGibbons-Hawking\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u5355\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Beam splitters, a fundamental building block of photonic circuits, have recently been demonstrated in free space using geometric-phase optical elements. These devices coherently mix circularly-polarized transverse modes of freely-propagating optical fields, including modes carrying orbital angular momentum. In this work, we investigate liquid-crystal metagratings as electrically tunable beam splitters for transverse-momentum optical modes. By exploiting the voltage-controlled birefringence of liquid-crystal metasurfaces, we experimentally tune the splitting ratio of the device and thereby control the degree of two-photon interference between indistinguishable photons.

For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form.

Quantum technology can facilitate secure communication for cryptographic applications, combining QKD with one-time-pad (OTP) encryption. In order to ensure the continuous operation of QKD in real-world networks, efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the use of components and effective QKD protocols to improve secret key rates and increase the transmission between multiple users. Generally, in experimental implementations, the secret key rates are limited by single-photon detectors, which are used at the receivers of QKD and create a bottleneck due to their limited detection rates (detectors with low detection efficiency and high detector dead-time). We experimentally show that secret key rates can be increased by combining the time-bin information of two such detectors on the data line of the receiver for the coherent-one-way (COW) QKD protocol with a minimal increase in quantum bit error rate (QBER, the proportion of erroneous bits). Further, we implement a point-to-multipoint COW QKD protocol, introducing an additional receiver module. The three users (one transmitter and two receivers) share the secret key in post-processing, relying on OTP encryption. Typically, the dual-receiver extension can improve the combined secret key rates of the system; however, one has to optimise the experimental parameters to achieve this within security margins.

These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\u03c1_{\\rm vac}=\u03c1_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},\\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\u039b$). In the FLRW epoch, $\u03c1_{\\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\u039b\\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\u03b4\u03c1_{\\rm vac}\\sim {\\cal O}(m_{\\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$.

Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory.

Although many such materials appear similarly dark under diffuse illumination, their reflectance behavior can differ substantially as a function of viewing and lighting geometry. Ultra-black materials achieve exceptional light attenuation but are often constrained by cost and mechanical fragility, motivating the evaluation of more robust and accessible alternatives. In this study, we employ a gonimetric measurement system to capture the isotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution function of a range of black materials, including the ultra-black reference Vantablack, commercially available alternatives such as Musou Black and black velvet, and standard matte black coatings. We analyze their reflectance characteristics in terms of diffuse and specular scattering, as well as total integrated scatter, to quantify angular-dependent reflection. In addition, we compare their perceptual appearance using physically based rendering driven by the measured BRDFs and a psychophysical evaluation of perceived darkness.

We implement a Ramsey sequence that maps phonon-number-dependent phases onto the spin, thereby realizing a multimode spin-dependent rotation (SDR). We also introduce a selective-decoupling scheme that cancels the phase induced by the carrier AC-Stark shift while preserving the phonon-number-dependent phase induced by the dispersive shift.

Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and St\u00fcckelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase.

A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative.

In this work, the system under investigation consists of four particles arranged in a cyclic entanglement configuration, where each particle forms entangled pairs with two neighbors, while non-neighboring particles remain unentangled. We found that this entanglement structure offers a larger set of conditions that lead to the contradiction with the LHV model, compared to the fully entangled systems. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of multiple excluded states and correlations, in which the measurement result of a particle only influences the result of its paired partners. We implement quantum circuits compatible with the cyclic entanglement structure, and through simulation, the correlation patterns and the states of interest are identified. We further execute the proposed circuits on IBM Brisbane, a practical backend; however, the results show considerable deviations from the simulation counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Investigated cyclic entanglement in four-particle systems and found stronger nonlocality than fully entangled systems.", "motivation": "Understanding the structure of entanglement and nonlocality is crucial for quantum information processing.", "method": "Used cyclic entangled systems and quantum circuits to study nonlocality through simulation and experimental testing on IBM Brisbane.", "result": "Observed larger contradictions with local hidden variable models compared to fully entangled states.", "conclusion": "Cyclic entanglement structures enhance nonlocality, providing new insights into quantum mechanics applications."}}

Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C>1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout.

Standard regulators typically impose such suppressions by hand (e.g. cutoffs, higher-derivative terms, heat-kernel smearing, lattice discretizations), while here we show that closely related smooth filters can arise as the conditional map produced by interference in a coherently controlled, postselected superposition of evolutions. A successful postselection implements a single heralded operator that is a coherent linear combination of time-evolution operators. For a Gaussian superposition of time translations in quantum mechanics, the postselected step is $V_{\u03c3,\u0394t}=e^{-iH\u0394t}\\,e^{-\\frac12\u03c3^2\u0394t^2H^2}$, i.e.\\ the desired unitary step multiplied by a Gaussian energy filter suppressing energies above order $1/(\u03c3\u0394t)$. This renders short-time kernels in time-sliced path-integral approximations well behaved for singular potentials, while the target unitary dynamics is recovered as $\u03c3\\to0$ and (for fixed $\u03c3$) also as $\u0394t\\to0$ at fixed $t$. In scalar QFT, a local Gaussian smearing of the quartic coupling induces a positive $(\u03c3^2/2)\u03c6^8$ term in the Euclidean action, providing a symmetry-compatible large-field stabilizer; it is naturally viewed as an irrelevant operator whose effects can be renormalized at fixed $\u03c3$ (together with a conventional UV regulator) and removed by taking $\u03c3\\to0$.

However, classical computation of Pauli strings suffers from exponential complexity and quickly becomes a performance bottleneck as the number of qubits increases. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Pauli Composer Accelerator (PACOX), the first dedicated FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation. PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product.

In quantum chaotic systems, coherent errors arising from imperfect Hamiltonian control and incoherent errors induced by coupling to the environment are both exponentially amplified during time evolution due to information scrambling. A fundamental question is how these two classes of errors imprint distinct signatures on the emergent irreversibility of many-body dynamics. In this Letter, we address this question by investigating multi-round time-reversed dynamics in the presence of both coherent and incoherent errors. By applying scramblon theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Loschmidt echo over different rounds of time-reversed evolution. For incoherent errors, the error accumulates linearly with the number of rounds, whereas coherent errors exhibit a crossover from quadratic to linear accumulation. These predictions are explicitly verified using the solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

A mean temperature over the virtual temperatures of adjacent energy levels is defined to compare the passive states of the system resulting from isoenergetic and isoentropic transformations. The role of the minimum and the maximum (min-max) values of the virtual temperatures in determining the direction of heat flow between the system and the environment is argued based on majorization relations. We characterize the intermediate passive states in a quantum Otto engine using these virtual temperatures and derive an upper bound for the Otto efficiency that can be expressed in terms of the min-max virtual temperatures of the working medium. An explicit example of the coupled-spins system is worked out. Moreover, virtual temperatures serve to draw interesting parallels between the quantum thermodynamic processes and their classical counterparts.

While its feasibility has been widely demonstrated, existing implementations typically assume fixed or slowly drifting reference-frame misalignment, conditions rarely satisfied outside the laboratory. In realistic environments, rapid and free-running reference-frame variations can severely degrade both the key rate and transmission distance of conventional RFI-MDI-QKD. Here we propose a free-running RFI-MDI-QKD protocol that maintains high-rate key generation under rapid reference-frame variations. By introducing a classification-distillation method that reclassifies total detection events, secure keys can be extracted without modifying the experimental setup. Our protocol achieves a key rate more than nine times higher than the best previous RFI-MDI-QKD scheme and tolerates channel losses exceeding 24 dB, where earlier approaches fail.

Despite the widespread use of Purcell filters to suppress qubit decay and near-quantum-limited amplifiers, dispersive readout often lags behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate junction readout, a simple readout architecture that realizes a strong qubit-resonator cross-Kerr interaction without relying on a transverse coupling. This interaction is achieved by coupling a transmon qubit to its readout resonator through both a capacitance and a Josephson junction. By varying the qubit frequency, we show that this hybrid coupling provides intrinsic Purcell protection and enhanced resilience to MIST, enabling readout at high photon numbers. While junction readout is compatible with conventional linear measurement, in this work we exploit the nonlinear coupling to intentionally engineer a large Kerr nonlinearity in the resonator, enabling bifurcation-based readout. Using this approach, we achieve a 99.4 % assignment fidelity with a 68 ns integration time and a 98.4 % QND fidelity without an external Purcell filter or a near-quantum-limited amplifier.

In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame.

In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance.

However, frequency crowding in large-scale systems ultimately restricts the achievable frequency separation. While such XY coupling facilitates entangling gate operations, its residual presence poses a key challenge during single-qubit controls. Here, we propose a scalable pulse-level control framework, incorporating frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD), to suppress XY crosstalk errors.
