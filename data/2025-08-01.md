*Fabrice Roncoroni,Abrar Faiyad,Yichen Li,Tao Ye,Ashlie Martini,David Prendergast*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates ion adsorption at metal-electrolyte interfaces using enhanced simulations, comparing classical force fields with machine-learned potentials. They find that standard parameters can lead to incorrect ion adsorption predictions and develop a tuning method to improve this. Their framework, validated using UMA model, enhances understanding of ion-specific effects in electrochemical systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ion adsorption is vital for accurate modeling in electrochemistry, but challenges arise from parameterizing intermolecular forces. This paper aims to address those challenges by comparing classical and machine-learned models.

Method: The study uses enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with classical force fields and ML potentials. They focus on Au(111)-water interactions and Na+, Cl-, F- ions. The method involves metadynamics for ion adsorption profiles and a tuning method for LJ parameters to control adsorption energetics. They employ UMA MLIP as a surrogate for ab initio models.

Result: Classical models can lead to incorrect adsorption predictions unless cross-term LJ parameters are carefully tuned. UMA model validates classical trends and accurately simulates specific adsorption behaviors. Vulnerabilities in classical models are identified, offering a framework for integrating molecular adsorption into continuum models, enhancing electrochemical predictions.

Conclusion: The paper reveals the sensitivity of ion adsorption to force field parameterization and emphasizes the need for accurate interatomic potentials. It provides a methodology for improving modeling accuracy, especially in predicting ion-specific effects, and bridges molecular simulations with continuum models for better electrochemical system modeling.

Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is
essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we
systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and
F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular
dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic
potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong
dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters,
highlighting that --without due care-- standard mixing rules can lead to
qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a
systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control
adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate
for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for
Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific
adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific
adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical
expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into
continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion
adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential
of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results
underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced
interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at
electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular
simulations and continuum electrochemical models.

Abstract: It has recently been shown that configuration state functions (CSF) with
local orbitals can provide a compact reference state for low-spin open-shell
electronic structures, such as antiferromagnetic states. However, optimizing a
low-spin configuration using self-consistent field (SCF) theory has been a
long-standing challenge, since each orbital must be an eigenfunction of a
different Fock operator. Here, I introduce a low-spin restricted open-shell
Hartree-Fock (ROHF) algorithm to optimize any CSF at mean-field cost. This
algorithm employs quasi-Newton Riemannian optimization on the orbital
constraint manifold to provide robust convergence, extending the Geometric
Direct Minimization approach to open-shell electronic structures with arbitrary
genealogical spin coupling. Numerical calculations on transition metal aquo
complexes show improved convergence over existing methodology, and reveal the
potential for many local CSF energy minima in iron-sulfur complexes. Finally,
open-shell CSFs with different spin coupling patterns are used to qualitatively
study the singlet ground state in polyacenes, revealing the onset of
polyradical character for increasing chain length.

### [3] [Optimization of Fragment State Spaces within the Excitonic Renormalization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23484)
*Marco Bauer,Patrick Norman,Andreas Dreuw,Anthony D. Dutoi*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的激发性重正化框架，用于弱相互作用片段的电子结构理论。这种方法利用分立的轨道和相关态，在孤立片段上评估，然后利用双正交方法自洽地恢复相互作用。然而，该方法缺乏高效的元底优化过程，无法在不构建全片段态空间的情况下生成优化的模型态空间。作者提出了一个算法，利用分子的梯度和预筛选行列式空间来解决这个问题，展示了算法对保尔exemple二的性能良好。此外，该算法可以利用零阶模型态空间来准确恢复一级结果，从而大大提高了优化效率。论文补充了激发性重正化方法论，使其成为多标度可计算的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper presents an alternative approach to electronic structure theory, which is significant in the field of computational chemistry and materials science. The ability to handle weakly interacting fragments efficiently is a key focus, as excitation effects are crucial in many molecular systems. This new framework, based on excitonic renormalization, offers a promising methodological advancement, but requires efficient algorithms to deal with the computational challenges inherent in such methods. The introduction of an efficient algorithm for model state optimization bridges a critical gap in the method, making the overall framework more practical for application in chemical and materials modeling. This is of particular interest to researchers seeking innovative tools for studying complex systems where traditional methods may be too computationally intensive。

Method: The paper introduces a novel excitonic renormalization framework for electronic structure theory. The approach utilizes isolated fragments with absolutely localized orbitals and correlated states. A biorthogonal framework is applied to reconstruct interactions without building the full monomer state spaces. The core challenge addressed is the lack of an efficient procedure to generate optimized model state spaces. To tackle this, the authors propose an algorithm that leverages monomer gradients at different levels and a preprocessing step to screen the determinant space efficiently. By utilizing these techniques, the algorithm can construct compact model state spaces and manage intermediates effectively. Additionally, the optimization process benefits from the use of zeroth-order model state spaces to achieve accurate first-order results, significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

Result: The paper presents numerical results on the Be dimer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The model state spaces built using the algorithm closely resemble those of optimal model state spaces, achieving accurate results. Furthermore, it is shown that optimizing model state spaces at the zeroth order of the Hamiltonian expansion allows accurate recovery of first-order results, enabling efficient optimization. The numerical results validate the algorithm's capability to construct compact model state spaces efficiently, which is a crucial step towards realizing the full potential of the excitonic renormalization framework.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses a key limitation of the excitonic renormalization framework by introducing an efficient algorithm for model state optimization. This advancement makes the framework more scalable and practical for real-world applications. The algorithm, which utilizes monomer gradients and efficient determinant space preprocessing, enables the construction of compact model state spaces and efficiently optimizes them. The numerical results on the Be dimer demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, showing that optimized model state spaces at the zeroth-order expansion level can yield accurate first-order results. This work lays the groundwork for a polynomially scaling method that can handle complex systems with weak interactions efficiently, contributing to the field of electronic structure theory and enabling more precise modeling of molecular systems where excitations play a significant role.

Abstract: The recently proposed excitonic renormalization framework presents an
alternative ansatz to elec- tronic structure theory of weakly interacting
fragments. It makes use of absolutely localized orbitals and correlated states
evaluated on isolated fragments, which are then used to recover the interaction
in an ab-initio manner based on a biorthogonal framework. The correlated
monomer information can be heavily truncated, and the Hamiltonian can be
expanded in a rapidly converging series, allow- ing the Hamiltonian to be built
and diagonalized in a scalable fashion. However, the methodology still lacks an
efficient bottom-up procedure, capable of producing optimized model state
spaces for the isolated fragments, without ever building the Hamiltonian in the
full monomer state spaces. In order to address this issue, this work presents
an algorithm utilizing monomer gradients at three different levels as well as
an efficient pre-screening of the determinant space, ensuring compact model
state spaces and intermediates. Numerical results are presented for the
beryllium dimer, showing that the algorithm is indeed capable of building
compact model state spaces, yielding results that closely resemble those of the
optimal model state spaces. Furthermore, it is shown that model state spaces,
optimized at the zeroth order of the Hamiltonian expansion, can also be used to
accurately recover first order results, enabling very efficient optimization,
as the optimization can be conducted at a lower order than the targeted final
level. Hence, the presented solver completes the excitonic renormalization
methodology, forming a polynomially scaling framework.

Abstract: Accurate quantum mechanical treatment of molecular reactions remains a
longstanding challenge, especially for reactions involving deep potential wells
and long-lived intermediate complexes. Here, we introduce an interaction region
decoupling (IRD) strategy that incorporates structured absorbing potentials to
dynamically partition the interaction region into reactant and product
subspaces. The IRD framework integrates naturally with standard TDWP
propagation schemes and enables the construction of region-specific basis sets,
dramatically enhancing computational efficiency. Benchmark applications to the
F + HD and O + OH reactions demonstrate that this approach achieves
state-resolved accuracy while reducing computational cost by over two orders of
magnitude. This strategy paves the way for routine quantum mechanical treatment
of complex-forming four-atom reactions previously considered intractable.

Abstract: Synthesizing new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a challenging task, as
the size, morphology, polymorph and type and number of defects present on the
synthesis product may depend on many variables, including temperature, solvent,
concentration and nature of reactants, among others. A deeper understanding on
how synthesis conditions determine the obtained material is crucial to optimize
the use of resources when synthesizing new MOFs. In this contribution, we study
the impact of changing concentration, solvent and temperature on the molecular
level mechanisms of the solvothermal nucleation process of ZIF-8 relying on
molecular dynamics simulations using a force field that incorporates
metal-ligand reactivity. We find that the nucleation is faster when the
synthesis is performed in dimethylsulfoxide than when it is performed in
methanol, in alignment with experimental observations. In the early steps of
the nucleation process, we observe the formation of linear oligomers containing
metal ions and ligands, which start forming cycles later on. All simulations
lead to the formation of a final state that is highly-connected and partially
amorphous, which could be correlated to an intermediate species observed in
direct experiments. The mechanism of formation of this phase mainly consists of
the merging of smaller nuclei. Even though increasing temperature and the
reactants concentration lead to a similar nucleation speedup, there are
differences in ring populations and lifetimes within the highly-connected
amorphous intermediate phases that are formed in each case. Finally, important
differences in the free energy of Zn-2-methylimidazolate versus Zn-imidazolate
subsequent binding events are revealed and discussed.

Conclusion: 该方法在低能态计算中表现优异，对后续研究有积极影响。

Abstract: We developed a graph-based block-diagonalization (GBBD) method for the full
configuration interaction Hamiltonian of molecular systems to efficiently
calculate the exact eigenvalues of low-energy states. In this approach, the
non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are represented as edges on a
graph, which naturally decomposes into disconnected clusters. Each cluster
corresponds to an independent block in the block-diagonalized form of the
Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues in the low-energy sector were obtained by solving
the eigenvalue problem for each block matrix and by solving a modified
Hamiltonian subject to orthonormality constraints with respect to previously
computed lower-energy eigenstates. We applied the GBBD method to linear
hydrogen H chains ranging from H$_2$ to H$_{12}$. The results showed excellent
agreement with exact ones, confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the
proposed method. Finally, we discussed several physical properties with respect
to the number of H$_2$ molecules.

### [7] [Spin-Polaron Mediated Superconductivity in Doped Chern Antiferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22971)
*Xuepeng Wang,J. F. Mendez-Valderrama,Johannes S. Hofmann,Debanjan Chowdhury*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores the complex phase diagram of Chern antiferromagnets with competing interactions and spin-orbit coupling, showing how doping leads to superconductivity with dressed quasiparticles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay of topology, interactions, and spin-orbit coupling is crucial for studying exotic phases in moiré materials like twisted bilayer graphene.

Method: Used a time-reversal symmetric electronic model with tunable Chern bands and applied quantum Monte-Carlo computations to analyze the phase diagram.

Result: The system exhibits insulating Chern antiferromagnetic phases at commensurate fillings, and superconductivity appears upon doping, with spin-polaron excitations persisting under weak spin-orbit coupling.

Conclusion: The study paves the way for connecting microscopic models to real materials like twisted bilayer graphene, offering insights into the emergence of unconventional superconductivity.

Abstract: The study of interacting topological bands with a tunable bandwidth offers a
unique platform to study the interplay of intertwined orders and emergent
non-electronic excitations. Here we design a time-reversal symmetric and
sign-problem-free electronic model with tunable Chern bands carrying
valley-contrasting Chern number, interacting via competing (anti-)ferromagnetic
interactions. Using numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo computations, we
analyze the many-body phase-diagram as a function of temperature and band
filling fractions over a wide range of electronic bandwidth, interaction
anisotropy, and an Ising spin-orbit coupling. At a commensurate filling of the
Chern bands, the ground state hosts intra-valley ferromagnetic coherence and
inter-valley antiferomagnetism, thus realizing an insulating Chern
antiferromagnet (CAF). Upon doping, the ground-state develops
superconductivity, but where the low-energy charged quasiparticles are
composite objects -- electrons dressed by multiple spin-flip excitations. These
spin-polaron (or skyrmion) excitations persist in the presence of a weak
spin-orbit coupling. In a companion article, we address the emergent symmetries
and low-energy field-theoretic aspects of the problem and reveal the proximity
to a deconfined quantum critical point. We end by providing a general outlook
towards building microscopic connections with models of interacting moir\'e
materials, including twisted bilayer graphene, where many of the ingredients
considered here are naturally present.

Abstract: Tensor networks are an efficient platform to represent interesting quantum
states of matter as well as to compute physical observables and
information-theoretic quantities. We present a general protocol to construct
fixed-point tensor network representations for intrinsically mixed-state
topological phases, which exhibit nontrivial topological phenomena and do not
have pure-state counterparts. The method exploits the power of anyon
condensation in Choi states and is applicable to the cases where the target
states arise from pure-state topological phases subject to strong
decoherence/disorders in the Abelian sectors. Representative examples include
$m^a e^b$ decoherence of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, decohered non-Abelian $S_3$
quantum double as well as pure $Z$/$X$ decoherence of arbitrary CSS codes. An
example of chiral topological phases which cannot arise from local commuting
projector models are also presented.

### [9] [A Perturbative Approach to Symmetric Mass Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23032)
*Simon Martin,Tarun Grover*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Landau paradigm has been a powerful framework for understanding phase
transitions involving spontaneous symmetry breaking. In contrast, phase
transitions between two symmetric phases, where neither phase breaks any
symmetry, remain less explored. One intriguing class of such transitions
involves "symmetric mass generation" (SMG), where interactions drive a
transition from a gapless symmetric phase to a gapped symmetric phase. In this
work, we develop a controlled perturbative approach to study a class of such
transitions, based on an $\epsilon$-expansion around the critical dimension
where the SMG-inducing-interaction becomes marginal. Applying this method to
two distinct models, we identify a single-parameter-tuned transition in each
case, which we conjecture captures the universal critical behavior of the SMG
transition in these models. We compute universal quantities associated with
these transitions.

enhance the Hall conductivity, with values reaching up to -650 S/cm. These

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper explores orbital ordering in manganites using RIXS and REXS, identifying orbital excitations and their unique temperature dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the orbital ordering phenomenon and its excitations is crucial in condensed matter physics. This study aims to verify and characterize these excitations in manganites with a specific focus on orbital ordering and its behavior under varying temperatures.

Method: The authors employed a combination of soft x-ray resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) and resonant elastic scattering (REXS) to experimentally investigate low-energy excitations in manganites, particularly looking for features indicative of orbital ordering at specific q-points.

Result: The experimental data confirmed the presence of orbital ordering (OO) at q=(0.25,0.25,0), with low-energy excitations below 200 meV. Some of these excitations, particularly those in the 80-200 meV range, showed distinct temperature dependencies consistent with OO, suggesting they might be orbital excitations.

Conclusion: The study provides significant evidence for the existence of orbital ordering and identifies certain excitations as candidates for orbital excitations in manganites. This contributes to a deeper understanding of orbital magnetism and its relationship with magnetic and phononic properties in these materials.

Abstract: The electron in a solid can be considered a bound state of the three
independent, fundamental degrees of freedom creating quasi-particles: spinons,
carrying the electron spin; plasmons carrying the collective charge mode and
orbitons carrying its orbital degree of freedom. These fundamental degrees of
freedom could form ordering states in which dynamics or collective motions
could occurr and manifest as low-energy excitations. The exotic properties that
appear in the materials exhibiting these electronic orderings are associated
with these low-energy excitations. Although the orbital order (OO) and its
coupling to the spin system creates very interesting phenomena, the microscopic
origin of OO has been much less explored than other electronic properties as it
is very difficult to directly access experimental information from OO. Due to
the recent improvement in energy resolution and flux, soft x-ray resonant
inelastic scattering (RIXS) allows for a re-examination of orbital excitations
in manganites. Here, we present a study of low energy excitations in half doped
A-site ordered SmBaMn_{2}O_{6} through a combination of RIXS and soft x-ray
resonant elastic scattering (REXS) measurements. The obtained experimental data
confirm the OO at \mathbf{q} = (0.25, 0.25, 0) and find various low energy
excitations below 200 meV. while several excitations can be assigned to be of
magnetic and phononic origin, a group of excitations between 80 and 200 meV
show a temperature dependence distinctively following that of the OO making
them possible candidates for orbital excitations.

TL;DR: WV-HMC成功应用于Hubbard模型，解决 severe sign problem。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们对解决量子场论中的sign问题投入了很多努力，尤其是局域的问题。Hubbard模型作为 strongly correlated系统，sign问题尤为突出。寻找有效算法来处理sign问题至关重要。

Method: WV-HMC是一种替代Lefschetz thimbles算法的方法，旨在解决sign问题同时避免遍历性问题。这里的具体应用是将该方法用于Hubbard模型非半充满参数，使用6x6和8x8空间尺寸，计算了在β=6.4时的占据数。使用直接求解器处理Dirac矩阵反转，计算复杂度为O(N^3)，其中N是自由度的数量，与时空格点体积成比例。此外，还提到了一个使用伪费米子和迭代求解器的新算法，复杂度更低为O(N^2)，但需要更精细的参数调优。

Result: 结果表明，WV-HMC在sign问题严重的区域仍有效，甚至在常规非thimbles Monte Carlo方法失效时仍能工作。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了WV-HMC的应用范围，展示了其在解决量子强相互作用系统sign问题中的潜力。此外，为了解决更大的规模问题，提出了基于迭代求解器的新算法，尽管需要优化参数。

Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an
efficient and low-cost algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It mitigates
the sign problem while avoiding the ergodicity issues that are intrinsic to
algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In this study, we apply the WV-HMC
method to the Hubbard model away from half filling, which is known to suffer
from a severe sign problem. We compute the number density on lattices of
spatial size $6 \times 6$ and $8 \times 8$ at inverse temperature $\beta = 6.4$
using $N_t = 20$ Trotter steps. Our results show that the WV-HMC method remains
effective even in parameter regions where non-thimble Monte Carlo methods fail
due to severe sign problems. In this work, we employ direct solvers for fermion
matrix inversion, with a computational cost of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the
number of degrees of freedom and proportional to the spacetime lattice volume.
An alternative algorithm employing pseudofermions and iterative solvers, which
reduces the cost to $O(N^2)$ at the expense of careful parameter tuning, will
be discussed in a separate publication.

Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy
electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a
crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains
of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition
at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize
elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct
orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the
induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these
domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain
fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to
the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of
spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an
underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray
microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space
resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct
visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the
onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern
inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the
emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant
form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for
probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.

TL;DR: 电子弹性的显象在量子材料中被广泛观察到，这些材料具有不同的电子相关程度。论文提出了一种新的理论模型，能够整合弹性和二元组的相互作用，同时满足弹性兼容性关系，确保了晶格变形的可积性。该模型将相变划分为两个相互独立的领域：能发生相变的相和不能的相，后者受到微观位错的限制。研究结果解释了不同材料中物种种相变现象，并指出低温下可能只存在能发生相变的相。

Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying
degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital,
or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of
describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity,
by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However,
being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility
relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we
develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic
compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase
space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and
thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of
the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any
crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from
pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce
both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results
also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the
mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of
domain formation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了电子色 basictics（nematicity）与弹性和应变场之间的耦合关系，称为flow-elasticity。文中提出了一个基于旋转基的新理论框架，将应变张量的可容性通过适配性条件显式引入。结果显示，在理想晶体中，弹性效应抑制了不兼容的色应变，导致方向选择性的临界性；而在有缺陷的系统中，应变场会迫使nematic有序参数产生纵向和横向的共轭场，这些效应可以通过旋转基的变换得到解释。由于适配性是范德蒙德约束，这些结果适用于所有晶体系统。

Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of
rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic
order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While
both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through
the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order
partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's
role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of
geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline
defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that
incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical
basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon
the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations.
As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In
ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible
nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of
crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that
elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random
longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order
parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with
pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the
transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of
nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of
long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility
relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results
constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all
crystalline systems.

Abstract: We report on some properties of a quantum black hole obtained recently. The
correction to the Newtonian gravitational potential is proportional to a
coupling $\alpha$, which is the only free parameter of the theory. We constrain
the coupling using the perihelion advance, we compute the quasi-normal modes
for scalar (both massless and massive) and electromagnetic perturbations. We
find that all modes computed here are complex numbers characterized by a
positive real part and a negative imaginary part, while both parts increase
with the mass of the test scalar field. Also thermodynamics properties are
investigated from the classical and topological point of view. In this regard,
the quantum black hole exhibits the same behavior as the classical
Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, that is, it presents stable/unstable branches
in the Gibbs potential, one generating point and a topological charge $W=0$.

### [17] [Consequences of Undecidability in Physics on the Theory of Everything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22950)
*Mir Faizal,Lawrence M. Krauss,Arshid Shabir,Francesco Marino*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses how quantum gravity might not rely on spacetime and instead use non-algorithmic methods, touching on computational limits. Influence from Gödel, Tarski, and Chaitin is mentioned. Concludes that simulating the universe as a simulation is impossible because simulations are algorithmic, and thus reality must have non-algorithmic aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether the universe could be a simulation or require beyond-computation explanations is crucial. This paper connects foundational math theorems to the nature of physical theories, challenging the idea of a comprehensible simulation and shedding light on quantum gravity. As someone interested in both philosophy and physics, this topic is intriguing but complex to parse. I want a concise yet comprehensive summary that highlights the main points and arguments to better grasp the implications. Additionally, knowing the structure of the argument (tldr, motivation, method, result, conclusion) would help me verify if a deeper analysis is needed or if the basics are clear. This seems like a good starting point for further exploration of these connections between computability and physical theories. Moreover, it's essential to understand how theorems from mathematical logic apply to theories like quantum gravity, which isn't purely algorithmic. This paper pushes boundaries by linking abstract math results to concrete physical theories, making it a valuable read for understanding the limits of theoretical physics and computation. I also wonder how the constructed Meta-Theory of Everything differs from other theories, and how it resolves the puzzle of spacetime emergence without being a simulation, adding an extra layer of complexity than simple simulation arguments.

Method: The paper starts by discussing general relativity and the problem of singularities, linking it to quantum gravity. It then introduces the connection between quantum gravity and spacetime emergence as a quantum system of degrees of freedom. The paper brings in Goedel's, Tarski's, and Chaitin's theorems to argue that an algorithmic 'Theory of Everything' is impossible. It constructs a 'Meta-Theory of Everything' grounded in non-algorithmic understanding to account for undecidable phenomena and argues against the universe being a simulation by showing that simulations are algorithmic and reality might have non-algorithmic aspects. The paper seems to focus on using mathematical logic theorems as tools to explore the limitations of physical theories, particularly those concerning spacetime and computation. It builds its argument step by step, starting from physics, moving through logic, and ending in a conclusion about the nature of the universe.

Result: The paper presents a framework where certain aspects of reality are beyond algorithmic understanding, necessitating a non-algorithmic theory. It suggests that a full theory of everything must incorporate such elements, thus concluding that the universe cannot be entirely simulated algorithmically by an outside observer. The conclusion ties together logic theorems with physical theory to posits that reality extends beyond what can be computed algorithmically and thus a simulation in the strict algorithmic sense is impossible.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by outlining a Meta-Theory of Everything that relies on non-algorithmic understanding, showing how undecidable phenomena can be accommodated. It argues that the breakdown in computational descriptions doesn't imply a scientific breakdown because the universe may have non-algorithmic aspects. Lastly, it asserts that the universe cannot be a simulation due to the inherent algorithmic constraints of any putative simulation, thus reality must require beyond-computation explanations.

Abstract: General relativity treats spacetime as dynamical and exhibits its breakdown
at singularities. This failure is interpreted as evidence that quantum gravity
is not a theory formulated within spacetime; instead, it must explain the very
emergence of spacetime from deeper quantum degrees of freedom, thereby
resolving singularities. Quantum gravity is therefore envisaged as an axiomatic
structure, and algorithmic calculations acting on these axioms are expected to
generate spacetime. However, G\"odel's incompleteness theorems, Tarski's
undefinability theorem, and Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness
establish intrinsic limits on any such algorithmic programme. Together, these
results imply that a wholly algorithmic "Theory of Everything" is impossible:
certain facets of reality will remain computationally undecidable and can be
accessed only through non-algorithmic understanding. We formalize this by
constructing a "Meta-Theory of Everything" grounded in non-algorithmic
understanding, showing how it can account for undecidable phenomena and
demonstrating that the breakdown of computational descriptions of nature does
not entail a breakdown of science. Because any putative simulation of the
universe would itself be algorithmic, this framework also implies that the
universe cannot be a simulation.

*Sumanta Chakraborty,Valerio De Luca,Leonardo Gualtieri,Paolo Pani*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines the dynamical tidal Love numbers for Schwarzschild black holes and finds that they have finite, non-vanishing corrections at second-order in frequency. However, these corrections are too small to be detectable with current gravitational wave detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses whether black holes exhibit non-zero dynamical tidal Love numbers, which are crucial for understanding their response to tidal forces in general relativity.

Method: The authors use the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates to compute second-order perturbations, introducing a new response function without arbitrary constants.

Result: They find quadratic corrections to the Love numbers, indicating a dynamic deformation of the black hole, though the effects are insignificant for detection.

Conclusion: While the findings contribute to black hole physics, the corrections are too small to impact future gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish
identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e.,
in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated
by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at
finite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of
a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By
employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are
regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme.
Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the
perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our
analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order
and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale
dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing
conservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly
demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We
then assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the
gravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express
the correction in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to
be matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we
argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with
future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding
phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering
at the same post-Newtonian order.

TL;DR:  paper discusses how gravitational wave propagation is affected in non-Riemannian spacetime with non-minimal coupling, leading to subluminal phase velocity and wave damping effects due to interactions with matter and spacetime structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  authors explore alternative spacetime structures to justify modified gravitational wave properties, potentially for cosmological or high-energy contexts

Method:  analysis of perturbed spacetime with non-minimal coupling

Result:  gravitational waves show properties like subluminal phase velocity and damping when interacting with matter and spacetime's non-Riemannian features

Conclusion:  non-Riemannian spacetime with non-minimal coupling could support gravitational waves with novel behaviors, challenging conventional GR results

Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian
spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is
considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the
Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on
a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum
tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations,
eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can
be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum
tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a
suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor
polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the
constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic
damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter
coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where
propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in
the frequency spectrum.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the inextensibility problem of the spacetime at a future boundary
point. We detect the inextensibility of the spacetime by the
volume-distance-ratio asymptote of the timelike diamond approaching the future
boundary point. The fundamental idea is to compare the asymptote with the one
in Minkowski spacetime. By this idea, we establish the inextensibility criteria
for both $C^{0,1}$ and $C^0$ regularities. As applications, we prove that i)
$C^{0,1}$-inextensibility of the interior solution of the spherically
self-similar naked singularity in the gravitational collapse of a massless
scalar field constructed by Christodoulou. The key estimate is on the volume
form of the interior solution of the naked singularity in a self-similar
coordinate system. ii) $C^0$-inextensibility of the spatially flat FLRW
spacetime with asymptotically linear scale factor $a(t) \sim t$. The key
estimate is the volume comparison with the spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime
with the scale factor $t$ which is the causal past of a point in the Minkowski
spacetime.

Abstract: We employ multiple-scale analysis to systematically derive analytical
approximations describing the cosmological propagation of gravitational waves
beyond general relativity, in a framework with two interacting spin-2 fields
with time-dependent couplings. Such techniques allow us to accurately track the
evolution of a system with slowly evolving time-dependent couplings over a
large number of oscillation periods. We focus on tensor modes propagating on
sub-horizon scales in a universe dominated by dark energy and explicitly derive
solutions for a general class of models. To illustrate the possible
applications of our general scheme and further corroborate our analytical
results, we calculate the evolution of tensor perturbations in some
phenomenological toy models and compare them with numerical simulations. We
show that, generically, the interactions of independent spin-2 fields lead to
non-trivial modifications to the amplitude and phase of the detected waveform,
which are different from those obtained in other modified gravity theories with
a single graviton. This provides an avenue to test and constrain gravitational
models with new fundamental physical fields.

Abstract: In addition to curvature singularities, electrovacuum black holes in general
relativity exhibit thermodynamic singularities. These so-called Davies' points
occur at non-extremal values of charge and spin where the heat capacity
diverges and may indicate a type of theoretical incompleteness. The
thermodynamic regularity of several families of static, asymptotically-flat
spacetimes with bounded curvature invariants is examined using a
theory-agnostic framework, showing that while they may be regular in physical
space they are generally not in phase space. The inclusion of angular momentum,
via the Newman-Janis algorithm, makes the set of such "doubly regular" objects
especially restrictive. It is argued that, if thermodynamic regularity is to be
considered a desirable property for an astrophysical black hole, these
considerations could be used to narrow down the viable pool of regular
extensions to the Kerr-Newman metric.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a Lagrangian model describing a particle
constrained to move along non-degenerate conic sections, parameterized by the
orbital eccentricity \( e \). In the non-relativistic regime, we apply the
Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to identify a set of four second-class constraints,
compute the corresponding Dirac brackets, and isolate the true physical degrees
of freedom. This procedure yields a unified Hamiltonian treatment of circular
(\( e = 0 \)), elliptical (\( 0 < e < 1 \)), parabolic (\( e = 1 \)), and
hyperbolic (\( e > 1 \)) trajectories. We then extend the analysis to the
relativistic case, where we observe a similar constraint structure and
construct the associated Dirac brackets accordingly. Finally, using the
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we identify a set of non-involutive constraints; by
introducing generalized brackets, we restore integrability and derive the
correct equations of motion. A comparative analysis of both formalisms
highlights their complementary features and deepens our understanding of the
dynamics governing particles restricted to conic geometries.

### [27] [Canonical Form of Born-Infeld Inspired Gravity Coupled to Scalar Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23424)
*J. Kluson*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how the Born-Infeld-inspired gravity theory, when combined with scalar fields, can be put into a canonical form using the Faddeev-Jackiw approach. The action splits into two parts: one resembling standard General Relativity and another with a complex structure due to the Born-Infeld gravity action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Born-Infeld gravity is a generalization of Einstein's theory of gravity, incorporating nonlinear corrections that might be relevant in various high-energy physics scenarios. This paper aims to explore the canonical structure of such a theory, which is essential for understanding its quantization and physical implications.

Method: The authors employ the Faddeev-Jackiw approach, a method in theoretical physics used to analyze the canonical structure of constrained systems. This technique is particularly effective for theories with gauge invariance and nonlinear interactions, such as Born-Infeld gravity.

Result: Through their analysis using the Faddeev-Jackiw method, the authors successfully decompose the total action into two distinct parts. The first part mirrors the conventional General Relativity canonical action, while the second part exhibits a more complicated structure because of the intricate nature of the Born-Infeld gravity component. This decomposition likely simplifies further analysis of the theory's dynamics and symmetries.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Born-Infeld-inspired gravity coupled with scalar fields can be effectively analyzed using the Faddeev-Jackiw approach, providing a clearer understanding of the theory's canonical structure. This work not only advances our knowledge of alternative gravitational theories but also paves the way for exploring quantization and potential observational consequences of such theories.

Abstract: In this short note we find canonical form of Born-Infeld inspired gravity
coupled to scalar fields using Faddeev-Jackiw approach. We show that canonical
form of the action splits into two parts: First part has the same form as
General Relativity canonical action while the matter part has complicated form

TL;DR: The research incorporates noncommutative corrections into gravitational waveforms using multiple templates, leading to tighter bounds on the noncommutative parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain noncommutative gravity using GW observations, which could validate quantum spacetime models.

Method: Constructed waveform templates by adding noncommutative corrections and used the IMRPhenomXHM model with Bayesian analysis on GW events.

Result: Derived tighter constraints on Λ (sqrt(Λ)<0.46) using GW190814, compared to previous bounds of sqrt(Λ)<3.5.

Conclusion: These improved bounds support noncommutative gravity as a viable theory, with further constraints possible with more data.

Abstract: Recent advances in noncommutative geometry and string theory have stimulated
increasing research on noncommutative gravity. The detection of gravitational
waves~(GW) opens a new window for testing this theory using observed data. In
particular, the leading correction from noncommutative gravity to the GW of
compact binary coalescences appears at the second post-Newtonian~(2PN) order.
This correction is proportional to the dimensionless parameter
$\Lambda\equiv|\theta^{0i}|/(l_Pt_P)$, where $\theta^{0i}$ denotes the
antisymmetric tensor characterizing noncommutative spacetime, and $l_P, t_P$
represent the Plank length and time, respectively. Previous study have used the
phase deviation from general relativity at the 2PN order, as measured in
GW150914, to constrain noncommutative gravity, resulting in an upper bound of
$\sqrt{\Lambda}<3.5$. Another analysis, based on multiple events from the
GWTC-1 catalog, has obtained consistent bounds. In this work, we construct the
noncommutative gravity waveform in the Parameterized Post-Einsteinian
framework. Based on the \texttt{IMRPhenomXHM} template, we incorporate both the
dominant (2,2) mode and several higher-order modes, including (2,1), (3,3),
(3,2), and (4,4). We first reanalyze the GW150914 with a Bayesian parameter
estimation and derive a 95th percentile upper bound on noncommutative gravity,
obtaining $\sqrt{\Lambda}<0.68$. We then analyze GW190814 and obtain an even
tighter 95th percentile upper bound of $\sqrt{\Lambda}<0.46$. This represent
the strongest constraint on noncommutative gravity derived from real GW
observations to date.

TL;DR: The paper models black holes as condensates of non-Abelian anyons, linking their entropy and Hawking temperature with quantum gravity and topological quantum computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black hole information paradox has been a significant challenge in theoretical physics, seeking a resolution through quantum gravity and information theory.

Method: Mathematical modeling of black holes as quantum systems using non-Abelian anyons, leveraging topological quantum field theory.

Result: Derivation of entropy spectrum, corrected Hawking temperature, and a mechanism for unitary evaporation without entanglement, offering a bridge to quantum computation.

Conclusion: Provides a novel approach to resolve the black hole information paradox using topological methods, linking quantum gravity and quantum computation.

Abstract: We model black holes as condensates of non-Abelian anyons forming a
topologically ordered shell at the horizon. Combined with area quantization,
the constrained fusion Hilbert space yields a discrete entropy spectrum
consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. Assuming a quantized mass
spectrum with nonuniform gaps, we derive a nonthermal radiation profile with a
corrected Hawking temperature and entropy, including logarithmic and
inverse-area corrections. This framework localizes quantum information to the
horizon without invoking entanglement across it, offering a unitary evaporation
mechanism governed by topological degrees of freedom. This offers a natural
setting for resolving the information paradox without recourse to firewalls,
remnants, or trans-horizon entanglement. We also show that the Hawking
temperature arises from classical equipartition on the shell, explaining the
thermal character of the spectrum at leading order. Overall, our results
provide a microscopic, algebraic approach to the black hole information paradox
and establish a bridge between quantum gravity and topological quantum
computation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational waves and quantum gravity are hot topics in astrophysics, this paper connects condensed matter physics effects like squeezing to gravitational physics, which is a meaningful direction. The use of Chern-Simons terms in gravity also aligns with current research trends exploring beyond general relativity effects.

Method: The method involves studying (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes with Kerr-type black holes surrounded by axions with various origins, including models from string theory and Einstein-Cartan theory. The analysis uses effective gravitational actions including Chern-Simons terms. The entanglement is analyzed using a Takagi-like decomposition and polarization basis.

Result: Key findings include that conventional GR effects dominate over CS terms, sufficient axion cloud lifetimes allow significant squeezing via GR. The entanglement structure differs based on the source of the axial current's polarization. Entanglement is more pronounced in certain polarization states when dominated by GR or CS effects.

Conclusion: This paper opens a new window on quantum gravitational effects by applying condensed matter physics concepts. It suggests that through massive compact objects like Kerr black holes, novel mechanisms for generating entangled gravitational states could be identified, potentially observable in future quantum gravity experiments or simulations. More research is needed to validate the theoretical models and their real-world implications in astrophysics.

Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of
squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding
rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions
is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and
compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries
exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan
theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons
(CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a
Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance
and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The
specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are
massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a
Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it
is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity
(GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to
the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the
axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through
the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be
produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the
structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a
left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the
anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous explanation of constructing Penrose diagrams for the maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime, serving as an educational resource for graduate students in physics and applied mathematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to create an educational resource for advanced students by providing detailed explanations of Penrose diagrams and their construction for the Schwarzschild spacetime, which is fundamental in general relativity.

Method: The method involves explaining the basic concepts, outlining the requirements, defining Penrose diagrams, constructing the specific diagram, and applying it to compare coordinate systems.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates the construction of the Penrose diagram for the Schwarzschild spacetime, highlighting its visual and analytical properties, and effectively compares different coordinate systems using Penrose diagrams.

Conclusion: This paper is a valuable educational tool for students seeking to understand Penrose diagrams and their application to the Schwarzschild spacetime.

Abstract: We present a detailed, mathematically rigorous description of the
construction procedure of Penrose diagrams for the example of the maximal
analytic extension of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. To this end, we
first outline the basic idea underlying Penrose diagrams, state the general
requirements on the spacetimes to be visualized, and give a definition of
Penrose diagrams. We then construct the Penrose diagram of the maximally
analytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime and discuss the characteristics
and properties corresponding to this particular Penrose diagram. As an
application, we work out the differences between the spacetime and null
variants of the canonical advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate
representations of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime by explicitly
constructing and visually analyzing Penrose diagrams equipped with foliations
of the level sets of the respective Eddington-Finkelstein time and null
coordinates. Throughout the course of the paper, we provide brief accounts of
the relevant parts of the seminal publications on the exterior Schwarzschild
solution by Schwarzschild himself, Kruskal, Eddington, Finkelstein, and
Penrose. This paper is primarily of pedagogical nature aimed at graduate
students in physics and applied mathematics (with a background in general
relativity and differential geometry), serving mainly as an introduction to
Penrose diagrams and coordinate representations of the exterior Schwarzschild
spacetime.

### [32] [Disentangling spinning and nonspinning binary black hole populations with spin sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23663)
*Lillie Szemraj,Sylvia Biscoveanu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of distinguishing spinning and nonspinning binary black holes using gravitational wave observations and spin sorting, concluding that current data don't support a fully nonspinning population.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole spins is crucial for studying their formation and evolution. However, current models struggle to accommodate a sub-population of nonspinning black holes, prompting this analysis to explore the use of spin sorting in distinguishing these components.

Method: Simulated BBH populations are analyzed, sorting components by spin magnitude instead of mass, to evaluate their distinguishability.

Result: The analysis shows that spinning and nonspinning populations can be reliably separated using spin sorting.

Conclusion: Observations suggest the BBH population isn't fully nonspinning, but could consist of systems with a single spinning black hole or up to 80% nonspinning.

Abstract: The individual component spins of binary black holes (BBH) are difficult to
resolve using gravitational-wave observations but carry key signatures of the
processes shaping their formation and evolution. Recent analyses have found
conflicting evidence for a sub-population of black holes with negligible spin,
but the Default spin magnitude population model used in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
analyses cannot formally accommodate an excess of systems with zero spin. In
this work, we analyze several different simulated BBH populations to
demonstrate that even in the face of this mismodeling, spinning and nonspinning
populations can be reliably distinguished using the Default spin magnitude
population model coupled with spin sorting. While typical analyses sort the
binary components by their masses, sorting the components by their spin
magnitudes instead offers a complementary view of the properties of individual
systems consistent with equal mass and of population-level properties, given
binary evolution processes like tidal-spin up that predict asymmetric spin
magnitudes among the binary components. We conclude that current observations
of the BBH population are inconsistent with a fully nonspinning population, but
could be explained by a population with only one spinning black hole per binary
or a population with up to 80% nonspinning sources.

### [33] [Teleparallel gravity from the principal bundle viewpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23672)
*Sebastian Brezina,Eugenia Boffo,Martin Krššák*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study presents a thorough analysis of whether TEGR can function as a gauge theory by choosing suitable principal bundles and demonstrate that TEGR's gauge group can align with the full diffeomorphism group.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reconcile TEGR, a modification of General Relativity, with the principles of gauge theories by examining appropriate mathematical frameworks.

Method: The authors analyze TEGR within the Trautman framework, focusing on the concept of absolute elements and gauge symmetries. They explore two potential bundles: one with the Poincaré group and another with the Lorentz group, and evaluate how the teleparallel connection's dynamics affect the gauge group.

Result: By selecting specific principal bundles and treating the teleparallel connection as a non-dynamical absolute element, the authors establish TEGR's gauge group as the full diffeomorphism group.

Conclusion: TEGR can indeed be formulated as a gauge theory with the full diffeomorphism group, provided the teleparallel connection is non-dynamical and the canonical 1-form is designated as the sole absolute element.

Abstract: We examine whether the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR)
can be formulated as a gauge theory in the language of connections on principal
bundles. We argue in favor of using either the affine bundle with the
Poincar\'e group or, equivalently, the orthonormal frame bundle with the
Lorentz group as the structure group. Following the framework of
Trautman--where gauge symmetries are determined using the absolute elements--we
set to identify the absolute elements and gauge symmetries of TEGR. The problem
of a non-dynamical teleparallel connection raises the question of whether it
should be treated as an absolute element. If so, the gauge group of TEGR is
potentially some undetermined subgroup of the diffeomorphism group. On the
other hand, if the connection is allowed to be non-dynamical but the only
absolute element is taken to be the canonical 1-form of the frame bundle, we
recover the whole diffeomorphism group as the gauge group of TEGR.

### [34] [Simulating Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Finite-temperature Equations of State: The influences of the slope of the symmetry energy and artificial heating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23684)
*Henrique Gieg,Maximiliano Ujevic,Armen Sedrakian,Tim Dietrich*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents numerical simulations of binary neutron star mergers exploring the effects of symmetry energy slope (L_sym). They find that varying L_sym impacts merger dynamics, ejecta properties, and r-process yields but gravitational waves may not be sufficient to distinguish L_sym. Electromagnetic counterparts might show more clear signatures related to L_sym but further work is needed for a direct link.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the implications of varying symmetry energy slope (L_sym) in neutron star mergers is important for exploring aspects like gravitational wave signals, r-process yields, and electromagnetic counterparts.

Method: They used numerical relativity simulations with equations of state parameterized from covariant density functional theory, varying L_sym while keeping skewness fixed. They analyzed ejecta properties and r-process yields.

Result: Varying L_sym affects merger dynamics, increases the steepness of the equation of state, which impacts the heating and thermal support. Ejecta composition changes with different L_sym, leading to distinct r-process yields at lower mass numbers (A ≤ 120). Electromagnetic counterparts show some signs but a direct link to L_sym isn't clear yet.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that L_sym has plausible impacts on neutron star mergers, which could be observable through r-process signatures or electromagnetic counterparts, but more research is needed to establish a direct connection and tease apart these astrophysical signals from numerical simulations.

Abstract: We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary
neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope
of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of
equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density
functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of
$L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a
set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of
state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with
subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related
structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with
theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves
are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we
find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations,
which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our
extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find
that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower
mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts
are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm
sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the
ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.

Result: 分析表明，在GR过程中，两个轴ion的湮灭都会产生两个引力子的受 squeeze 状态下的激发电效应，而CS引力导致的轴ion衰[root]产生的引力子激发效率要小得多。

Conclusion: 标准广义相对论在轴ion湮灭过程中导致的引力子的受 squeeze 状态下的配对效应远强于带有微分引力omaly的Chern-Simons引力效应。轴ion云的长期存活使得CGS引力的影响仍然显著，但GR的贡献占主导。

Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS)
gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the
production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This
involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a
superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of
the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the
squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the
superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR
process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many
orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons,
induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant
squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose
lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is
effective.

Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) particle detectors have the potential to provide time
resolutions and robust performance in extreme environments which exceed that of
silicon detectors. In this work 4H-SiC low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs) and
complementary PiN diodes were irradiated with 2.5 GeV protons at fluences up to
3.33$\times$10$^{14}$ p/cm$^2$. The electrostatic performance of both
irradiated and non-irradiated devices was evaluated using current-voltage (I-V)
and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Moreover, charge collection
measurements using $\alpha$ particles were also conducted. SiC LGADs displayed
a loss in rectification and gain with increasing proton fluence. Additionally,
the reduction in capacitance and OFF-state current pointed to compensation of
the gain layer as a gain reducing mechanism. The introduction of radiation
induced defects also hinders carrier acceleration reducing impact ionization,
leading to further gain reduction. However, despite the reduction in device
performance, the demonstration of a measurable signal and gain after
irradiation points to the potential of SiC LGAD detectors for future high
energy physics applications.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body
systems is a fundamental challenge in modern physics, with profound
implications for advancing quantum technologies. Typically, periodically driven
systems in the absence of conservation laws thermalize to a featureless
"infinite-temperature" state, erasing all memory of their initial conditions.
However, this paradigm can break down through mechanisms such as integrability,
many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert space
fragmentation. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical
freezing, a distinct mechanism of thermalization breakdown in driven systems,
and demonstrate its application in quantum sensing using an ensemble of
approximately $10^4$ interacting nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond. By
precisely controlling the driving frequency and detuning, we observe emergent
long-lived spin magnetization and coherent oscillatory micromotions, persisting
over timescales exceeding the interaction-limited coherence time ($T_2$) by
more than an order of magnitude. Leveraging these unconventional dynamics, we
develop a dynamical-freezing-enhanced ac magnetometry that extends optimal
sensing times far beyond $T_2$, outperforming conventional dynamical decoupling
magnetometry with a 4.3 dB sensitivity enhancement. Our results not only
provide clear experimental observation of dynamical freezing -- a peculiar
mechanism defying thermalization through emergent conservation laws -- but also
establish a robust control method generally applicable to diverse physical
platforms, with broad implications in quantum metrology and beyond.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The canonical-ensemble description of reactive quantum gas mixtures is
reformulated by incorporating a single global particle-number-conservation
constraint over the combined spectra of inter-converting species. This
constraint replaces the conventional equality of chemical potentials.
Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein correlations naturally emerge across one-particle
energy eigenstates of species sharing identical spin-statistics, which in
ergodic single-systems manifest as intrinsic features of the equilibrium state.
By embedding all microstates linked by conversion pathways, the framework
incorporates concentration fluctuations in the statistical description. The
formalism offers fresh insights into quantum chemical equilibrium in reactive
mixtures with composition fluctuations and smoothly reduces to the classical
ideal gas limit via an extended partition function that generalizes classical
chemical-equilibrium treatments.

*Gabriele Calliari,Robert Ott,Hannes Pichler,Torsten V. Zache*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue that quantum field theories (QFTs), both classical and quantum, face when regularizing infinitely many degrees of freedom through a process called field digitization (FD). The authors propose interpreting the parameter N as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense and introduce field digitization scaling (FDS) to analyze FD by varying N. They study the 2D classical N-state clock model as a Z_N FD of the U(1)-symmetric XY model and extend FDS to include finite bond dimension χ by utilizing tensor network calculations. They also establish a connection between their classical findings and the ground state of a (2+1)D Z_N lattice gauge theory, which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics (QED). This breakthrough opens up potential applications of FDS in quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, helping to analyze the continuum limit of digitized QFTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum field theories is fundamental in modern physics. However, the regularization of such theories presents significant challenges, especially due to the infinite degrees of freedom. This paper introduces a novel approach through field digitization, interpreting the discretization parameter N as a coupling in the renormalization group sense, aiming to develop a comprehensive framework for continuum results. The proposed method, field digitization scaling, expands the applicability of digitization techniques to more complex quantum systems, offering a new pathway for quantum simulations and analysis of the continuum limit.

Method: The authors employ effective field theory in conjunction with the renormalization group (RG) technique to analyze the field digitization process. They use numerical tensor network calculations with finite bond dimension χ to investigate the phase transitions and critical behavior induced by varying N. By connecting their classical model findings to the ground state of a quantum lattice gauge theory, they validate their approach and extend the applicability of FDS beyond classical systems, incorporating quantum effects.

Result: The study reveals an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite N using FDS. This crossover is successfully demonstrated numerically with tensor networks, and a direct connection is established between the 2D classical Z_N clock model and the (2+1)D Z_N lattice gauge theory's ground state. This shows that FDS can effectively describe the interplay of discretization parameter N and finite bond dimension χ, providing a robust framework for analyzing the continuum limit in digitized QFTs.

Conclusion: This paper provides a groundbreaking approach to understanding the regularization of quantum field theories through field digitization, interpreting N as a renormalization group coupling. By introducing field digitization scaling, the authors successfully address the limitations of current regularization methods, particularly in higher dimensions. Their findings not only advance theoretical understanding but also pave the way for practical applications in quantum simulation, offering a new tool to study the continuum limits of complex quantum systems in higher spatial dimensions.

Abstract: The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum,
requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the
context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$
discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is
currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter
$N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example,
we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field
theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the
FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different
$N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\textit{field digitization
scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond
dimension $\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover
around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating
that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\chi$ and $N$. Finally,
we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the
ground state of a (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a
FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for
applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher
spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum
limit of digitized quantum field theories.

Motivation: The paper combines majorization theory, a foundational concept in comparing distributions in fields like math, physics, info theory, and economics, with quasiprobability distributions, essential in quantum mechanics and signal processing. The motivation is to extend a well-known mathematical result into a quantum context to explore new applications in quantum theory.

Method: The paper discusses majorization theory, generalizes the Hardy, Littlewood, and Pólya theorem to continuous quasiprobability distributions, and provides applications in quantum resource theories. They introduce the concept of majorization for quasiprobability distributions over infinite measure spaces and prove the equivalence of four definitions for majorization and relative majorization in this setting.

Result: They demonstrate the new applications in quantum resource theories, particularly in quantum optics, and focus on the Wigner function. The results provide a significant extension of majorization framework for integrable functions in quantum mechanics and beyond.

Conclusion: The paper successfully applies majorization theory to quasiprobability distributions, proving a generalized Hardy-type theorem and offering new insights and tools for quantum resource theories, especially concerning the Wigner function in quantum optics. This work opens new avenues for exploring quantum state conversions and resource theories application.

Abstract: Majorization theory is a powerful mathematical tool to compare the disorder

distributions over infinite measure spaces. Generalizing a seminal theorem by
Hardy, Littlewood, and P\'olya, we prove the equivalence of four definitions
for both majorization and relative majorization in this setting. We give
several applications of our results in the context of quantum resource
theories, obtaining new families of resource monotones and no-goes for quantum
state conversions. A prominent example we explore is the Wigner function in
quantum optics. More generally, our results provide an extensive majorization
framework for assessing the disorder of integrable functions over infinite
measure spaces.

Conclusion: 量子 scar 是控制孤立量子系统非马尔科夫性的一个关键因素，这为探索更复杂的量子现象提供了新方向。

Abstract: Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an
open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary
evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the
latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization.
Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state
has spectral weight on the so-called quantum scar states, which are
non-thermalizing states embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal
states. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of
quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances
non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP
model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of
scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to
have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing
information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between
temporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of
subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that
scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished)
subsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories
associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the
interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to
investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum
many-body systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses using pump-probe spectroscopy on quantum many-body systems, specifically the mixed-field Ising model, to study non-equilibrium dynamics. It employs quantum computer simulations to explore bound states, quench dynamics, and false vacuum decay, concluding that pump-probe can be effective without ancillary qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating complex quantum systems out-of-equilibrium is challenging. The paper proposes using pump-probe spectroscopy on quantum computers, aiming to avoid the need for ancillary qubits, which simplifies simulations and reduces resource requirements.

Method: The study involves quantum computer simulations of the mixed-field Ising model, focusing on pump-probe experiments under different quench dynamics. Non-equal time correlation functions are analyzed to study bound states and false vacuum decay.

Result: The research identifies the emergence of bound states and Bloch oscillations when simulating false vacuum decay. It demonstrates that pump-probe spectroscopy is effective for studying non-equilibrium dynamics without requiring additional qubits.

Conclusion: This work validates the use of pump-probe methods on classical and quantum computers for understanding out-of-equilibrium systems, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and simplifying computational resources.

Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of
quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have
proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving,
and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use
this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the
longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the
spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the
discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under
different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and
then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study
false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the
ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the
emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived
oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating
systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe
experiments without needing ancillary qubits.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel gyroscopic effect using Rydberg atoms, inspired by the Foucault pendulum, which could be demonstrated in an atomic-optical setup with specific rotation parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces an interesting application of Rydberg atoms, which are highly excited states, to mimic a physical effect typically associated with macroscopic objects like pendulums. This could have implications for understanding quantum-classical analogies and applications in quantum systems.

Method: Mathematical modeling using the Kepler Hamiltonian, including an additional uniaxial anisotropy from optical ponderomotive force. The effect is compared to the Foucault pendulum’s geometric rotation, suggesting a similar mechanism in atomic systems.

Result: The authors predict that by rotating an atomic setup within specific time frames (1-10 microseconds and milliseconds), a measurable gyroscopic effect can be observed in Rydberg atoms, providing a potential experimental setup for testing quantum rotation effects.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for exploring quantum analogs of macroscopic phenomena, offering a platform to study the interplay between atomic dynamics and mechanical rotations in controlled experiments.

Abstract: We predict a gyroscopic effect that can be demonstrated with Rydberg atoms
following the dynamics of a Kepler Hamiltonian with an additional uniaxial
anisotropy induced by optical ponderomotive force. This effect is analogous to
the rotation of the Foucault pendulum in response to the Earth's rotation. We
argue that in Rydberg states a similar geometric angle can be generated by
mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s
and $1~$ms.

Abstract: Although introduced originally for entanglement, quantum repeaters and
swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such
as quantum discord. Introduced by Mundarain and Ladr\'on de Guevara,
local-available quantum correlations (LAQC) are a promising yet understudied
quantum correlation. Recently, Bellor\'{\i}n et al. obtained exact analytical
results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Starting from
those previous results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for five families of
one-parameter 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial state
and the one used for the projective measurement are correlated, the final state
will have non-zero LAQC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for a reliable quantum internet has led researchers to explore various quantum communication protocols, particularly entanglement distribution. Ensuring these protocols function well under realistic error conditions is crucial, and this paper addresses that by comparing two protocols using specific metrics.

Method: The study uses a lightweight simulation framework to evaluate both sequential and parallel entanglement distribution protocols. The simulation focuses on key metrics: fidelity of distributed entangled states and hashing rate. The framework simplifies the simulation of complex quantum processes by reducing them to memory and time calculations, allowing for efficient analysis across various network sizes and noise parameters.

Result: The simulation results show that the parallel protocol consistently outperforms the sequential protocol, especially in the hashing rate metric, due to reduced runtime. This indicates that parallel protocols are more efficient and scalable, making them a viable option for real-world quantum internet applications.

Conclusion: Based on the simulation findings, the paper concludes that parallel entanglement distribution protocols are a strong candidate for implementation in a realizable quantum internet. The framework they developed provides a practical and efficient tool for evaluating such protocols under realistic conditions.

Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight simulation framework for evaluating
asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models.
We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is
established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to
generate entanglement simultaneously. We evaluate the performance of each
protocol using two key metrics: the fidelity of distributed entangled states,
and the hashing rate, a measure of entanglement efficiency. These metrics are
compared between both protocols across a range of network sizes and noise
parameters. We demonstrate that the parallel protocol consistently outperforms
the sequential, particularly in the hashing rate metric due to reduced runtime,
suggesting that parallel protocols are a strong candidate for a realizable
quantum Internet. Our framework offers an accessible and scalable tool for
evaluating entanglement distribution strategies, by reducing the simulation of
complex quantum processes to simple memory time calculations.

Abstract: State-dependent conformational changes play a central role in molecular
dynamics, yet they are often difficult to observe or simulate due to their
complexity and ultrafast nature. One alternative approach is to emulate such
phenomena using quantum simulations with cold, trapped ions. In their
electronic ground state, these ions form long-lived Wigner crystals. When
excited to high-lying electronic Rydberg states, the ions experience a modified
trapping potential, resulting in a strong coupling between their electronic and
vibrational degrees of freedom. In an ion crystal, this vibronic coupling
creates electronic state-dependent potential energy surfaces that can support
distinct crystal structures -- closely resembling the conformational changes of
molecules driven by electronic excitations. Here, we present the first
experimental observation of this effect, by laser-coupling a single ion at the
centre of a three-ion crystal to a Rydberg state. By tuning the system close to
a structural phase transition, the excitation induces a state-dependent
conformational change, transforming the Wigner crystal from a linear to a
zigzag configuration. This structural change leads to a strong hybridisation
between vibrational and electronic states, producing a clear spectroscopic
signature in the Rydberg excitation. Our findings mark the first experimental
step towards using Rydberg ions to create and study artificial molecular
systems. change leads to a strong hybridisation between vibrational and

Abstract: We show an explicit $N$-qubit protocol involving one-axis-twisted spin
squeezed states, that allows for simultaneous phase and dephasing strength
estimation with precision that asymptotically matches fundamental quantum
metrological bounds. The relevance of the protocol goes beyond this particular

at most constant asymptotic quantum enhancement, can be reduced to this problem
via an appropriately tailored quantum error-correction procedure.

*Clara Wassner,Jack Davis,Sacha Cerf,Ulysse Chabaud,Francesco Arzani*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to detect non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states by reducing the measurement requirements. It shows that a single quadrature homodyne detection is sufficient to certify any degree of non-Gaussianity, leveraging Hudson's theorem and compactness of state sets. The approach is noise robust and has favorable experimental prospects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of full quantum state tomography is prohibitive, so the paper focuses on certifying non-Gaussianity with fewer measurements, which is more practical for applications.

Method: The paper uses single quadrature measurements (homodyne detection) and applies Hudson's theorem involving wavefunction zeros and stellar rank to witness non-Gaussianity. They prove compactness of states with bounded energy and finite stellar rank for noise robustness.

Result: A single quadrature measurement can detect any non-Gaussianity level; the method is supported by technical compactness results ensuring robustness against noise. Results include sample complexity, noise resilience, and experimental feasibility.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies detection, requiring only one quadrature measurement, making it a more viable option for experiments and exploiting quantum advantages in non-Gaussian resources.

Abstract: Full reconstruction of quantum states from measurement samples is often a
prohibitively complex task, both in terms of the experimental setup and the
scaling of the sample size with the system. This motivates the relatively
easier task of certifying application-specific quantities using measurements
that are not tomographically complete, i.e. that provide only partial
information about the state related to the application of interest. Here, we
focus on simplifying the measurements needed to certify non-Gaussianity in
bosonic systems, a resource related to quantum advantage in various information
processing tasks. We show that the statistics of a single quadrature
measurement, corresponding to standard homodyne detection in quantum optics,
can witness arbitrary degrees of non-Gaussianity as quantified by stellar rank.
Our results are based on a version of Hudson's theorem for wavefunctions,
proved in a companion paper [1], revealing that the zeros in a homodyne
distribution are signatures of quantum non-Gaussianity and higher stellar
ranks. The validity of our witnesses is supported by a technical result showing
that sets of states with bounded energy and finite stellar rank are compact. We
provide an analysis of sample complexity, noise robustness, and experimental
prospects. Our work drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum
non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states. and experimental prospects. Our work

TL;DR: The study compares various neural network architectures for quantum state tomography, finding CNN and CGAN perform best with scalable hardware potential through memristor-based CiM platforms. However, SVAE has moderate performance and should be considered for low-power embedded systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state tomography is crucial for quantum system validation, but existing methods pose challenges due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space and measurement requirements. This study aims to address which neural architectures are effective and scalable for such tasks.

Method: The study benchmarked CNN, CGAN, and SVAE across different quantum measurement strategies, evaluating their impact on state reconstruction quality and scalability with increasing qubit numbers. Hardware acceleration via memristor-based CiM platforms was also considered.

Result: CNN and CGAN demonstrated superior scaling and fidelity, whereas SVAE performed adequately but with limitations suitable for specific hardware contexts. Memristor-based platforms enhance scalability for future quantum systems.

Conclusion: The research identifies effective architectures for scalable quantum state tomography and suggests hardware optimizations for future quantum computing advancements.

Abstract: Quantum State Tomography (QST) is essential for characterizing and validating
quantum systems, but its practical use is severely limited by the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space and the number of measurements required for
informational completeness. Many prior claims of performance have relied on
architectural assumptions rather than systematic validation. We benchmark
several neural network architectures to determine which scale effectively with
qubit number and which fail to maintain high fidelity as system size
increases.To address this, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking of diverse
neural architectures across two quantum measurement strategies to evaluate
their effectiveness in reconstructing both pure and mixed quantum states. Our
results reveal that CNN and CGAN scale more robustly and achieve the highest
fidelities, while Spiking Variational Autoencoder (SVAE) demonstrates moderate
fidelity performance, making it a strong candidate for embedded, low-power
hardware implementations.Recognizing that practical quantum diagnostics will
require embedded, energy-efficient computation, we also discuss how
memristor-based Computation-in-Memory (CiM) platforms can accelerate these
models in hardware, mitigating memory bottlenecks and reducing energy
consumption to enable scalable in-situ QST. This work identifies which
architectures scale favorably for future quantum systems and lays the
groundwork for quantum-classical co-design that is both computationally and
physically scalable.

*Melvin Mathews,Lukas Pahl,David Pahl,Vaishnavi L. Addala,Catherine Tang,William D. Oliver,Jeffrey A. Grover*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) with lower overheads by using hardware-aware layout algorithms, demonstrating significant reductions in hardware cost with open boundaries but also noting impacts on logical efficiency. Low-weight radial codes perform well despite lacking topological structure. An algorithm called HAL is developed for optimizing QECC layout and cost analysis. The paper concludes that HAL is a promising framework for both evaluating existing codes and guiding new code discovery in realistic quantum hardware environments. The main takeaway is that while reducing overheads is beneficial, it's essential to consider trade-offs between logical efficiency and hardware cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's focus on developing efficient quantum error correction codes resonates with the growing need for robust quantum computing solutions, especially as the number of qubits increases and the challenge of maintaining error rates grows. The authors tackle a significant problem in quantum computing by proposing a novel layout optimization algorithm, which not only reduces overheads but also considers practical hardware constraints, making the paper particularly relevant to researchers and developers working on scalable quantum architectures.

Method: The methodology involves several steps: first, the development of the Hardware-Aware Layout (HAL) algorithm, which automates and optimizes the placement and routing of QECCs. Second, the authors compare various families of QECCs—bivariate bicycle codes, open-boundary tile codes, and constant-depth-decodable radial codes—using the HAL algorithm to assess hardware costs. Third, they analyze the performance of the best-performing codes, particularly the low-weight radial codes, and evaluate how different hardware configurations (open vs. closed boundaries) affect both hardware cost and logical efficiency. The evaluation likely includes metrics such as cycle time, resource usage, and logical error rates.

Result: The key results show that the open-boundary tile codes and constant-depth-decodable radial codes achieve lower hardware costs compared to the bivariate bicycle codes with their respective topological structures. Low-weight radial codes, despite lacking traditional topological structures, perform well in terms of error correction capabilities. The HAL algorithm demonstrates robustness and efficiency in optimizing QECC layouts and minimizing hardware costs. Additionally, the study reveals that open boundaries reduce hardware costs but may come at the expense of logical efficiency. The optimal choice of code family depends on the specific trade-offs between hardware and logical performance, with each code excelling under different scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of Hardware-Aware Layout (HAL) as a powerful framework for evaluating the hardware feasibility of quantum error correction codes. It emphasizes that while achieving asymptotically lower overheads is a significant advancement, the practical implementation must balance hardware costs and maintaining logical efficiency. The findings suggest that the choice of QECC family and its implementation should be guided by the specific constraints and requirements of the underlying quantum hardware. HAL provides a valuable tool for optimizing QECC design and implementation, contributing to the development of scalable and reliable quantum computing architectures by guiding the discovery of new codes that better match realistic hardware conditions.

Abstract: Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) with asymptotically lower overheads
than the surface code require non-local connectivity. Leveraging multi-layer
routing and long-range coupling capabilities in superconducting qubit hardware,
we develop Hardware-Aware Layout, HAL: a robust, runtime-efficient heuristic
algorithm that automates and optimizes the placement and routing of arbitrary
QECCs. Using HAL, we perform a comparative study of hardware cost across
various families of QECCs, including the bivariate bicycle codes, the
open-boundary tile codes, and the constant-depth-decodable radial codes. The
layouts produced by HAL confirm that open boundaries significantly reduce the
hardware cost, while incurring reductions in logical efficiency. Among the
best-performing codes were low-weight radial codes, despite lacking topological
structure. Overall, HAL provides a valuable framework for evaluating the
hardware feasibility of existing QECCs and guiding the discovery of new codes
compatible with realistic hardware constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors explore new methods in quantum mechanics, specifically in defining and measuring time distributions, to address time-energy uncertainty principles. This is important because understanding time in quantum systems has been a challenge, especially in distributed and correlated systems.

Method: The paper uses projective measurements and population transfer rates to derive the time-of-flow distribution. They apply this framework to two different systems and derive specific uncertainty relations.

Result: The result is a time-energy uncertainty relation dependent on the measurement setup, which can be applied to various quantum systems and provides a practical way to measure time uncertainty.

Conclusion: This framework offers a unified approach to timing observables across different quantum systems and provides an experimentally accessible method to test quantum timing principles.

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time
distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The
time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a
measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form
$\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot
\delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This
bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that
time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the
framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy
uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent
driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and
matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing
quantum timing in controlled measurements.

Abstract: A scaled trapped-ion quantum computer will require efficient fluorescence
collection across a large area. Here we propose and demonstrate a compact
monolithically integrated system featuring a metalens fabricated on the
backside of a surface ion trap. A 40$\times$100 $\mu$m aperture enables a
simulated point-source collection efficiency of 0.91% and a measured
point-source detection efficiency of 0.58%. Increasing the aperture area to
40$\times$600 $\mu$m boosts the simulated collection efficiency to
3.17%$-$comparable to that of a conventional objective with a numerical
aperture of 0.35. Further improvements are possible by co-optimizing the
electrode and aperture geometry. An undercut of the electrode substrate at the
aperture ensures a large distance between the ion and dielectric substrate
without compromising collection efficiency. The metalens directly collimates
the collected fluorescence, eliminating the need for a high numerical aperture
objective. An array of such readout zones will offer a compact, scalable
solution for high-fidelity parallel readout in next-generation trapped-ion
quantum processors.

Abstract: In 2004, Cuccaro et al found a quantum-quantum adder with $O(n)$ gate cost
and $O(1)$ ancilla qubits. Since then, it's been an open question whether
classical-quantum adders can achieve the same asymptotic complexity. These
costs are particularly relevant to modular arithmetic circuits, which often
offset by the classically known modulus.
  In this paper, I construct an adder that uses 3 clean ancillae and $4n \pm
O(1)$ Toffoli gates to add a classical offset into a quantum register. I also
present an adder with a Toffoli cost of $3n \pm O(1)$ that uses 2 clean
ancillae and $n-2$ dirty ancillae. I further show that applying the presented
adders conditioned on a control qubit requires no additional workspace or
Toffolis.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 分析显示，进行随机后选择的粒子间距离测量可以影响多达几十个粒子的随机空间定位，同时保持宏观均匀性。最终所有粒子都会定位，定位长度的分布随测量速率变化，呈现熟悉的无量纲化形式。

Motivation: 研究粒子间相互作用的测量对系统行为的影响，有助于理解量子系统中的复杂动力学行为。

Method: 通过理论分析和数值模拟，研究后选择的测量对大量不同粒子系统的影响。

Conclusion: 后选择的邻近测量可以有效地引导大量粒子系统向有限数量的定位区域集中，同时保持整体的宏观均匀性。这种现象对于理解量子系统中的微观与宏观行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: Proximity measurements probe whether pairs of particles are close to one
another. We consider the impact of post-selected random proximity measurements
on a quantum fluid of many distinguishable particles. We show that such
measurements induce random spatial localization of a fraction of the particles,
and yet preserve homogeneity macroscopically. Eventually, all particles
localize, with a distribution of localization lengths that saturates at a scale
controlled by the typical measurement rate. The steady-state distribution of
these lengths is governed by a familiar scaling form.

*Karol Horodecki,Marek Winczewski,Leonard Sikorski,Paweł Mazurek,Mikołaj Czechlewski,Raja Yehia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework to measure the fundamental energy cost of generating quantum entanglement using noisy channels, defining a lower and upper bound for the energy required, and applies this to evaluate existing protocols for photon-based quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a method to quantify and understand the energy needs in quantum computing and communication, focusing on the irreversibility of quantum entanglement.

Method: The paper uses an axiomatic framework to define an energy cost measure, models quantum operations with classical control, formulates a Hamiltonian protocol, and derives bounds. It applies this to evaluate three entanglement distillation protocols for photonic systems.

Result: The study finds that the energy required for existing protocols exceeds the fundamental lower bound by many orders of magnitude, indicating significant potential for optimization.

Conclusion: The framework provides new insights into the energy costs of distributed quantum computing and communication, suggesting that the energy barriers for efficient resource distribution are substantial.

Abstract: Inspired by environmental sciences, we develop a framework to quantify the
energy needed to generate quantum entanglement via noisy quantum channels,
focusing on the hardware-independent, i.e. fundamental cost. Within this
framework, we define a measure of the minimal fundamental energy consumption
rate per distributed entanglement (expressed in Joule per ebit). We then derive
a lower bound on the energy cost of distributing a maximally entangled state
via a quantum channel, which yields a quantitative estimate of energy
investment per entangled bit for future quantum networks. We thereby show that
irreversibility in entanglement theory implies a non-zero energy cost in
standard entanglement distribution protocols. We further establish an upper
bound on the fundamental energy consumption rate of entanglement distribution
by determining the minimal energy required to implement quantum operations via
classical control. To this end, we formulate the axioms for an energy cost
measure and introduce a Hamiltonian model for classically-controlled quantum
operations. The fundamental cost is then defined as the infimum energy over all
such Hamiltonian protocols, with or without specific hardware constraints. The
study of the energy cost of a quantum operation is general enough to be
naturally applicable to quantum computing and is of independent interest.
Finally, we evaluate the energy demands of three entanglement distillation
protocols for photonic polarization qubits, finding that, due to entanglement
irreversibility, their required energy exceeds the fundamental lower bound by
many orders of magnitude. The introduced paradigm can be applied to other
quantum resources, with appropriate changes depending on their nature.

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a critical step in continuous-variable quantum key
distribution (CV-QKD), especially in the finite-size regime where worst-case
confidence intervals can significantly reduce the achievable secret-key rate.
We provide a finite-size security analysis demonstrating that neural networks
can be reliably employed for parameter estimation in CV-QKD with quantifiable
failure probabilities $\epsilon_{PE}$, endowed with an operational
interpretation and composable security guarantees. Using a protocol that is
operationally equivalent to standard approaches, our method produces
significantly tighter confidence intervals, unlocking higher key rates even
under collective Gaussian attacks. The proposed approach yields tighter
confidence intervals, leading to a quantifiable increase in the secret-key rate
under collective Gaussian attacks. These results open up new perspectives for
integrating modern machine learning techniques into quantum cryptographic
protocols, particularly in practical resource-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 从量子计算角度看，抗噪声是一个关键问题，尤其是非阿贝尔TO在量子信息保护中的重要性，因此研究其抗噪声能力意义重大。

Method: 利用非阿贝尔任意子的非确定性融合实现主动去噪，建立统计力学模型，应用贝叶斯推断确定最优阈值。

Result: 非阿贝尔TO的抗噪声阈值显著高于阿贝尔TO，验证了主动去噪方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 非阿贝尔TO通过 active error correction 显著增强了抗噪声能力，为量子纠错提供了新思路。

Abstract: Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and
manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been
systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the
non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error
correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag
qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over
those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian
anyon type. Furthermore, we present an approach for determining the optimal
threshold for non-Abelian TOs with perfect anyon syndromes for any noise model,
formulated as a statistical mechanics model using Bayesian inference. We
numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb
Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome
measurement, we find an optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an
intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already
gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$.
Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather
than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault
tolerance.

Abstract: The advancement and scaling of quantum technology has made the learning and
identification of quantum systems and devices in highly-multidimensional
parameter spaces a pressing task for a variety of applications. In many cases,
the integration of real-time feedback control and adaptive choice of
measurement settings places strict demands on the speed of this task. Here we
present a joint model selection and parameter estimation algorithm that is fast
and operable on a large number of model parameters. The algorithm is based on
variational Bayesian inference (VBI), which approximates the target posterior
distribution by optimizing a tractable family of distributions, making it more
scalable than exact inference methods relying on sampling and that generally
suffer from high variance and computational cost in high-dimensional spaces. We
show how a regularizing prior can be used to select between competing models,
each comprising a different number of parameters, identifying the simplest
model that explains the experimental data. The regularization can further
separate the degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum systems in the environment or
processes, which contribute to major features in the observed dynamics, with
respect to others featuring small coupling, which only contribute to a
background. As an application of the introduced framework, we consider the
problem of the identification of multiple individual nuclear spins with a
single electron spin quantum sensor, relevant for nanoscale nuclear magnetic
resonance. With the number of environmental spins unknown a priori, our
Bayesian approach is able to correctly identify the model, i.e. the number of
spins and their couplings. We benchmark the algorithm on both simulated and
experimental data, using standard figures of merit, and demonstrating that we
can estimate dozens of parameters within minutes.

Motivation: The paper is about understanding decoherence mechanisms in quantum systems, specifically in organic molecular crystals, which is crucial for developing quantum technologies.

Method: Monte Carlo analysis is used to model the effects of exciton hopping and magnetic fields on quantum beats.

Result: The study shows how decoherence can suppress or alter fluorescence quantum beats depending on hopping rates and magnetic field strength, highlighting the factors influencing quantum interference.

Conclusion: The findings provide a framework for controlling quantum beats by adjusting system parameters, which is essential for quantum devices reliant on these phenomena.

Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals
are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice
sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon
triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a
function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis.
Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global
decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero
magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates
depending on magnetic field strength.

Result: Experiments demonstrate OQTOPUS's effectiveness in improving quantum computing system performance.

Conclusion: OQTOPUS helps lower the entry barrier for quantum computing and supports developing a community of quantum computer developers.

Abstract: Since the late 2010s, quantum computers have become commercially available,
and the number of services that users can run remotely via cloud servers is
increasing. In Japan, several domestic superconducting quantum computing
systems, including our own, began operation in 2023. However, the design of
quantum computing systems, especially in the most critical areas near quantum
computers, remains largely undisclosed, creating a significant barrier to entry
into the quantum computing field. If this situation continues, progress toward
standardization, which is essential for guiding quantum computer development,
will stall, and it will be difficult to develop a practical quantum computing
system that can perform calculations on a supercomputer scale. To address this
issue, we propose Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators and USers (OQTOPUS), a
full-stack quantum computing system developed from research with real quantum
computers. OQTOPUS is one of the world's largest open-source software projects,
covering operational software from cloud-based execution environment
construction to system operation. Furthermore, to perform quantum computing
effectively and efficiently, it implements key features, such as transpilers,
multiprogramming, and error mitigation, in an area as close as possible to a
quantum computer, an area that system vendors rarely disclose. Finally, this
study presents experimental results of applying OQTOPUS to a real quantum
computer. OQTOPUS is publicly available on GitHub and will notably lower the
barrier to entry into the quantum computing field, contributing to the
formation of a quantum computing developer community through open discussion.

Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an
emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of
geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches,
we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with
dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to
define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between
static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how
gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct
Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining
Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector
potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations
explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity
and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological
charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space,
and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like
expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime
of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and
time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications
extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of
phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems
driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI QKD) offers unparalleled
cryptographic security by eliminating trust requirements for quantum devices,
yet has remained impractical for long-distance implementation due to
fundamental rate limitations. Here, we propose the first experimentally viable
schemes for long-distance DI QKD using two fully photonic approaches with
heralded entanglement distribution using spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC) sources. Both schemes achieve key rate scaling with the square root of
channel transmissivity $\eta_t$, matching the twin-field protocol advantage
rather than the prohibitive linear decay of conventional QKD. We demonstrate
positive key rates at detector efficiencies as low as 83\%, bringing DI QKD
within reach of the current superconducting detector technology. Our security
analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem to establish rigorous
finite-size bounds, while numerical optimization yields custom Bell
certificates that surpass standard approaches by 2--3 times at maximum
transmission distances. This work represents a critical milestone toward
device-independent security in quantum communication networks, providing
experimentalists with practical implementation pathways while maintaining the
strongest possible security guarantees against quantum adversaries.

Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising
quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable
color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of
4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for
integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. However, the deterministic
integration of single spin defects into high-performance photonic cavities on
this platform has remained a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the
deterministic and scalable coupling of both ensemble (PL4) and single PL6 spin
defects into monolithic bullseye cavities on the 4H-SiCOI platform. By tuning
the cavity resonance, we achieve a 40-fold enhancement of the zero-phonon line
(ZPL) intensity from ensemble PL4 defects, corresponding to a Purcell factor of
approximately 5.0. For deterministically coupled single PL6 defects, we observe
a threefold increase in the saturated photon count rate, confirm single-photon
emission, and demonstrate coherent control of the spin state through optically
detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), resonant excitation, and Rabi oscillations.
These advancements establish a viable pathway for developing scalable,
high-performance SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.

Abstract: This paper presents strategies for enhancing the robustness of bidirectional
quantum teleportation (BQT) through environment-assisted and weak measurement
techniques. BQT is a crucial component of distributed quantum networks,
allowing for the bilateral transfer of quantum information between two nodes.
While perfect teleportation necessitates maximally entangled states, these are
vulnerable to degradation due to inherent decoherence. We propose a BQT scheme
that enables the bilateral transfer of arbitrary qubits between nodes via
amplitude damping channels (ADC), aiming to optimize fidelity using weak
measurements in the final step of the process. Environment-assisted
measurements (EAM) are used to establish a four-qubit channel composed of two
Bell states. We explore two situations: (I) where only the recovery qubits pass
through amplitude damping channels and (II) where the entire four-qubit channel
is subjected to ADC. Our findings demonstrate a balance between average
fidelity and success probability when the weak measurement strength ($q_w$) is
constrained by the decay rate ($p$), specifically $q_w \in {[0,p]}$. Perfect
BQT is achieved when $q_w = p$, indicating complete suppression of ADC effects.
On the other hand, a decline in both average fidelity and success probability
is noted when the weak measurement strength surpasses the ADC strength, marking
the prohibited domain as $q_w \in {(p,1]}$. Additionally, our secured BQT
protocol consistently outperforms the unprotected scheme in both scenarios,
highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed protection strategies.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement enables exponential computational states, while
superposition provides inherent parallelism. Consequently, quantum circuits are
theoretically capable of supporting large scale parallel computation. However,
applying them to financial analysis particularly in the areas of random number
generation and payoff computation remains a significant challenge. Experts
generally believe that quantum computing relies on matrix operations, which are
deterministic in nature without randomness. This inherent determinism makes it
particularly challenging to design quantum circuits that require random number
injection. JP Morgan[1] introduced the piecewise linear (PWL) approach for
modeling payoff computations but did not disclose a quantum circuit capable of
identifying values exceeding the strike price, suggesting a possible reliance
on classical pre processing for interval classification. This paper presents an
integrated quantum circuit with two key components: one for random number
injection, applicable to risk assessment, and the other for direct payoff
computation, relevant to financial pricing. These components are compatible
with a scalable framework that leverages large scale parallelism and Quantum
Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to achieve quadratic speedup. The circuit was
implemented on IBM Qiskit and evaluated using 8 parallel threads and 1600
measurement shots. Results confirmed both the presence of randomness and the
correctness of payoff computation. While the current implementation uses 8
threads, the design scales to 2 to the power of n threads, for arbitrarily
large n, offering a potential path toward demonstrating quantum supremacy.

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a crucial technique for suppressing errors
especially in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, enabling more reliable
quantum computation without the overhead of full error correction. Zero-Noise
Extrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent
quantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as
iterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's
effectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based
on such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires
substantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight,
extrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum
algorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method
characterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the
full algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the
block fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success
probability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's
algorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real
127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise
environment. Our results, particularly those from Aer simulator, demonstrate
that the core block's error follows a highly consistent exponential decay. This
allows our technique to achieve robust error mitigation, overcoming the
limitations of conventional ZNE which is often compromised by statistically
unreliable data from near-random behavior under heavy noise. In low-noise
conditions, our method approaches theoretical success probability, outperforms
ZNE. In high-noise conditions, ZNE fails to mitigate errors due to overfitting
of its extrapolation data, whereas our method achieves over a 20% higher
success probability.

*Simone Artini,Gabriele Lo Monaco,Alberto Imparato,Mauro Paternostro,Sandro Donadi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper compares different quantum Brownian motion models, finding that while some have issues with thermodynamics, others create issues like violating detailed balance even when they should maintain equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how quantum systems interact with their environment thermodynamically is crucial for developing quantum technologies and theories.

Method: The paper uses stochastic thermodynamics and the Caldeira-Leggett master equation to analyze quantum Brownian motion models, evaluating their thermodynamic consistency.

Result: Some models fail quantum mechanical consistency or introduce thermodynamic anomalies that complicate understanding of non-equilibrium systems.

Conclusion: There's a fundamental conflict between maintaining quantum consistency and achieving thermodynamic equilibrium in open quantum systems, impacting the reliability of these models.

Abstract: We rigorously analyze the non-equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of various
formulations of quantum Brownian motion (QBM) using the framework of stochastic
thermodynamics. While the widely used Caldeira-Leggett master equation exhibits
desirable thermodynamic features, such as the fulfilment of a detailed balance,
it fails to ensure complete positivity. In contrast, several completely
positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) extensions turn out to be
thermodynamically controversial. We show that such extensions introduce
anomalous phase-space structures that violate detailed balance at the steady
state, leading to non-vanishing entropy production and effective
non-equilibrium current of unclear physical origins. Our results highlight a
fundamental tension between quantum consistency and thermodynamic equilibration
in open quantum systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fully passive CV-QKD protocol that eliminates modulator side channels, achieves 100 km transmission, 1 GHz repetition rate, and 127 kbps secret key rate. It performs similarly to modulated CV-LLO protocols and better than passive ones, suitable for quantum networks. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the challenge of quantum key distribution (QKD) with passive systems, which is essential for realistic and large-scale quantum networks. They aim to avoid the use of modulators to eliminate potential side channels, enhancing security. 

Method: The protocol uses a local oscillator (LLO) and discrete-state continuous-variable states. Phase rotation and discretization methods are employed, along with convex optimization based on quadrature moments, to achieve the desired performance without modulators. 

Result: The system achieves 100 km transmission at 1 GHz, with a secret key rate of 127 kbps, surpassing passive CV and discrete-variable protocols while performing similarly to modulated CV-LLO protocols. 

Conclusion: This protocol is a significant advancement in passive CV-QKD, offering a viable solution for quantum networks with realistic security and practical implementation. It enables quantum metropolitan area networks and quantum access networks, contributing to scalable and secure quantum communication systems.

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a fully passive discrete-state continuous-variable
quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), which can eliminate all modulator side
channels on the source side, using a local local oscillator (LLO). The CV-QKD
system achieves a maximum transmission length of 100 km with a repetition rate
of 1 GHz using specially designed phase rotation and discretization methods,
and the corresponding secret key bit rate is 127 kbps, as estimated based on
the amplitude of prepared states at the transmitter, as well as the first- and
second-order moments of quadratures at the receiver by employing the convex
optimization without imposing any assumptions on the quantum channel. The
performance of the protocol is similar to that of modulated CV LLO protocols
and better than those of passive discrete-variable and CV protocols. Our
protocol is expected to play an important role in the quantum metropolitan area
networks and quantum access networks with high realistic security.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，量子增强的机器学习逐渐成为解决复杂高维数据分类问题的重要工具。然而，理解量子学习模型中的泛化机制仍然存在很多挑战，特别是多分类任务中的行为尚不完全清楚。

Method: 研究利用矩阵乘积态（MPS）分类器在三个分类任务中进行性能分析，分别使用了时尚 MNIST 数据集和高光谱卫星图像数据集。研究通过跟踪训练过程中的纠缠熵、局部磁化和模型性能来观察 'grokking' 现象。此外，应用了信息论工具，如转移熵分析标签特定的量子掩码之间的因果关系，以及利用 O-信息量量化类输出之间的协同与冗余信息变化。

Conclusion: 这些研究结果强调了量子增强学习在分类任务中的潜力，并通过高阶信息动态模型提供了一种分析量子学习架构泛化机制的新方法。特别是在多分类场景中，理解标签相关性和纠缠特征对于优化量子学习算法至关重要。

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced machine learning, encompassing both quantum algorithms and
quantum-inspired classical methods such as tensor networks, offers promising
tools for extracting structure from complex, high-dimensional data. In this
work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers
applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyper-spectral
satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of
grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking
entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across
training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain
deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between
label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from
synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show
that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement
transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted
hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings
highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired
learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in
multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret
generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.

operators, spin operators, or any other operators, which is realized by
defining generalized correlation matrices. Particular cases of entanglement
production are considered.

### [73] [Universal tradeoff relations between resource cost and irreversibility of channels: General-resource Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorems and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23760)
*Hiroyasu Tajima,Koji Yamaguchi,Ryuji Takagi,Yui Kuramochi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum technologies have high potential, but implementing quantum processes costs resources. The paper introduces a trade-off between irreversibility and resource cost, applicable to many types of resources. This trade-off is universally applicable and leads to several new findings about energy, work, measurement, and resource costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses fundamental aspects of quantum resource theories, focusing on the irreversibility of quantum processes and their associated costs. This is relevant to quantum technologies and has implications for understanding the limits and possibilities of quantum computing and information processing.

Method: The approach uses formal proofs within quantum resource theories to establish the trade-off law. The method is grounded in mathematical proofs based on axioms of quantum resource theories.

Result: The trade-off law provides a framework for understanding resource costs and irreversibility, leading to specific results like energy-error tradeoffs, new resource cost bounds, and extensions of existing theorems.

Conclusion: The trade-off framework helps clarify when quantum resources can suppress irreversibility and offers a foundation for developing quantum technologies by linking irreversibility and resource costs.

Abstract: Quantum technologies offer exceptional -- sometimes almost magical -- speed
and performance, yet every quantum process costs physical resources. Designing
next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following
question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a
desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum
resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the
lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required
resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of
resources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others --
yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope
positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results:
(1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the
irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff
for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to
free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem,
which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a
wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing
resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource
cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in
fact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal
relationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step
toward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can
suppress irreversibility.

Conclusion: 通过使用不信任的卫星节点，双场和模式配对量子密钥分发协议展示了在20厘米地物望远镜下的高效密钥分发潜力，扩展了全球量子网络的覆盖范围和安全性。

Abstract: In pursuit of a global quantum key distribution (QKD) network, a service
based on untrusted nodes on geostationary satellites could offer wide coverage,
continuous operation, and enhanced security compared to the trusted node
alternative. Although this scenario has been studied for entanglement-based
protocols, such an approach would require large-area telescopes both on the
ground and in space. In this work, we analyze the performance of two QKD
protocols well adapted to this scenario, namely twin-field (TF) and
mode-pairing (MP) QKD, which exhibit high resilience to high-loss channels.
Leveraging an in-depth simulation of communication channels corrected with
adaptive optics, we assess the expected secret key rates for both protocols in
a configuration involving two 50 cm telescopes on board the satellite and
ground-based telescopes ranging from 20 cm to 1 m in aperture. Our results show
that, in the best case and considering realistic detectors, it is possible to
achieve secret key rates on the order of a few hundred bit/s for both TF and
MP-QKD. We show, notably, that secret key generation is potentially feasible
even with 20 cm ground telescopes, highlighting the high scalability potential
of such a configuration.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger wavefunction is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics, quantum
chemistry, and bosonic quantum information theory. Its zero-set for fermionic
systems is well-studied and central for determining chemical properties, yet
for bosonic systems the zero-set is less understood, especially in the context
of characterizing non-classicality. Here we study the zeros of such
wavefunctions and give them a novel information-theoretic interpretation. Our
main technical result is showing that the wavefunction of most bosonic quantum
systems can be extended to a holomorphic function over the complex plane,
allowing the application of powerful techniques from complex analysis. As a
consequence, we prove a version of Hudson's theorem for the wavefunction and
characterize Gaussian dynamics as classical motion of the wavefunction zeros.
Our findings suggest that the non-Gaussianity of quantum optical states can be
detected by measuring a single quadrature of the electromagnetic field, which
we demonstrate in a companion paper [1]. More generally, our results show that
the non-Gaussian features of bosonic quantum systems are encoded in the zeros
of their wavefunction.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive classification of one-dimensional coined quantum
walks on the infinite line, focusing on the spatial probability distributions
they induce. Building on prior results, we identify all initial coin states
that lead to symmetric quantum walks for arbitrary coins, and provide a
bijective parametrisation of all symmetric quantum walks modulo distributional
equivalence. Extending beyond the symmetric case, we also give a surjective
parametrisation of all coined quantum walks under the same equivalence relation
and a bijective parametrisation modulo equivalence of the walks' limiting
distributions.
  Furthermore, we derive corrected closed-form expressions for the walk
amplitudes, resolving inaccuracies in previous literature, and generalise the
approach to the correlated classical random walk. This unified framework
enables a direct comparison between quantum and classical dynamics.
Additionally, we discuss the asymptotic scaling of variances for both models,
identifying quadratic spreading as a hallmark of non-trivial quantum walks and
contrasting it with the linear behaviour of classical walks, except at the
extremal points of maximal correlation. Finally, we compare the limiting
distributions arising from quantum walks with the ones in the classical case.

Result: An 8.1-fold enhancement in signal photon rate and tight constraint on the dark photon kinetic mixing angle.

Conclusion: The method shows promising advancements in quantum-enhanced dark matter searches.

Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitive dark matter detection, particularly using
nonclassical states, such as Schr\"odinger cat states featuring sub-Planck
interference structures in microwave cavities. Here, we report the first
experimental application of four-component Schr\"odinger cat states within a
high-quality superconducting microwave cavity to detect dark photons, a
potential dark matter candidate. We demonstrate an 8.1-fold enhancement in the
signal photon rate and constrain the dark photon kinetic mixing angle to an
unprecedented $\epsilon < 7.32 \times 10^{-16}$ near 6.44~GHz (26.6~$\mu$eV).
By employing a parametric sideband drive to actively tune the cavity frequency,
we achieve dark photon searches and background subtraction across multiple
frequency bins, yielding a sensitivity at the $10^{-16}$ level within a 100~kHz
bandwidth. Our Schr\"odinger's cat-assisted detection (SCaD) scheme
demonstrates a substantial improvement over previous results, promising
potential implications in quantum-enhanced searches for new physics.

Abstract: Topological manipulation of light provides a versatile toolbox for photonic
technologies. Here, we show that a topological atom array can induce photon
localization in a waveguide via symmetry-protected light-matter interaction.
Long-lived photon-atom entanglement reveals the existence of a novel
topological quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC). This hybrid
light-matter quasi-BIC is formed at a critical coupling condition via
collectively induced absorption, which is produced by quantum interference
between edge and bulk states. We uncover the time-reversed relation between
topological quasi-BIC and light amplification. Interestingly, one can realize a
directional ultranarrow amplifier by means of critical coupling. Our work
demonstrates an unconventional quasi-BIC at a topological quantum optics
interface with potential applications in quantum devices.

Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum
mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally
compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg
quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that
in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can
still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized
(non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution.
They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures
on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups.
We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with
the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a
compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian
groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The existence of electromagnetic radiation - radio-waves, microwaves, light,
x-rays and so on - is one of the most important physical phenomena, and our
ability to manipulate them is one of the most significant technological
achievement of humankind. Underlying this ability is our understanding of how
radiation is produced: whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates.
Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here we
prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without
radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple
(once one knows what to do) but its reasons are deep: it relies on the fact
that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act
on them, via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here
is just them tip of an iceberg - it implies the need to reconsider the basic
understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far
beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.

Abstract: Efficient parametrizations of quantum states are essential for trainable
hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. A key challenge in their design consists
in adapting to the available qubit connectivity of the quantum processor, which
limits the capacity to generate correlations between distant qubits in a
resource-efficient and trainable manner. In this work we first introduce an
algorithm that optimizes qubit routing for arbitrary connectivity graphs,
resulting in a swap network that enables direct interactions between any pair
of qubits. We then propose a co-design of circuit layers and qubit routing by
embedding the derived swap networks within layered, connectivity-aware
ans\"atze. This construction significantly improves the trainability of the
ansatz, leading to enhanced performance with reduced resources. We showcase
these improvements through ground-state simulations of strongly correlated
systems, including spin-glass and molecular electronic structure models. Across
exemplified connectivities, the swap-enhanced ansatz consistently achieves
lower energy errors using fewer entangling gates, shallower circuits, and fewer
parameters than standard layered-structured baselines. Our results indicate
that swap network augmented ans\"atze provide enhanced trainability and
resource-efficient design to capture complex correlations on devices with
constrained qubit connectivity.

Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the
average degree, hub density, and the number of closed paths of fixed length,
can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we
demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes
can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time
measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire
network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum
reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a
non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new
strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a fundamental quantum algorithm with applications in various fields such as chemistry, material science, and medicine. Researchers are actively seeking to improve its efficiency and applicability, leading to the development of new algorithms like theSandwich test to address limitations in the traditional approaches. This paper contributes to the field by proposing a novel method that reduces computational complexity, making QPE more feasible for practical use cases. Quantum位估计（QPE）是一种基础量子算法，应用于化学、材料科学和医学等领域。 研究者们致力于提高其效率和适用性，导致提出像 sandwiches测试这样的新型方法，以弥补传统方法的缺陷。 本文通过提出降低计算复杂度的方法，使 QPE 更可行用于实际应用，对领域的发展有贡献。

Method:  The paper introduces the SANDWICH test as an improvement over the Sequential Hadamard test (SHT) for Quantum Phase Estimation. It involves sandwiching the SPROTIS operator between controlled applications of U^a and U^b, where a and b are integers less than or equal to k. The implementation requires the efficient preparation of the initial state |ψ⟩ and estimates the expectation value ⟨ψ|U^k|ψ⟩. The runtime complexity is analyzed, showing that the new method scales with an improved time complexity compared to SHT. 这篇文章介绍了 sandwiches测试作为sequential hadamard测试的改进方法，用于量子位估计。 它涉及用 U^a 和 U^b 的控制应用将 spritos 运算符夹在中间，其中 a 和 b 是小于或等于 k 的整数。 它需要有效地准备初始状态 |ψ⟩，并估计期望值 ⟨ψ|U^k|ψ⟩。 利用新的方法，运行时间复杂度得到改进，相较于 SHT，新的方法具有更好的时间复杂度。

Result:  The SANDWICH test reduces the total run time complexity from O(k^3/(ε^2 r_min^2)) for the SHT to O(k² ln k / (ε² s_min^6)) for the new method. Here, s_min is the minimum value among all paths in a random binary sum tree with root node k and leaves as 0 or 1. This significant reduction in time complexity makes the quantum algorithm more efficient and practical for real-world applications. sandwiches测试将总运行时间从 SHT 的 O(k^3/(ε^2 r_min^2)) 降低到 O(k² ln k / (ε² s_min^6))。 其中，s_min 是随机二叉求和树上根节点为 k，叶子为 0 或 1 的所有路径中的最小值。 这种时间复杂度的显著降低使量子算法更加高效和适用于实际应用。

Conclusion: The SANDWICH test represents a significant advancement in Quantum Phase Estimation by offering a more efficient implementation. This breakthrough allows QPE to be more practical for solving complex problems in medicine, materials science, and other areas where efficient quantum algorithms are crucial. sandwiches测试代表了量子位估计的重要进步，因为它提供了一种更有效的实现方法。这一突破使 QPE 更加适用于医学、材料科学等需要高效量子算法解决复杂问题的领域。

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) has potential for a scientific revolution
through numerous practical applications like finding better medicines,
batteries, materials, catalysts etc. Many QPE algorithms use the Hadamard test
to estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$ for a large integer $k$ for an
efficiently preparable initial state $|\psi\rangle$ and an efficiently
implementable unitary operator $U$. The Hadamard test is hard to implement
because it requires controlled applications of $U^{k}$. Recently, a Sequential
Hadamard test (SHT) was proposed (arXiv:2506.18765) which requires controlled
application of $U$ only but its total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ scales as
$\mathcal{O}(k^{3}/\epsilon^{2}r_{\rm min}^{2})$ where $r_{\rm min}$ is the
minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{k'}|\psi\rangle|$ among all integers $k'
\leq k$. Typically $r_{\rm min}$ is exponentially low and SHT becomes too slow.
We present a new algorithm, the SANDWICH test to address this bottleneck. Our
algorithm uses efficient preparation of the initial state $|\psi\rangle$ to
efficiently implement the SPROTIS operator $R_{\psi}^{\phi}$ where SPROTIS
stands for the Selective Phase Rotation of the Initial State. It sandwiches the
SPROTIS operator between $U^{a}$ and $U^{b}$ for integers $\{a,b\} \leq k$ to
estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$. The total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ is
$\mathcal{O}(k^{2}\ln k/ \epsilon^{2} s_{\rm min}^{6})$. Here $s_{\rm min}$ is
the minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{\hat{k}}|\psi\rangle$ among all integers
$\hat{k}$ which are values of the nodes of a random binary sum tree whose root
node value is $k$ and leaf nodes' values are $1$ or $0$. It can be reasonably
expected that $s_{\rm min} \not\ll 1$ in typical cases because there is wide
freedom in choosing the random binary sum tree.

### [84] [Amplitude amplification and estimation require inverses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23787)
*Ewin Tang,John Wright*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper shows that quantum speedups for certain problems only work if the process can be inverted, challenging the idea that quantum speedups are abundant in many settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the conditions under which quantum speedups are achievable is crucial for advancing quantum computing applications and algorithms.

Method: The paper uses the compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry to analyze amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation algorithms. They construct problem instances where only with invertible processes can speedups be achieved.

Result: The authors demonstrate that specific quantum algorithms provide speedups only when the inverse process is accessible, and otherwise, the naive approach is more efficient.

Conclusion: This finding challenges the common belief that quantum speedups are widespread in various fields like machine learning, metrology, and sensing, emphasizing the importance of reversible processes in quantum algorithms.

Abstract: We prove that the generic quantum speedups for brute-force search and
counting only hold when the process we apply them to can be efficiently
inverted. The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification
and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation
unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$; we give problem instances based on
trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only $U$ beats the naive,
quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the
compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are
responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum
algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in
the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings,
$U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$
can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our
result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are
scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound.

### [85] [Could Living Cells Use Phase Transitions to Process Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23384)
*Arvind Murugan,David Zwicker,Charlotta Lorenz,Eric R. Dufresne*

TL;DR: The paper argues that biomolecular condensation in cells can perform computational tasks similar to physical computing, suggesting implications for expressivity and learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract presents an exciting exploration of biomolecular condensation's role in cellular information processing, linking it to computational tasks and the emerging field of physical computing.

Method: The paper discusses theoretical analysis and physical demonstrations of biomolecular condensation processes, potentially using experimental validation and simulations.

Result:  It suggests that biomolecular condensation can be used to perform complex computations and highlights active research areas in physical computing.

Conclusion: The study opens up new research directions by integrating physical computing concepts with cellular biology, emphasizing the potential for biophysical systems to perform advanced computations.

Abstract: To maintain homeostasis, living cells process information with networks of
interacting molecules. Traditional models for cellular information processing
have focused on networks of chemical reactions between molecules. Here, we
describe how networks of physical interactions could contribute to the
processing of information inside cells. In particular, we focus on the impact
of biomolecular condensation, a structural phase transition found in cells.
Biomolecular condensation has recently been implicated in diverse cellular
processes. Some of these are essentially computational, including
classification and control tasks. We place these findings in the broader
context of physical computing, an emerging framework for describing how the
native dynamics of nonlinear physical systems can be leveraged to perform
complex computations. The synthesis of these ideas raises questions about
expressivity (the range of problems that cellular phase transitions might be
able to solve) and learning (how these systems could adapt and evolve to solve
different problems). This emerging area of research presents diverse
opportunities across molecular biophysics, soft matter, and physical computing.

*Saito Sakaguchi,Basil Duvernoy,Anders Fridberger,Håkan Olausson,Sarah McIntyre*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the factors influencing individual differences in tactile perception by studying skin mechanics using fOCT. They used a custom system to capture skin displacement in response to brushing, showing each layer reacts differently, suggesting internal dynamics play a role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variation in how people perceive even simple tactile stimuli is significant. To understand why, the authors focused on how mechanical events are transmitted through the skin, using fOCT for detailed measurements.

Method: fOCT is used to measure skin displacement at different depths during brushing. The system captures real-time, high-frequency data with sub-surface imaging.

Result: Each skin layer responds uniquely to the brushing stimulus, indicating that internal skin dynamics are crucial in tactile perception.

Conclusion: The findings offer a new approach to study the relationship between mechanical events and sensory function in the skin, which could contribute to understanding tactile perception variations.

Abstract: Even simple tactile stimuli can lead to remarkably different perceptions
among individuals, both in intensity and pleasantness. To understand the
physical factors behind this variation, it is important to investigate how
mechanical events are transmitted through the skin. In this study, we visualize
the internal skin strains in response to soft brushing stimuli using functional
Optical Coherence Tomography (fOCT), which provides depth-resolved time-series
data of the displacement of the skin. Driven with custom-made software, the
system enabled sub-surface imaging at a refresh rate of 10 kHz. Brushing was
applied to the back of the hand, and skin displacement was observed at
different depths. The results show that each skin layer responds differently to
the stimulus, suggesting that internal skin dynamics play a role in tactile
perception. This method offers a way to investigate how mechanical events
within the skin relate to sensory function.

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The study shows Ostwald ripening is absent in living cells away from equilibrium, potentially stabilizing droplets in such environments using molecular dynamics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the absence of Ostwald ripening in cells, which could explain how droplets in living systems are stabilized, contributing to cell biology and material science.

Method: Molecular dynamics simulations using central potentials in different equilibrium states were conducted to observe droplet behavior.

Result: Ostwald ripening is observed to be absent away from equilibrium, suggesting droplet stabilization mechanisms in living cells.

Conclusion: The findings imply that non-equilibrium conditions help maintain droplet stability in living cells, which is critical for various biological and material processes.

Abstract: Absence of Ostwald ripening has been observed in living cells, which operate
out of equilibrium. Using molecular dynamics we study the behaviour of liquid
droplets away from equilibrium in a system of particles interacting with each
other via several central potential. The system is driven out of equilibrium
either by the particles randomly transitioning between two states, or by
randomly changing their momenta. In all cases Ostwald ripening is absent only
away from equilibrium. This phenomena, might be the mechanism by which droplets
in living cells are stabilized.

Abstract: In the present paper, a hierarchy of the mKdV equation is integrated by the
methods of algebraic geometry. The mKdV hierarchy in question arises on
coadjoint orbits in the loop algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$, and employs a
family of hyperelliptic curves as spectral curves. A generic form of the
finite-gap solution in any genus is obtained in terms of the $\wp$-functions,
which generalize the Weierstrass $\wp$-function. Reality conditions for
quasi-periodic wave solutions are completely specified. The obtained solutions
are illustrated by plots in small genera.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to correct wavefront biases in atom interferometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about reducing systematic uncertainties in atom interferometry which are crucial for precision measurements.

Method: The method involves introducing controllable curvature to measure the phase curvature and correct wavefront bias.

Result: Achieved 1 mrad uncertainty in measuring phase curvature.

Conclusion: Potential to reduce wavefront bias uncertainty to improve gravimeter accuracy to the nm/s² level.

Abstract: Wavefront distortions are a leading source of systematic uncertainty in
light-pulse atom interferom- etry, limiting absolute measurements of
gravitational acceleration at the 30 nm/s$^2$ level. Here, we demonstrate in
situ spatially resolved measurement of the interferometer phase in a
Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer as a tool to characterize and correct
wavefront bias. By introducing controllable curvature of the Raman light using
an adjustable collimation retro-reflector, we show that the bias due to
parabolic wavefront curvature can be measured with 1 mrad uncertainty and that
finite-size corrections impact the measured phase curvature. This measurement
process could be adopted in optimized atom interferometer gravimeters to reduce
wavefront bias uncertainty below the nm/s$^2$ level.

Abstract: We demonstrate a quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source achieved
without the use of a high-finesse cavity-locked laser. Our frequency reference
is based on a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb that enables
sub-kHz linewidths. The long-term stability of the comb is defined by an
external RF reference: either a 10 MHz RF signal from the Dutch Metrology
Institute (VSL), or a tunable RF source whose long-term stability is maintained
by monitoring and stabilizing the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical
trap (MOT). The comb-stabilized system is benchmarked against a conventional
cavity-locked laser and achieves comparable performance in broadband and
single-frequency MOTs using the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ laser
cooling transition. We generate high-flux, sub-$\mu$K samples of all three
bosonic strontium isotopes and demonstrate quasi-continuous outcoupling from
the MOT. These results highlight the system's suitability for compact, robust,
and field-deployable continuous cold atom devices.

TL;DR: The paper models the trapping of ultracold atoms using two-colour evanescent light in suspended optical rib waveguides, optimizing the trap's depth by adjusting frequencies and waveguide modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of trapping ultracold atoms, which is crucial for precision physics experiments.

Method: The study involves modeling two-colour evanescent light waveguide configurations, optimizing frequencies and modes for deeper traps.

Result: The optimal setup achieves trap depths exceeding 0.3 mK for rubidium atoms.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances atom trapping efficiency by strategically adjusting optical components.

Abstract: The trapping of ultracold atoms using two-colour evanescent light waves
formed by propagating modes of suspended optical rib waveguides is modelled in
different configurations. Reducing the anisotropy of the two-colour evanescent
optical dipole potential requires two laser light components with a large
frequency difference. The upper frequency is guided in the two lowest
transverse waveguide modes and the lower frequency propagates in a single-mode
regime. This increases the dipole potential depth in the lateral direction. An
additional increase in the optical dipole potential can be achieved by tuning
the frequencies of the two modes to two different atomic transitions. When
applied to rubidium, the total depth of the corresponding surface optical
dipole traps can reach 0.3 mK or above under reasonable conditions.

Abstract: Nonlinear parity-time (PT) symmetry in non-Hermitian wireless power transfer
(WPT) systems, while attracting significant attention from both physics and
engineering communities, have posed formidable theoretical and practical
challenges due to their complex dynamical mechanisms. Here, we revisit
multistability in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems and find that the PT-symmetry
state is not always stable even in PT-symmetry phase. We report a discovery on
a nonlinear clock-pulling mechanism, which can forcibly break the PT symmetry.
Proper implementation of this mechanism can switch the system stability,
particularly in stabilizing the conventional unstable state which has the
maximum transfer efficiency for WPT. Our work offers new tools for
non-Hermitian physics and is expected to drive technological progress.

Motivation: The paper addresses the application of Silicon carbide in both CMOS and quantum electronics, making it relevant for future technologies. It assesses the feasibility of using commercial power MOSFETs for cryogenic applications, which could be important for the development of quantum devices or cryogenic CMOS systems.

Method: The study involves a statistical analysis of threshold voltage and subthreshold swing measurements from 300K down to 650mK, focusing on reproducibility and variability across samples. They look for effects like gate hysteresis and changes in subthreshold swing.

Result: Key findings indicate large gate hysteresis and thresholds shifting upwards, along with deteriorated subthreshold swing. These findings suggest poor electrostatic control at low temperatures, likely due to carrier freeze-out and high trap density, which could hinder the reliable operation of these transistors in quantum device applications.

Conclusion: The results imply that current power MOSFETs may not be suitable for low-temperature cryogenic applications critical for quantum electronics, suggesting a need for further device optimization or alternative materials.

Abstract: Silicon carbide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with an emerging CMOS
technology platform and it is widely deployed in high power and harsh
environment electronics. This material is also attracting interest for quantum

commercial power MOSFETs to evaluate their suitability for CMOS-compatible
quantum electronics. We perform a statistical study of threshold voltage and
subthreshold swing from 300 K down to 650 mK, focusing on reproducibility and
variability. Our results show significant performance degradation at low
temperatures, including large gate hysteresis, threshold voltage shifts, and
subthreshold swing deterioration. These effects suggest instability in
electrostatic control, likely due to carrier freeze-out and high interface trap

Motivation: The study suggests a novel approach to enhancing wave control in metamaterials through the combination of nonreciprocal stiffness and damping, which could have implications for various engineering applications requiring precise wave manipulation.

Method: The paper employs a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to investigate the system's behavior under different damping conditions.

Result: The coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and damping results in decoupled control mechanisms, enabling enhanced amplification for slower waves and promoting boundary-induced wave mixing.

Conclusion: The findings provide a theoretical foundation for designing active metamaterials with scalable and versatile wave control capabilities, opening up potential applications in phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials.

Abstract: Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In
this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice
that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing
how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a
non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic
damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and
nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The
nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate,
while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity
and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the
enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves and
boundary-induced wave mixing. These findings provide a theoretical framework
for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave
propagation characteristics.

*Henry Davenport,Johannes Knolle,Frank Schindler*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper explores the concept of exciton Berry phases in semiconductors and introduces a projected position operator to define Berry connections. It connects these phases to the modern theory of polarization and provides a discrete Wilson loop method for calculation. The study also examines these phases under different crystal symmetries and applies the framework to construct gauge-invariant measures of excitonic polarization, building on shift excitons theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the geometric phases in many-body excitonic states is crucial for advancing the theory of polarons and topological materials. The Berry phase offers insights into the topological properties of materials, particularly under symmetry operations.

Method: The paper employs methods from theoretical condensed matter physics, including modern polar theory and symmetry analysis. It introduces mathematical frameworks like the projected position operator and Wilson loops to compute Berry phases and excitonic polarization.

Result: The authors establish a relationship between the Berry phases and the polarization of excitonic states, develop computational tools to determine these phases, and validate their theory across different symmetry operations.

Conclusion: This work enhances our understanding of the role of Berry phases in exciton-rich materials and provides tools for characterizing complex polaronic states, particularly useful for topological and correlated electronic systems.

Abstract: In translationally invariant semiconductors that host exciton bound states,
one can define an infinite number of possible exciton Berry connections. These
correspond to the different ways in which a many-body exciton state, at fixed
total momentum, can be decomposed into free electron and hole Bloch states that
are entangled by an exciton envelope wave function. Inspired by the modern
theory of polarization, we define an exciton projected position operator whose
eigenvalues single out two unique choices of exciton Berry phase and associated
Berry connection - one for electrons, and one for holes. We clarify the
physical meaning of these exciton Berry phases and provide a discrete Wilson
loop formulation that allows for their numerical calculation without a smooth
gauge. As a corollary, we obtain a gauge-invariant expression for the exciton
polarisation at a given total momentum, i.e. the mean separation of the
electron and hole within the exciton wave function. In the presence of
crystalline inversion symmetry, the electron and hole exciton Berry phases are
quantized to the same value and we derive how this value can be expressed in
terms of inversion eigenvalues of the many-body exciton state. We then consider
crystalline $C_2 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry, for which no symmetry eigenvalues are
available as it is anti-unitary, and confirm that the exciton Berry phase
remains quantized and still diagnoses topologically distinct exciton bands. Our
theory thereby generalizes the notion of shift excitons, whose exciton Wannier
states are displaced from those of the non-interacting bands by a quantized
amount, beyond symmetry indicators.

Abstract: We theoretically explore higher-order topological magnons in collinear
altermagnets, encompassing a dimensional hierarchy ranging from localized
corner modes to propagating hinge excitations. By employing antiferromagnetic
interlayer coupling in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian, our work
reveals anisotropic surface states and spatially distributed hinge modes within
AA-type stacking configurations. We track the adiabatic evolution of Wannier

band structure beyond conventional topology. Harnessing the stability and
propagative properties of hinge modes, our study offers a potential platform
for magnonic quantum information processing in altermagnetic systems that
performs energy-efficient logic operation.

Abstract: Antimony (Sb), an element with strong spin-orbit coupling, is predicted to
undergo a topological phase transition from a topological semimetal to a
topological insulator as its dimensionality approaches the two-dimensional
limit, driven by the quantum confinement effect. In this study, we investigate
this transition in Sb thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, employing
electrical transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). Electrical transport measurements revealed signatures of a modified
electronic band structure, including a Hall response with multiple carrier
types, a decreasing carrier concentration, and a transition in the curvature of
the longitudinal resistance from quadratic to linear with decreasing film
thickness. Temperature-dependent magnetoresistance further showed weak
antilocalization below 16 K, indicating strong spin-orbit coupling and
suggesting the presence of non-trivial topological states. Analysis of the WAL
characteristics revealed a single coherent conducting channel and a
thickness-dependent change in the phase decoherence mechanism. Complementary
ARPES measurements confirmed that reducing the film thickness lifts the
conduction band at the M-point, consistent with the emergence of a band gap.
These findings support theoretical predictions of a thickness-dependent band
structure evolution driven by the quantum confinement effect, providing a
foundation for further exploration of topological phase transitions in Sb as
well as Bi1-xSbx. The realization of an elemental topological material with
simplified stoichiometry and semiconductor compatibility presents a promising
avenue for next-generation hybrid systems and applications in spintronics and
quantum technologies.

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor and quantum Fisher information have recently
been shown to provide a unified geometric description of the linear response of
many-body systems. However, a similar geometric description of higher-order
perturbative phenomena including nonlinear response in generic quantum systems
is lacking. In this work, we develop a general framework for the time-dependent
quantum geometry of many-body systems by treating external perturbing fields as
coordinates on the space of density matrices. We use the Bures distance between
the initial and time-evolved density matrix to define geometric quantities
through a perturbative expansion. To lowest order, we derive a time-dependent
generalization of the Bures metric related to the spectral density of linear
response functions, unifying previous results for the quantum metric in various
limits and providing a geometric interpretation of Fermi's golden rule. At next
order in the expansion, we define a time-dependent Bures-Levi-Civita connection
for general many-body systems. We show that the connection is the sum of one
contribution that is related to a second-order nonlinear response function, and
a second contribution that captures the higher geometric structure of
first-order perturbation theory. We show that in the quasistatic,
zero-temperature limit for noninteracting fermions, this Bures connection
reduces to the known expression for band-theoretic Christoffel symbols. Our
work provides a systematic framework to explore many-body quantum geometry
beyond the quantum metric and highlights how higher-order correlation functions
can probe this geometry.

Abstract: We present models of topological insulating Hamiltonians exhibiting intrinsic
altermagnetic features, protected by combined three-fold or four-fold
rotational symmetries with time-reversal. We demonstrate that the spin Chern
number serves as a robust topological invariant in two-dimensional systems,
while for three-dimensional structures, the topological nature is characterized
by the spin Chern numbers computed on the $k_z$=$0$ and $k_z$=$\pi$ planes. The
resulting phases support symmetry-protected boundary modes, including corner,
hinges and surface states, whose structure is determined by the magnetic
symmetry and the local magnetic moments. Our findings bridge the fields of
altermagnetism and topological quantum matter, and establish a theoretical
framework for engineering spintronic topological systems without net

TL;DR: This paper investigates the spin states of titanium atoms adsorbed on MgO/Ag(100) surfaces. Two distinct spin states, S=1/2 and S=1, are observed based on the local site and MgO film thickness. DFT calculations suggest a Ti⁺ configuration with electron distribution between polarizing and depolarizing orbitals, which supports scalable atom-by-atom control for quantum platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the potential of using surface-supported single atoms as spin qubits for quantum architectures, emphasizing the importance of understanding spin states and their controllability for quantum computing applications.

Method: The study combines scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques to measure the spin states of titanium atoms on MgO/Ag substrates. They use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to analyze the electron configuration and orbital contributions to the spin states.

Result: The research reveals that the spin state of titanium atoms depends on their adsorption site and the MgO film thickness, with electrons populating valence shells in a way that affects the spin. Local factors such as surface polarization influence the charge distribution, leading to either S=1/2 or S=1 spin states.

Conclusion: This work highlights the tunability of spin states in surface-supported single atoms, suggesting a promising route for scalable atomically controlled quantum systems on solid surfaces. The ability to manipulate spin and charge states atomically offers significant potential for advancing quantum computing through atomically identical but addressable quantum bits.

Abstract: Single atomic adsorbates on ultrathin insulating films provide a promising
route toward bottom-up quantum architectures based on atomically identical yet
individually addressable spin qubits on solid surfaces. A key challenge in
engineering quantum-coherent spin nanostructures lies in understanding and
controlling the spin state of individual adsorbates. In this work, we
investigate single titanium (Ti) atoms adsorbed on MgO/Ag(100) surfaces using a
combined scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. Our
measurements reveal two distinct spin states, $S = 1/2$ and $S = 1$, depending
on the local adsorption site and the thickness of the MgO film. Density
functional theory calculations suggest a Ti$^+$ configuration for the Ti
adsorbates with approximately 3 electrons in the 4$s$ and 3$d$ valence shells.
Using a multi-orbital atomic multiplet calculations the site dependence of the
spin can be rationalized as a charge redistribution between spin-polarizing and
depolarizing orbitals. These findings underscore the potential of
surface-supported single atoms as spin qubits with tunable spin and charge
states, enabling atom-by-atom control in the realization of a versatile quantum
platform on surfaces.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the spin configurations in few-layer CrSBr and their photoluminescence (PL) properties, highlighting the Xh peak and its dependence on magnetic order, making it a good platform for studying exciton-magnetism interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spin configurations in layered materials is crucial for spintronic applications, which aims to use electron spins for electronic devices. The paper focuses on few-layer CrSBr, a material that exhibits layered structure, making it suitable for studying two-dimensional electronic systems. The challenge here is to detect and manipulate these spin properties, which is important for future spintronic technologies.

Method: The researchers used photoluminescence spectroscopy to study the PL from few-layer CrSBr samples. They encapsulated the samples with hBN to possibly enhance certain properties. They also performed first-principles calculations to theoretically support their observations. The method involved a combination of experimental and computational approaches to analyze the material's properties.

Result: The paper reports the emission of excitons at specific energy levels, Xl and Xh, which split into multiple peaks with varying interlayer magnetic order. First-principles calculations link the Xh peak to a specific electronic transition, and the intensity and position of this peak change with the magnetic order, providing a tool to probe spin states. Additionally, they observe intermediate magnetic states when a magnetic field is applied at the easy axis direction, suggesting complex magnetic ordering in multilayer systems.

Conclusion: This study provides a systematic understanding of how the spin configurations in few-layer CrSBr affect their photoluminescence, offering a new approach to study the interaction between light-emitting excitons and magnetic ordering. The findings underscore the potential of few-layer CrSBr as an ideal platform for exploring the interplay between material structure, magnetism, and optoelectronic properties, paving the way for future spintronic applications.

Abstract: The detection and manipulation of the spin configurations in layered magnetic
semiconductors hold significant interest for developing spintronic devices in
two-dimensional limit. In this letter, we report a systematical study on the
photoluminescence (PL) from the high energy excitons in few-layer CrSBr and its
application on detecting the spin configurations. Besides the broad excitonic
emission peak (Xl) at around 1.34 eV, we also observed another strong excitonic
emission peak (Xh) at around 1.37 eV in hBN encapsulated 2L sample, which
splits into two peaks in 3L and 4L samples. With help of the first principles
calculations, we conclude that the Xh peak is associated with the transition
between the top valence band and the second lowest conduction band, which is
forbidden by the inversion symmetry in 1L CrSBr. Furthermore, the position and
intensity of the Xh peak are strongly dependent on the interlayer magnetic
order of the CrSBr samples, which provides an efficient way to probe their spin
configurations. In addition, when the magnetic field is applied at the easy
axis direction, we resolve an intermediate magnetic state besides the
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states in 3L and 4L samples. Our results
reveal few-layer CrSBr as an ideal platform to study the interaction between
the excitons and magnetism.

Abstract: We investigate from first principles a variety of low-dimensional open
quantum spin systems based on magnetic nanographene structures that contain
spin-1/2 and spin-1 triangulenes and/or olympicenes. These graphene
nanostructures behave as localized spins and can be effectively described by a
quantum bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we will compute
the energy spectrum and the quantum numbers associated with the low-energy
eigenstates. We propose the experimental realization of antiferromagnetic
alternating spin chains using these graphene nanostructures, which result in
ferrimagnetic systems whose ground state spin and degeneracy depend on the
length of the chain. We also identify a double degeneracy in the total spin
quantum number $S$ in the first excited state for three-leg spin graphs
(3-LSGs). This degeneracy depends on both the number of sites and the spin
species that compose the 3-LSG. We identify the double degeneracy of the first
excited state as a consequence of swapping transformation symmetry of the
Hamiltonian.

Abstract: We report the development of a cryogenic powder filter that simultaneously
offers high attenuation of radio-frequency (RF) signals in the gigahertz (GHz)
range and minimized parasitic capacitance to ground. Conventional powder
filters, which consist of a signal line passing through a metal powder-filled
housing, attenuate high-frequency signals via the skin effect. However, these
designs often suffer from significant parasitic capacitance between the signal
line and the grounded chassis, which can compromise the performance of
sensitive measurement setups by limiting their frequency bandwidth. In this
work, we demonstrate that a multilayer powder filter design effectively
achieves both high RF attenuation and reduced parasitic capacitance. This
solution suppresses sample heating due to the unintentional intrusion of RF
signals through the wiring, without degrading the performance of the
measurement setup.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of high-performance magnetic nanocomposites with superparamagnetic nanoparticles embedded in an insulating polymer matrix. The materials exhibit excellent magnetic properties, showing low hysteresis and high susceptibility, suitable for applications in inductors and micro fabrications. However, the high-frequency performance may require further optimization through narrower particle size distributions to reduce losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely driven by the demand for advanced magnetic materials suitable for high-frequency applications in electronics, such as inductors, transformers, and sensors. The development of such materials could address the growing need for smaller, cheaper, and more efficient devices in the semiconductor industry and IoT devices.

Method: The methodology involves synthesizing γ-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles with a specific size range (11±3 nm) and incorporating them into a poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix through casting or printing methods. The properties of the nanocomposites are evaluated using techniques such as neutron scattering, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and AC response analysis. Additionally, the application of these materials in micro fabricated inductors is demonstrated through experimental measurements.

Result: The nanocomposite materials demonstrate high magnetic performance, including superparamagnetic behavior with negligible hysteresis at low frequencies and high AC response. The materials are suitable for inductor applications, with induction measured up to 100 MHz. However, the power losses are significant and scale with B-field and frequency, suggesting the need for further optimization in the particle size distribution to enhance efficiency at higher frequencies.

Conclusion: The presented magnetic nanocomposite materials based on γ-Fe₂O₃ show promising potential for use in high-frequency electromagnetic applications. While the current performance is suitable for inductor applications, further research into optimizing the particle size distribution is recommended to address the observed power losses and improve efficiency.

Abstract: We here present printable and castable magnetic nanocomposites containing
superparamagnetic 11$\pm$3 nm $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ particles in an insulating
poly-vinyl alcohol polymer matrix. The nanocomposites feature well-dispersed
particles with volume fractions between 10 and 45 \%, as confirmed by
small-angle neutron scattering. The magnetic volume susceptibility is as high
as 17, together with negligible hysteresis at low frequency, and constant
AC-response up to the high-kHz range. Measured hysteresis curves at 100-900 kHz
with up to 110 mT induced $B$-fields in the nanocomposite show that power
losses depend on $B$-field squared, and frequency to the power of 1-1.3. The
only loss mechanism in the nanocomposite is hysteresis losses at $>$100 kHz
frequencies, where the largest particles in the 11$\pm$3 nm distribution
transition from the superparamagnetic to blocked regime. To mitigate the
resulting hysteresis losses (up 10$^2$-10$^5$ kW/m$^3$) a more narrow particle
size distribution could be used for future materials. The presented material is
eddy current-free and easily integrated into micro-fabrication protocols, as we
demonstrate by fabrication of 3-turn print circuit board based inductors with
cast/manual printed nanocomposite inductor cores, on which induction has been
measured up to 100 MHz.

Abstract: The linear Edelstein effect is a cornerstone phenomenon in spintronics that
describes the generation of spin magnetization in response to an applied
electric field. Recent theoretical advances have reignited interest in its
nonlinear counterpart, the nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which spin
magnetization is induced by a second-order electric field. However, the
intrinsic contribution to both effects is generally forbidden in systems
preserving time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) or composite symmetries such
as $\mathcal{T}\tau_{1/2}$, where $\tau_{1/2}$ denotes a half-lattice
translation. In such systems, spin magnetization typically emerges either from
extrinsic mechanisms but limited to metals due to their Fermi-surface property,
or from dynamical electric fields with a terahertz driving frequency. Here, we
propose a new mechanism for spin magnetization, arising from the interplay of
magnetic and electric fields, termed the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein
effect. Remarkably, its intrinsic component, determined purely by the
material's band structure, can appear even in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant
materials, but lacking inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{P}$), including
insulators. On the other hand, we illustrate that its extrinsic component can
serve as a sensitive indicator of the N\'eel vector reversal in
$\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials, offering a
novel route for antiferromagnetic order detection. To validate our theory, we
perform explicit calculations using a two-band Dirac model and a tight-binding
model on a honeycomb lattice, finding that both effects yield sizable spin
magnetization. Our findings establish the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein
effect as a versatile platform for both exploring nonlinear spin physics and
enabling symmetry-based detection of antiferromagnetic order.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using pseudofractal analysis, specifically star-mesh transformations, to design optimized high-resistance QHARS. The approach evaluates different recursion cases, using Minkowski-Bouligand metrics for fractal dimensions to enhance flexibility while increasing element count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems interested in optimizing QHARS device designs to achieve specific resistances more efficiently through fractal structures.

Method: The method involves developing resistor network designs through star-mesh transformations, analyzing device topologies with Minkowski-Bouligand algorithms, and evaluating partial recursion cases via fractal dimensions to optimize resistance values while considering element count.

Result: The result suggests that by introducing partial recursions based on pseudofractals, it's possible to achieve targeted resistances with increased design flexibility compared to full recursion, though with a trade-off in element numbers.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a generalized framework for materials-independent QHARS optimization, enhancing both resistance specificity and flexibility in device designs through the use of pseudofractals and star-mesh transformations.

Abstract: This work introduces a pseudofractal analysis for optimizing high-resistance
graphene-based quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS). The
development of resistance standard device designs through star-mesh
transformations is detailed, aimed at minimizing element count. Building on a
recent mathematical framework, the approach presented herein refines QHARS
device concepts by considering designs incorporating pseudofractals (which may
be expressed as star-mesh transformations). To understand how future QHARS
pseudofractal designs enable varying sizes of neighborhoods of available
quantized resistance, Minkowski-Bouligand algorithms are used to analyze
fractal dimensions of the device design topologies. Three distinct partial
recursion cases are explored in addition to the original full recursion design,
and expressions for their total element counts are derived. These partial
recursions, assessed through their fractal dimensions, offer enhanced
flexibility in achieving specific resistance values within a desired
neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, albeit with an increased
number of required elements. The formalisms presented are material-independent,
making them broadly applicable to other quantum Hall systems and artifact
standards.

Abstract: The increasing need for efficient thermal management in nanoelectronics
requires innovative thermal sensing solutions, as conventional sensors often

devices leverage magnetic skyrmions topologically protected spin textures known
for their robustness, nanoscale dimensions, and low power dynamics. We
demonstrate high thermal sensitivity with a linear temperature response over a

temperature measurement. In addition, the use of multilayer systems enhances
the sensitivity and robustness of the device. These results provide a

Result: The results show that partial recursions offer higher flexibility within a resistance range but necessitate more devices than full recursions. This trade-off is crucial for applications requiring precise resistance values but limited device availability.

Conclusion: The research concludes that fractal-based QHARS designs balance resistance accuracy with device count, providing a scalable approach for high-precision metrology and quantum applications.

Abstract: This work elaborates on how one may develop high-resistance quantized Hall
array resistance standards (QHARS) by using star-mesh transformations for
element count minimization. Refinements are made on a recently developed
mathematical framework optimizing QHARS device designs based on full, symmetric
recursion by reconciling approximate device values with exact effective
quantized resistances found by simulation and measurement. Furthermore, this
work explores the concept of fractal dimension, clarifying the benefits of both
full and partial recursions in QHARS devices. Three distinct partial recursion
cases are visited for a near-1 Gigaohm QHARS device. These partial recursions,
analyzed in the context of their fractal dimensions, offer increased
flexibility in accessing desired resistance values within a specific
neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, though at the cost of the
number of required devices.

Abstract: Filtering surface acoustic wave (SAW) signals of specified frequencies
depending on the strength of an external magnetic field in a magnetostrictive
material has garnered significant interest due to its potential scientific and
industrial applications. Here, we propose a device that achieves selective SAW
attenuation by instead programming its internal magnetic state. To this end, we
perform micromagnetic simulations for the magnetoelastic interaction of the
Rayleigh SAW mode with spin waves (SWs) in exchange-decoupled Co/Ni islets on a
piezoelectric LiTaO$_3$ substrate. Due to the islets exhibiting perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy, the stray-field interaction between them leads to a shift
in the SW dispersion depending on the magnetic alignment of neighboring islets.
This significantly changes the efficiency of the magnetoelastic interaction at
specified frequencies. We predict changes in SAW transmission of 28.9 dB/mm at
3.8 GHz depending on the state of the device. For the efficient simulation of
the device, we extend a prior energy conservation argument based on analytical
solutions of the SW to finite-difference numerical calculations, enabling the
modeling of arbitrary magnetization patterns like the proposed islet-based
design.

Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich
arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The
physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological
invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored
for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven
scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet
non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological
properties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus
expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and
formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven
quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered
complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust
(despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving
parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to
emergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame
approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when
appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To
substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit
(TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the
skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of
distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance
profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework
for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible
TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.

*Michael L. Li,Dingyu Shen,Jesus A. del Alamo,Martin Z. Bazant*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Three-terminal electrochemical ionic synapses (EIoS) have shown linear and symmetric conductance modulation using tungsten oxide (WO3) channels, allowing nanosecond timescale modulation, which surpasses bulk ion diffusion timescales. Theoretical analysis explains this through phase separation and controlled electric field effects in high-concentration regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the modulation capabilities of EIoS devices is crucial for emerging in-memory computing applications. The ability to perform nanosecond timescale conductance modulation could significantly enhance computational efficiency and speed. This paper addresses the underlying mechanisms that enable such modulation, providing insights into device design and optimization.

Method: The method involves theoretical modeling and simulations to analyze the WO3 channel's behavior under different conditions, including WO3 crystallinity, phase separation, and electric field effects at the gate electrode.

Result: The study demonstrates linear and symmetric conductance modulation in EIoS using WO3 by leveraging phase separation and controlling the reaction environment. This allows for much faster conductance modulation compared to previous studies.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that phase-separating systems can overcome diffusion limitations in EIoS devices, highlighting the potential for faster and more efficient in-memory computing applications. Further research is needed to optimize crystal quality and electrode control for scalability and reliability.

Abstract: Three-terminal electrochemical ionic synapses (EIoS) have recently attracted
interest for in-memory computing applications. These devices utilize
electrochemical ion intercalation to modulate the ion concentration in the
channel material. The electrical conductance, which is concentration dependent,
can be read separately and mapped to a non-volatile memory state. To compete
with other random access memory technologies, linear and symmetric conductance
modulation is often sought after, properties typically thought to be limited by
the slow ion diffusion timescale. A recent study by Onen et al.[1] examining
protonic EIoS with a tungsten oxide (WO3) channel revealed that this limiting
timescale seemed irrelevant, and linear conductance modulation was achieved
over nanosecond timescales, much faster than the bulk ion diffusion. This
contrasts with previous studies that have shown similar conductance modulation
with pulse timescales of milliseconds to seconds. Understanding the phenomena
behind these conductance modulation properties in EIoS systems remains a
crucial question gating technological improvements to these devices. Here, we
provide a theoretical explanation that demonstrates how linearity and symmetry
arise from consistent control over the electrolyte-WO3 interface. Comparing
these past works, changes in the WO3 channel crystallinity were identified,
affecting material thermodynamics and revealing that the device achieving
nanosecond pulse timescales underwent phase separation. Coupling of electric
field polarizatino and increased electron conductivity in high-concentration
filaments, the reaction environment at the gate electrode can be controlled,
resulting in ideal conductance modulation within the diffusion-limited regime.
This work highlights the potential for phase-separating systems to overcome the
traditional diffusion barriers that limit EIoS performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphene's electronic quality improvements and overcoming spatial charge fluctuations are the main motivations for this study.

Method: Encapsulation of graphene with multiple layers of graphene at a large twist angle (~10-30°) to decouple electronic interaction between layers.

Result: The approach achieves Coulomb screening, reduces inhomogeneity, enhances Landau quantization at low magnetic fields, and opens avenues for exploring other 2D systems.

Conclusion: This method provides a significant advancement in creating highly performant graphene-based devices by mitigating spatial charge fluctuations through layer encapsulation and tuning interactions with twist angles.

Abstract: The electronic quality of graphene has improved significantly over the past
two decades, revealing novel phenomena. However, even state-of-the-art devices
exhibit substantial spatial charge fluctuations originating from charged
defects inside the encapsulating crystals, limiting their performance. Here, we
overcome this issue by assembling devices in which graphene is encapsulated by
other graphene layers while remaining electronically decoupled from them via a
large twist angle (~10-30{\deg}). Doping of the encapsulating graphene layer
introduces strong Coulomb screening, maximized by the sub-nanometer distance
between the layers, and reduces the inhomogeneity in the adjacent layer to just
a few carriers per square micrometre. The enhanced quality manifests in Landau
quantization emerging at magnetic fields as low as ~5 milli-Tesla and enables
resolution of a small energy gap at the Dirac point. Our encapsulation approach
can be extended to other two-dimensional systems, enabling further exploration
of the electronic properties of ultrapure devices.

Result: 发现了不同波段间的迁移导致两种不同的磁阻效应，其中CrI₃层产生的增强效应显著，MoSe₂/Sp/graphene复合层中的抑制效应增强至三个数量级，CrI₃层和WSe₂/Sp/graphene系统都表现出强烈的n-和p-掺杂不均匀性，通过改变转角和外加指数电场实现了对自旋轨道矩的控制。

Conclusion: Our findings highlight the potential of using two-dimensional materials such as WSe₂, MoSe₂, and CrI₃ in spin-orbit torque applications, particularly by tuning the bilayer geometry and external electric field to manipulate the self-spinning effects.

Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in employing two key classes of two-dimensional
materials-topological insulators and transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs)-as spin sources for generating spin-orbit torque (SOT), we investigate
current-induced spin polarization and the resulting SOT in bilayers composed of
a TMDC (WSe$_2$ or MoSe$_2$) and ferromagnetic chromium iodide (CrI$_3$),
beyond the linear response regime. Using the steady-state Boltzmann equation,
we find that intra-band transitions yield a strong field-like torque on the
CrI$_3$ layer, while inter-band transitions give rise to a comparatively weaker
damping-like torque in the WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ system. Remarkably, the damping-like
component is enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude in n-doped MoSe$_2$,
reaching a strength comparable to the field-like torque, which itself is an
order of magnitude larger than that in the WSe$_2$-based bilayer. Both torque
components exhibit strong asymmetry between n-type and p-type doping in WSe$_2$
and MoSe$_2$ systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the twist angle plays a
crucial role: depending on the TMDC and chemical potential, twisting can
reverse the sign of the SOT and significantly modulate its magnitude. Finally,
we show that a transverse gate electric field enables substantial tunability of
the SOT, by nearly one order of magnitude, and induces a sign reversal at a
twist angle of $10.16^{\circ}$.

Abstract: We derive the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle confined to the surface
of a normal and a binormal helical nanoribbon, obtain the quantum potentials
induced by their respective curved surface geometries, and study the localized
states of the particle for each ribbon. When the particle momentum satisfies a
certain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a
normal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result
suggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely
along the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted
as a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse
deflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke
Ehrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized
angular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle
is an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like
voltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall
effect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved
surface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a
binormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron
transport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC
voltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices.
Quantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends
and twists of its surface, suggesting diverse applications in biopolymers and
nanotechnology.

Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a
higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an
irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is
constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice
that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when
such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an
aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension.
In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological
crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$)
symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological
branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust
endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap
modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being
devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that
such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and
weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states
residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects,
besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we
showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order
topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in
its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline
branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes
only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal.
Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally
harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.

Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by
singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced
dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence
quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on
inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between
inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the
entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical
model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet
pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by
TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a
few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the
zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and
information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton
hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order
of 150 ps in rubrene.

TL;DR: This paper investigates absolute length metrology using DFMI, detailing the statistical and systematic limitations, reading algorithms, and providing insights into bias suppression for high-precision measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent challenges in interferometric measurements, particularly the ambiguity issue, make this paper valuable for understanding ways to improve accuracy in Length metrology.

Method: The paper employs statistical analysis, including Cramér-Rao Lower Bound, Non-Linear Least Squares, and Extended Kalman Filter, to explore the limitations and biases in DFMI measurements.

Result: The study identifies dead zones of precision, signal integration time effects, and specific operation points for reduced errors, suggesting advanced compensation techniques are necessary.

Conclusion: The research provides crucial insights for improving system designs and achieving high-precision absolute measurements using DFMI.

Abstract: High-precision absolute length metrology using laser interferometry faces
inherent challenges from interferometric ambiguity. Deep Frequency Modulation
Interferometry (DFMI) addresses this by simultaneously extracting two distinct
length-encoding parameters: the precise, ambiguous interferometric phase
($\Phi$) and the coarser, unambiguous effective modulation depth ($m$). This
paper establishes the fundamental statistical and systematic limitations
governing the absolute accuracy of DFMI. We detail two primary readout
algorithms: a frequency-domain Non-Linear Least Squares (NLS) fit and a
time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bound (CRLB) for the estimation of $m$ and $\Phi$, identifying intrinsic ``dead
zones'' where precision degrades, and asymptotic limits as a function of signal
quality and integration time, achievable by both NLS and EKF. Critically, we
develop analytical models for dominant systematic biases, revealing previously
uncharted ``valleys of robustness'' -- specific operating points where errors
from modulation non-linearity and residual amplitude modulation are strongly
suppressed. This analysis clarifies critical trade-offs between different
design parameters, integration time, and total error, informing instrument
design and underscoring the necessity of advanced compensation techniques for
high-accuracy applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors critique existing interferometer designs, pointing out their inefficiencies in programming and output energy.

Method: The analysis involves examining known architectures like MZI and beamsplitter meshes to evaluate their complexity and efficiency.

Result: The study reveals that current designs have significant programming challenges and low output energy, limiting their practicality.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a need for more efficient programming algorithms and designs to overcome these limitations in photonics.

Abstract: Coherent multiport interferometers are a promising approach to realize matrix
multiplication in integrated photonics. However, most known architectures -
such as MZI and beamsplitter meshes, as well as more general interferometers -
suffer from complicated procedures for mapping the matrix elements of the
desired transformation to specific phaseshifts in the device. We point out that
the high programming complexity is intrinsic, rather than accidental. At the
same time, we argue that interferometers admitting efficient programming
algorithms in general yield a much lower useful output energy, which ultimately
limits their accuracy and energy efficiency.

Abstract: A Si slab waveguide resonator design with a circulating Gaussian-like cavity
mode is described and characterized, for both all-pass and add-drop
configurations and several different input/output coupling strengths. The
circulating beam propagates in a slab waveguide with no lateral confinement.
Three straight mirrors and one curved mirror define a folded two-dimensional
Gaussian cavity. Light is coupled to and from the resonator by beam splitters
formed by a narrow gap between a cavity mirror and the input slab waveguides.
The coupling is determined by the gap width and is wavelength independent and
lossless. For a L=100 um path length cavity, resonance line widths of 5 pm with
Q-values of Q = 310000 were measured. The resonator drop spectrum exhibited a
comb of almost identical resonance lines across a 100 nm tuning range. This
resonator design is capable of broadband operation and is less susceptible to
sidewall roughness and defect scattering induced loss and mode splitting, when
compared with Si rings formed from narrow single mode waveguides.

Result: The study shows nearly flat plasmonic bands, hyperbolic plasmons, and high optical anisotropy in HG, indicating potential for applications in nanophotonics.

Conclusion: Holey graphene has potential as a material for nanophotonic applications due to its tunable electronic and optical properties under different structural configurations.

Abstract: Holey graphene (HG) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) material that has
attracted considerable attention due to its remarkable electrical, thermal, and
mechanical properties. The recent discovery of flat bands in HG has garnered
significant interest. In this work, we systematically investigate the tunable
plasmonic modes and optical conductivity of HG at or near the flat band
condition by changing the holes radii and periodic configuration. It is found
that HG presents nearly flat plasmonic bands in configurations with larger hole
radii. Hyperbolic plasmons are found due to the breaking of the graphene's
bipartite sublattice symmetry induced by the holes. Such an effect is also
confirmed by looking at the optical conductivity, that also presents a marked
anisotropy. The material's marked optical anisotropy leads to hyperbolic

Abstract: Metasurfaces are innovative planar optical structures capable of manipulating
incident light properties. Accurate and computationally efficient modeling of
such metasurfaces, particularly those with irregular geometries, remains a
challenge for conventional solvers. In this work, we present a mesh-free
Physics-Informed PointNet (PIPN) to model electromagnetic scattering from
all-dielectric metasurfaces that feature spatially varying nanopillars. Our
approach uses the PointNet architecture to directly encode spatially varying
material properties into the Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)
framework. We demonstrate the generalization capability of our PIPN through
evaluations on datasets; these datasets are generated with varying refractive
indices representing common dielectric materials. Furthermore, the inclination
angles are varied within each dataset, which represent expected manufacturing
defects. Overall, our method provides a promising, mesh-free framework for
accurate and efficient modeling of complex optical structures represented by
irregular geometries.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach using air-suspended nanomembranes to enable atomic-scale control of light-matter interactions, which is crucial for advancing quantum photonics, 2D optoelectronics, and semiconductor technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of integrating atomic layer materials into photonic systems, which are essential for next-gen quantum and semiconductor technologies, but their small optical interaction volume presents a challenge. The proposed solution, air-suspended nanomembranes, offers a way to overcome this limitation through their extreme thinness and low radiative loss.

Method: The authors developed a photonic nanomembrance with a thickness as thin as 29 nm, comparable to atomic layer materials. They demonstrate the capability to achieve angstrom-level thickness modulation by integrating atomic layer materials, resulting in significant shifts in high-Q resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping confirms uniform and deterministic tuning of resonance across the surface.

Result: The key results include the development of an ultrathin nanomembrane enabling atomic-scale light control, achieving precise thickness modulation leading to resonance shifts, and validating uniformity through high-resolution spatial mapping. These results support the scalable integration of atomic layer materials into photonic systems.

Conclusion: This study opens new possibilities for advancing quantum photonics, 2D optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductors by providing a scalable solution for achieving atomic-scale control of light interactions through air-suspended nanomembranes.

Abstract: Atomic layer materials have emerged as essential building blocks for next
generation quantum and semiconductor technologies, where atomic scale control
over light matter interactions is critical. However, their inherently small
optical interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient
integration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation
requires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance
atomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, air suspended nanomembranes with
extreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for
integrating atomic layer materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate
an ultrathin freestanding photonic nanomembrane with a thickness down to 29 nm
comparable to that of atomic layer materials enabling atomic scale control of
light coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the
surface and significantly enhances light matter interaction. Through the
integration of atomic layer material, we achieve angstrom level thickness
modulation, where a single atomic-layer-deposition cycle corresponding to a
thickness increment of 0.65 angstrom results in a 0.09 nm shift in the high Q
resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and
deterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface. This approach
provides a scalable and versatile route for atomic-scale light coupling,
effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional photonics and enabling
progress in quantum photonics, 2D optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor
technologies.

TL;DR: The paper explains how ray tracing simulations can reproduce optical images of complex 3D objects, especially in fluid dynamics, by accurately modeling illumination and optical effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from discrepancies between simulated and experimental optical images, leading to the requirement for high-fidelity simulations better aligned with real-world optical phenomena.

Method: Ray tracing simulations are used to model the spatial and angular distribution of illumination, ensuring accurate replication of optical effects in both experiments and simulations.

Result: The simulations successfully replicate brightfield microscopy images of complex shapes and phenomena like pressure and shock waves.

Conclusion: Ray tracing offers a method to improve the accuracy of optical imaging and analysis for complex 3D objects in fields like fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Optical images of transparent three-dimensional objects can be different from
a replica of the object's cross section in the image plane, due to refraction
at the surface or in the body of the object. Simulations of the object's image
are thus needed for the visualization and validation of physical models, but
previous image simulations for fluid dynamics showed significant differences
from experiments. We report ray tracing image simulations that replicate with
high fidelity brightfield microscopy images of drops with complex shapes, and
images of pressure and shock waves traveling inside them. For high fidelity,
the simulations must replicate the spatial and angular distribution of
illumination rays, and both the experiment and the simulation must be designed
for accurate optical modeling. These techniques are directly applicable to
optical microscopy and expand the type and the accuracy of three-dimensional
information that can be extracted from optical images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the issue of photon scattering interference in turbid media across various fields, proposing a more accurate model to overcome the limitations of current approaches.

Method: The model utilizes GPU acceleration, Mie scattering theory, and CUDA for efficient phase function sampling and scattering processes through optimized precomputed distributions.

Result: The model shows better accuracy in simulating light intensity distributions, validated through experiments with polystyrene microspheres.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers high precision for optical applications in complex scattering environments, extending the capabilities of traditional models.

Abstract: Addressing the problem of photon multiple scattering interference caused by
turbid media in optical measurements, biomedical imaging, environmental
monitoring and other fields, existing Monte Carlo light scattering simulations
widely adopt the Henyey-Greenstein (H-G) phase function approximation model.
However, traditional computational resource limitations and high numerical
complexity have constrained the application of precise scattering models.
Moreover, the single-parameter anisotropy factor assumption neglects
higher-order scattering effects and backscattering intensity, failing to
accurately characterize the multi-order scattering properties of complex media.
To address these issues, we propose a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo-Rigorous Mie
scattering transport model for complex scattering environments. The model
employs rigorous Mie scattering theory to replace the H-G approximation,
achieving efficient parallel processing of phase function sampling and complex
scattering processes through pre-computed cumulative distribution function
optimization and deep integration with CUDA parallel architecture. To validate
the model accuracy, a standard scattering experimental platform based on
5{\mu}m polystyrene microspheres was established, with multiple optical depth
experimental conditions designed, and spatial registration techniques employed
to achieve precise alignment between simulation and experimental images. The
research results quantitatively demonstrate the systematic accuracy advantages
of rigorous Mie scattering phase functions over H-G approximation in simulating
lateral scattering light intensity distributions, providing reliable
theoretical foundations and technical support for high-precision optical
applications in complex scattering environments.

Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in the ability of synchrotron measurements to provide detailed insights into complex optical structures like blazed gratings, which are crucial for applications in optical devices and nanotechnology. By leveraging both diffraction and diffuse scattering, the research seeks to enhance the understanding of these structures at a nanoscale level.

Method: The methodology involves numerical simulations using multiple Helmholtz equation solvers and perturbation theory. Data is collected from synchrotron sources along with atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to analyze the structure and scattering of blazed gratings.

Result: Through numerical simulations and data analysis from synchrotron sources, the study reveals that diffraction patterns are most sensitive to the average groove profile of blazed gratings, while diffuse scattering patterns are influenced by the surface roughness. This dual sensitivity allows for comprehensive structural analysis using synchrotron measurements.

Conclusion: This study underscores the value of synchrotron measurements as a key tool in nanometrology for assessing and optimizing the performance of blazed gratings, complementing traditional microscopy techniques to advance optical element development and applications.

Abstract: This study explores the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology
tool for blazed gratings. In grazing incidence geometry, one can measure both
the conical diffraction and the diffuse scattering on the grating
simultaneously in a single scattering pattern. The sensitivity of scattering
patterns to the structure of the blazed gratings is evaluated. The diffraction
component of the pattern is shown to be sensitive to the average groove profile
of the gratings. Meanwhile, the diffuse scattering depends on the roughness
morphology of the reflective surface of blazed gratings. These findings are
supported by numerical simulations. The simulations were performed using
several rigorous solvers for the Helmholtz equations, and with a perturbation
theory. The analysis relies on synchrotron data, as well as data from atomic
force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The aim of this article is
to draw the attention of the optical community to the synchrotron measurements
as a nanometrology tool for the modern optical elements.

Abstract: Synchronization is ubiquitous across a wide range of fields. Subharmonic
entrainment (SHE) is a nonlinear synchronization phenomenon that results in a
locking oscillator at a frequency of an external periodic forcing signal with a
fraction of the oscillator frequency. Beyond the fundamentals of nonlinear
dynamics, SHE has a range of practical applications from stabilizing ultrafast
laser pulses to optimizing control in various engineering and natural systems.
However, the vectorial nature of SHE remains elusive. Here, we present the
results of a theoretical and experimental study of a vector type of subharmonic
entrainment (VSHE) using a passively mode-locked fiber laser as a testbed. We
unveil the mechanism of vectorial SHE, in which weak external signals can
entrain internal laser dynamics through vectorial coupling. Vectorial SHE
presents in the form of synchronization between the subharmonic of
mode-locking-driven oscillations and continuous wave (CW) signal through an
evolving state of polarization. This CW signal, driven by the internal dynamics
of the injected signal, causes VSHE with the frequencies ratios of multiples of
ten, resulting in a partially mode-locking regime operation. Our findings offer
new control techniques over mode-locking and additional dimension such as
polarization states.

Motivation: The study of instanton solutions in Yang-Mills theory and their extensions in string theory is motivated by exploring rich mathematical structures and dualities that might offer deeper insights into quantum field theories and string theory.

Method: The authors utilized off-shell supersymmetric harmonic space constructions, building upon foundational work by Galperin and Sokatchev, and integrating Ali and Ilahi's complementary models to create a more comprehensive framework.

Result: They present a detailed harmonic superspace formalism for the complementary model, expanding on Witten's original framework and contributing to the understanding of dual models in supersymmetric theories.

Conclusion: This work advances the theoretical framework for ADHM instantons, providing a more robust formalism for studying dualities in (0,4) supersymmetric models, which could be crucial for furthering our understanding of string theory and related areas in theoretical physics.

Abstract: ADHM Yang-Mills instantons are extended field theoretical objects. These are
more general than the more familiar 't Hooft Yang-Mills instantons. Their
counter parts exist in string theory in terms of sigma models. Nearly three
decades ago Witten constructed a (0,4) supersymmetric linear sigma model
incorporating ADHM instantons. Witten's construction was in component form.
Galperin and Sokatchev constructed the corresponding off-shell supersymmetric
version using the harmonic superspace. Recently Ali and Ilahi constructed an
ADHM instanton linear sigma model that is complementary, in the sense of being
dual, to the original model constructed by Witten. Full (0,4) supersymmetric
off-shell harmonic superspace formalism for Ali-Ilahi's complementary ADHM
instanton sigma model is developed in this note.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a field redefinition in the AdS/CFT correspondence linking Weyl dilaton and AdS brane setups for conformal symmetry breaking.

Motivation: Understanding the AdS/CFT correspondence is crucial as it helps link higher-dimensional theories to lower-dimensional conformal field theories, providing insights into quantum gravity and string theory. This paper seems to contribute to the understanding by introducing a novel field redefinition and extending the mapping to more general cases.

Method: The authors use a variational principle, field redefinition, and analysis of equations of motion to construct the duality between conformal galileons and DBI galileons in various dimensions. They also thoroughly analyze the structure of Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions to resolve potential puzzles.

Result: The paper successfully constructs the duality between conformal galileons and DBI galileons across different dimensions, reconciling concerns about Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions. This dual formulation likely offers new perspectives on the interplay between conformal symmetry breaking and gravitational effects in dual field theories.

Conclusion: The authors conclude by emphasizing the significance of their field redefinition in the AdS/CFT correspondence, suggesting potential impacts on future research into the dual descriptions of conformal field theories with broken conformal symmetry and their gravitational duals in AdS space. They also hint at broader implications for understanding quantum gravity and the AdS/CFT correspondence itself, calling for further exploration of these insights.

Abstract: The AdS/CFT equivalence transformation is a field redefinition that relates
the Weyl dilaton and AdS brane realizations of broken conformal symmetry.
Acting on theories with second order equations of motion, it maps the conformal
galileons to the DBI galileons for a flat brane probing an AdS bulk. Here we
extend this map to arbitrary dimensions and resolve an apparent puzzle
regarding the Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions.

exchange. In the low-temperature limit, our result reduces correctly to the
vacuum $(n+2)$-point block in the comb channel. The corresponding expressions
can be written as a series of terminating hypergeometric functions or
equivalently, a series of weighted SU(2) spin-networks. Alternatively,
functions adapted to the SU(2,2) representation are introduced and some

Abstract: We embark on a systematic study of continuous non-invertible symmetries,
focusing on 1+1d CFTs. We describe a generalized version of Noether's theorem,
where continuous non-invertible symmetries are associated to
$\textit{non-local}$ conserved currents: point-like operators attached to
extended topological defects. The generalized Noether's theorem unifies several
constructions of continuous non-invertible symmetries in the literature, and
allows us to exhibit many more examples in diverse theories of interest. We
first review known examples which are non-intrinsic (i.e., invertible up to
gauging), and then describe $\textit{new}$ examples in Wess-Zumino-Witten
models and products of minimal models. For some of these new examples, we show
that these continuous non-invertible symmetries are intrinsic if we demand that
a certain global symmetry is preserved. The continuous non-invertible
symmetries in products of minimal models also allow us to construct new
examples of defect conformal manifolds in a single copy of a minimal model.
Finally, we comment on continuous non-invertible symmetries in higher
dimensions.

TL;DR: Summary of the paper: The paper calculates the gravitational on-shell action for a finite, spherically symmetric causal diamond in (d+2)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and finds it proportional to the area of the bifurcate horizon. They identify this action as a partition function in Euclidean gravity, thermal with respect to a modular Hamiltonian. Using thermodynamic identities, they determine the mean and variance of the modular Hamiltonian, showing ⟨K⟩=⟨(ΔK)^2⟩=A_B/(4G_N). They also explore the implications of modular fluctuations on spacetime geometry and particle phase shifts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper uses advanced concepts from general relativity and thermodynamics to explore the relationship between gravitational action, horizon areas, and thermodynamic properties, which is a significant topic in understanding quantum gravity and black hole thermodynamics.

Method: The authors compute the on-shell gravitational action using methods from general relativity and Euclidean path integrals. They identify the action as a partition function and associate it with a modular Hamiltonian. Using thermodynamic identities, they derive the mean and variance of this Hamiltonian.

Result: Key results include the proportionality of the on-shell action to the horizon area, identification of the partition function as a thermal system with a modular Hamiltonian, and the determination of the mean and variance of the Hamiltonian, leading to ⟨K⟩=⟨(ΔK)^2⟩=A_B/(4G_N). Additionally, they analyze the effects of these modular fluctuations on spacetime geometry and particle phase shifts.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel thermodynamic interpretation of gravitational on-shell actions and establishes a direct connection between the modular Hamiltonian and the area of the horizon, offering insights into the quantum nature of spacetime and its thermodynamic properties.

Abstract: We compute a gravitational on-shell action of a finite, spherically symmetric
causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, finding it is
proportional to the area of the bifurcate horizon $A_{\mathcal{B}}$. We then
identify the on-shell action with the saddle point of the Euclidean
gravitational path integral, which is naturally interpreted as a partition
function. This partition function is thermal with respect to a modular
Hamiltonian $K$. Consequently, we determine, from the on-shell action using
standard thermodynamic identities, both the mean and variance of the modular
Hamiltonian, finding $\langle K \rangle = \langle (\Delta K)^2 \rangle =
\frac{A_{\mathcal{B}}}{4 G_N}$. Finally, we show that modular fluctuations give
rise to fluctuations in the geometry, and compute the associated phase shift of
massless particles traversing the diamond under such fluctuations.

Motivation: The paper's focus on AdS/CFT correspondence with operator quenches and random matrix theory could provide insights into high-energy physics and quantum gravity, particularly fluctuations in boundary theories and dual bulk configurations.

Method: The authors employ the AdS/CFT correspondence, inserting scalar fields and applying a hard wall cutoff. They compute boundary observables' time evolution and compare correlation functions to Gaussian ensembles to infer system behavior.

Result: They find that for heavy operators, boundary two-point functions exhibit GUE-like fluctuations, suggesting universal behavior in confined AdS setups. Similar results are observed in a BTZ black hole scenario.

Conclusion: This work contributes to understanding operator quenches and boundary correlations in confined AdS and black hole backgrounds, linking them to random matrix theory, which may aid in studying chaotic and entropic phenomena in quantum systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared
by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to
operator quenches for free fields in AdS. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we
compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual states. We then
introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff,
creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and
analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By
comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the
deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show
that for sufficiently heavy operators the fluctuations approach quite close
those of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Finally, we extend our analysis
to the compact BTZ black hole and its hard wall deformation, finding
qualitatively similar behavior.

Motivation: 深入研究复杂费曼积分的结构有助于提高粒子物理计算的精度，这项工作明确了解决办法的理论基础。

Method: 利用K3几何、eps因子化基底、K3周期和有理函数，应用twisted cohomology方法来简化积分关系，减少函数数量。

Conclusion: 这项研究为计算更复杂费曼积分提供了新方法，未来可能扩展到更多几何结构。

Abstract: We present a system of canonical differential equations satisfied by the
three-loop banana integrals with four distinct non-zero masses in $D = 2-2\eps$
dimensions. Together with the initial condition in the small-mass limit, this
provides all the ingredients to find analytic results for three-loop banana
integrals in terms of iterated integrals to any desired order in the
dimensional regulator. To obtain this result, we rely on recent advances in
understanding the K3 geometry underlying these integrals and in how to
construct rotations to an $\eps$-factorized basis. This rotation typically
involves the introduction of objects defined as integrals of (derivatives of)
K3 periods and rational functions. We apply and extend a method based on
results from twisted cohomology to identify relations among these functions,
which allows us to reduce their number considerably. We expect that the methods
that we have applied here will prove useful to compute further multiloop
multiscale Feynman integrals attached to non-trivial geometries.

*Emil Albrychiewicz,Andrés Franco Valiente,Christopher Stites*

TL;DR: This paper explores higher-dimensional tropological sigma models, showing they admit complex nested Maslov dequantizations and filtration structures, leading to new invariants on filtered manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper generalizes 2D sigma models to higher dimensions, introducing new structures and symmetries that could have implications for enumerative geometry and symplectic topology.

Method: Mathematical analysis, classification of models, construction of new invariants, Lie algebra determination.

Result: Classification for 4D targets, filtered manifolds, noncompact nilpotent Lie algebra symmetry, GW invariants on filtered spaces.

Conclusion: Higher-dimensional models lead to new invariants and richer symmetries, expanding the framework of sigma models in geometry and topology.

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of tropological (tropical topological) sigma
models on higher dimensional target spaces and show that higher dimensional
spaces explicitly admit nested Maslov dequantizations which lead to nontrivial
anisotropic filtration structures. We provide a classification of all
inequivalent tropological sigma models that can be constructed for the case of
4D targets and show that, generically, the corresponding sigma-models are not
defined on foliated geometries like in the 2D case but instead are defined on
filtered manifolds. We find that the nontrivial filtration structures lead to
enhanced global symmetries characterized by noncompact nilpotent Lie algebras
given by the 4 dimensional step 3 Engel algebra on the space of fields. We
provide a Nilmanifold lattice regularization of the noncompact symmetry group
and use this Nilmanifold symmetry to construct a natural equivariant extension
of the tropological sigma model. We conjecture that these equivariant
tropological sigma models are associated with a new version of GW invariants on
filtered manifolds known as \textit{filtered Gromov Witten invariants

### [138] [On the reggeon model with the pomeron and odderon: singularities with non-zero masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23086)
*M. A. Braun,E. M. Kuzminskii,M. I. Vyazovsky*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper applies the Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in a non-trivial transverse space, using the renormalization group technique in single-loop approximation. The model considers different bare intercepts and slopes for the pomeron and odderon. By varying the intercepts towards their critical values (in line with the Froissart bound), the study identifies singularities in the form of non-trivial branch points near five fixed points. However, the model becomes non-physical when the bare intercepts exceed their critical values due to the violation of projectile-target symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to delve into advanced theoretical aspects of particle physics, specifically focusing on the behavior of hadronic interactions using Regge theory and renormalization group methods. The motivation could be to explore how these models can predict and explain phenomena like Pomeron trajectories and their limitations, contributing to a deeper understanding of hadronic forces.

Method: The authors used the Regge-Gribov model as a foundation, employing the renormalization group technique in a single-loop approximation. They considered the presence of both Pomeron and odderon with different bare parameters and studied their behavior as intercepts approach critical values influenced by the Froissart bound. Through this, they identified singularities near fixed points and assessed the implications for the model's physicality under varying intercept conditions. The methodology is grounded in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) principles and non-perturbative effects, likely requiring advanced computational tools,

Result: The key findings indicate phase transitions in the system characterized by non-trivial branch points, which complicate the physical interpretation of the model beyond certain critical intercept values. The study reveals that the model remains valid only when the bare intercepts are below their critical thresholds, as exceeding these leads to a breakdown in symmetry and thus the model's feasibility is restricted in such scenarios. These results contribute to understanding the limitations and applicability of the Regge-Gribov model within the broader framework of hadron physics and QCD. The singularities identified suggest new avenues for exploring beyond the current model's capabilities in describing strong interaction dynamics. Overall, the findings highlight the critical role of intercept values in maintaining the model's physical consistency within the studied framework.

Conclusion: The paper successfully applies the Regge-Gribov model to analyze the behavior of the Pomeron and Odderon in a non-trivial transverse space, utilizing the renormalization group technique to understand the system's phase transitions and singularities. By identifying critical fixed points and analyzing their vicinity, the study examines the conditions under which the model remains a valid physical framework. Ultimately, the research demonstrates that the Pomeron-Odderon system must respect certain symmetry constraints to ensure its applicability in describing hadronic interactions within the confines of the Froissart bound and QCD principles. The conclusions emphasize the importance of these constraints and provide insights into the potential for extending the model to more complex systems.

Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial
transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique in the
single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different
bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below
to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied.
The singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase
transition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous
publication. Since new phases violate the projectile-target symmetry the model
is found non-physical for the bare intercepts above their critical value.

Conclusion: 该研究推广了路径积分方法并解开了算子非对角化之间的关系，提供了一种有效的新方法来分析复杂物理现象。

Abstract: Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problems are ubiquitous in theoretical physics,
with quantum-mechanical applications typically confined to cases for which the
eigenfunctions are required to be normalizable on the real axis. However,
seeking the spectrum of resonant states for metastable potentials or
comprehending $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric scenarios requires the broader study of
eigenvalue problems for which the boundary conditions are provided in specific
angular sectors of the complex plane. We generalize the conventional path
integral treatment to such nonstandard boundary value problems, allowing the
extraction of spectral information using functional methods. We find that the
arising functional integrals are naturally defined on a complexified
integration contour, encapsulating the demanded sectorial boundary conditions
of the associated eigenvalue problem. The attained results are applied to the
analysis of resonant ground-state energies, through which we identify the
previously elusive one-to-one correspondence between decay rates derived from
real-time quantum tunneling dynamics and those obtained via the Euclidean
instanton method.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that AdS black holes possess the basic
characteristics of a standard thermodynamic system. Concurrently, the
thermodynamic properties of spacetimes featuring multiple horizons with
distinct radiation temperatures have also attracted research interest. In this
work, considering the high-order quantum electrodynamics (QED) correction, we
initially establish an equivalent thermodynamic system for the coexistence
region of black hole and cosmological horizons. On this basis, we conduct a
detailed investigation into the thermodynamic properties of this dual-horizon
coexistence region. Our results demonstrate that this equivalent thermodynamic
system exhibits van der Waals-like thermodynamic behavior. Furthermore, we
introduce a nonlinear parameter $\gamma$ to analyze its impact on phase
transitions within the equivalent thermodynamic system. Under specific
conditions, the system undergoes first- or second-order phase transitions for
$\gamma=0$, and zeroth- or second-order phase transitions for $\gamma\neq0$.
Finally, by utilizing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy within
the thermodynamic topological framework for black holes, we extend this
methodology to investigate the topological properties of de Sitter (dS)
spacetime. We compute the topological number characterizing the coexistence
region of dual horizons in Euler-Heisenberg (EH) dS spacetime using equivalent
thermodynamic state parameters. Additionally, we investigate the influence of
the nonlinear parameter $\gamma$ on the thermodynamic characteristics of the
equivalent system.

Conclusion: 研究结果为引力散射中的黑体与量子场论的相关行为提供了见解。

Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional
conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested
in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local
operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to
determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a
local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy
relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the
presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant
bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the
quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the
quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational
scattering involving black holes.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper studies constraints on large-field inflation using the Swampland Distance Conjecture, showing it imposes tighter upper limits on tensor-to-scalar ratios compared to current observational data, distinguishing it from the Lyth bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how quantum gravity effects can constrain inflationary models and differentiate them, particularly focusing on the Swampland Conjectures as theoretical tools.

Method: Analyzing large-field inflation models through quantum gravity consistency using the Swampland Distance Conjecture to derive amplitude limits of primordial gravitational waves.

Result: The Swampland Distance Conjecture provides more stringent upper limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio than current observations, serving as a theoretical discriminator among inflation models.

Conclusion: This highlights the role of Swampland criteria in theoretical model selection, complementing observational data without relying on empirical results.

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed
to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum
gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance
Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial
gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides
a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound
on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play
complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We
demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the
Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on
the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the
cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland
criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models,
independent of empirical data.

Conclusion: 论文扩展了双元组研究，提出了一种构建超对称磁单极的新方法，可能在高能物理中有应用价值。

Abstract: We construct Kaluza-Klein monopole solutions with scalar hair provied by a
massive complex scalar field multiplet that minimally couples to
five-dimensional Einstein gravity. Writing the scalar field multiplet in terms
of the Wigner D-matrices, we introduce the ansatz of the scalar multiplet
compatible with the symmetries of the Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole, on which the
scalar hair grows. We give the ansatz for a multiplet with arbitrary number of
components, whereas we show numerical solutions of the hairy Kaluza-Klein
monopole specifically for the cases of scalar triplet and quadruplet. These
generaize the preceding study on a doublet \cite{Brihaye:2023vox}. We find that
the range of the mass and angular momentum of the hairy solutions are larger
for higher multiplets.

any non-$\varepsilon$-factorising terms. This procedure is algorithmic and at
no point relies on prior knowledge of the underlying geometry.

*Masamichi Miyaji,Shan-Ming Ruan,Shono Shibuya,Kazuyoshi Yano*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores holographic complexity and its universal behavior by introducing generating functions. Using generating functions, they find that complexity grows linearly over time, with a plateau at late times due to quantum chaos, all originating from random matrix theory and spectral structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explain the universal behavior of holographic complexity using generating functions, drawing inspiration from quantum chaos and random matrix theory.

Method: They introduce generating functions, analyze their spectral properties, and use the residue theorem to derive the growth pattern of complexity.

Result: They discover that complexity follows a slope-ramp-plateau structure, similar to quantum systems, involving linear growth and late-time saturation from spectral level repulsion.

Conclusion: This provides a deeper understanding of how complexity evolves in holographic systems, linking it to quantum chaos and random matrix statistics.

Abstract: Holographic complexity, as the bulk dual of quantum complexity, encodes the
geometric structure of black hole interiors. Motivated by the
complexity=anything proposal, we introduce the spectral representation for
generating functions associated with codimension-one and codimension-zero
holographic complexity measures. These generating functions exhibit a universal
slope-ramp-plateau structure, analogous to the spectral form factor in chaotic
quantum systems. In such systems, quantum complexity evolves universally,
displaying long-time linear growth followed by saturation at late times. By
employing the generating function formalism, we demonstrate that this universal
behavior originates from random matrix universality in spectral statistics and
from a particular pole structure of the matrix elements of the generating
functions in the energy eigenbasis. Using the residue theorem, we prove that
the existence of this pole structure is both a necessary and sufficient
condition for the linear growth of complexity measures. Furthermore, we show
that the late-time saturation plateau arises directly from the spectral level
repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos.

TL;DR: We extend Krylov complexity to handle multiple generators, creating a framework for generalized Krylov complexity. This measures state complexity under continuous symmetries. Different transformation directions affect complexity, and we compare it to geometric approaches. We develop an orthogonalization algorithm and demonstrate its use through examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to aim to understand quantum state complexity, perhaps for applications in quantum information or computation, by extending existing complexity measures to more general scenarios. The focus is on continuous symmetries and transformations, which could offer deeper insights into the structure of quantum evolutions.

Method: The authors use mathematical tools like operator theory and network models. They build on existing concepts like Krylov complexity and Nielsen's geometric approach, adding new algorithms such as the generalized orthogonalization method.

Result: The framework they create provides a way to quantify and compare complexity in different scenarios, which could lead to optimizing quantum processes or understanding complexity classes in physics.

Conclusion: Their method offers a new angle to study quantum state complexity, potentially applicable to various areas where symmetry transformations are central to dynamics. The paper's approach and examples suggest a solid contribution to the field.

Abstract: We extend the concept of Krylov complexity to include general unitary
evolutions involving multiple generators. This generalization enables us to
formulate a framework for generalized Krylov complexity, which serves as a
measure of the complexity of states associated with continuous symmetries
within a model. Furthermore, we investigate scenarios where different
directions of transformation lead to varying degrees of complexity, which can
be compared to geometric approaches to understanding complexity, such as
Nielsen complexity. In this context, we introduce a generalized
orthogonalization algorithm and delineate its computational framework, which is
structured as a network of orthogonal blocks rather than a simple linear chain.
Additionally, we provide explicit evaluations of specific illustrative examples
to demonstrate the practical application of this framework.

Abstract: As an exact count of protected states, the superconformal index provides a
powerful probe into holography and quantum aspects of gravity, reproducing the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of supersymmetric AdS black holes in the large-$N$
limit. As a step toward understanding quantum black hole microstates, we study
the finite-$N$ index of the 3d ADHM quiver gauge theory, a UV description of
the 3d $\mathcal N=8$ SCFT dual to M-theory on AdS$_4 \times S^7$. In this
note, we analyze both microcanonical and canonical features of the
superconformal index. By computing the index to sufficiently high orders, we
identify signatures of quantum black hole states in the finite-$N$ spectrum of
the ADHM quiver, which align with the leading large-$N$ contribution reflecting
the holographic dual black hole entropy. Furthermore, we introduce the
complex-$\beta$ phase diagram of the index, which exhibits distinct peaks
potentially associated with different gravitational saddles. To enable
high-order computations, we employ the factorized index and also examine its
Higgs branch Hilbert series limit. Our results demonstrate that the finite-$N$
index encodes rich information about black hole microstates and their quantum
gravitational interpretation.

### [150] [Graded Unitarity in the SCFT/VOA Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23781)
*Arash Arabi Ardehali,Christopher Beem,Madalena Lemos,Leonardo Rastelli*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new concept called graded unitarity for vertex algebras, motivated by the correspondence between 4D N=2 SCFTs and 2D vertex algebras. They propose that when a 4D theory is unitary, the associated 2D vertex algebra exhibits graded unitarity, which isn't the conventional sense. They aim to classify such vertex algebras, focusing on Virasoro and affine Kac-Moody types. Their results show that only certain central charges and levels are compatible with graded unitarity, aligning with known 4D cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds upon the known correspondence between 4D N=2 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) and vertex algebras, particularly Virasoro and affine Kac-Moody. It addresses the unique structural properties of these vertex algebras, especially the deviation from conventional unitarity observed when the parent 4D theory is unitary. The authors propose a generalized definition of unitarity, which they call graded unitarity, to better capture the implications of 4D unitarity in the 2D vertex algebra framework.

Method: This is a theoretical work where the authors define a new concept, graded unitarity, and then investigate the implications of this definition by studying vertex algebras related to Virasoro and affine Kac-Moody algebras. They likely perform an analysis of the mathematical structures involved, such as analyzing the conditions under which these vertex algebras satisfy the graded unitarity criteria. The authors also take the first steps towards a classification program, which likely involves enumerating or categorizing the vertex algebras that meet these criteria based on known results from 4D SCFTs.

Result: The key results include the definition of graded unitarity and a classification of vertex algebras with this property. Specifically, they find that only vertex algebras with specific central charges for Virasoro (the (2,p) series) and particular boundary admissible levels for affine Kac-Moody algebras like sl_2 and sl_3 satisfy the conditions for graded unitarity. These findings precisely align with the known examples of vertex algebras arising from 4D N=2 SCFTs. This suggests a deep connection between the unitarity of the parent theories and the generalized unitarity of their corresponding 2D vertex algebras.

Conclusion: The authors have successfully introduced and defined graded unitarity for vertex algebras, providing a new framework that captures the unitarity aspects of 4D N=2 SCFTs in a 2D setting. They have made progress towards classifying the vertex algebras that can arise from such theories. The results not only align with existing knowledge but also offer a pathway for further understanding the correspondence between 4D and 2D conformal field theories through the lens of vertex algebra unitarity.

Abstract: Vertex algebras that arise from four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$
superconformal field theories inherit a collection of novel structural
properties from their four-dimensional ancestors. Crucially, when the parent
SCFT is unitary, the corresponding vertex algebra is not unitary in the
conventional sense. In this paper, we motivate and define a generalized notion
of unitarity for vertex algebras that we call \emph{graded unitarity}, and
which captures the consequences of four-dimensional unitarity under this
correspondence. We also take the first steps towards a classification program
for graded-unitary vertex algebras whose underlying vertex algebras are
Virasoro or affine Kac--Moody vertex algebras. Remarkably, under certain
natural assumptions about the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration for these vertex
algebras, we show that only the $(2,p)$ central charges for Virasoro VOAs and
boundary admissible levels for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$
Kac--Moody vertex algebras can possibly be compatible with graded unitarity.
These are precisely the cases of these vertex algebras that are known to arise
from four dimensions.
