I introduce four principles that license only configuration relative predication, grounding outcomes in physical measurement geometry while preserving objectivity. Applying these principles uniformly dissolves each puzzle without new physics or ad hoc interpretive machinery. Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker theorem are reframed not as dynamical mysteries but as constraints on permissible explanatory structure, evidence that intrinsic-outcome semantics is incompatible with empirical reality. The result is a relational objectivity that avoids both naive property realism and observer subjectivism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u82e5\u5e72\u7ecf\u5178\u6096\u8bba\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u4e92\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u5916\u5316\u4e3a\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u6761\u539f\u5219\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u5173\u8054\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ed3\u679c\u4f9d\u7269\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u800c\u5b9a\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5ba2\u89c2\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u7edf\u4e00\u5316\u89e3\u6240\u6709\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u589e\u7269\u7406\u6216\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u673a\u5668\u3002\u8d1d\u5c14\u5b9a\u7406\u548c Kochen-Specker\u5b9a\u7406\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5bb9\u8bb8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u662f relational \u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e3b\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6f84\u6e05\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7ecf\u5178\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u6761\u9650\u5236\u5173\u8054\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u5168\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u5404\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b50\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u90fd\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u662f relational \u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e3b\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u89c2\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e3b\u4e49\u5e76\u5b58\u662f\u5bf9\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u7684\u5426\u5b9a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u89c2\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u3002"}}

However, benchmarking VQAs is difficult due to their stochastic behavior and the lack of standardized performance criteria. This work introduces a general framework for evaluating VQAs applied to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. The framework uses three complementary metrics: feasibility, quality, and reproducibility. It also introduces a quality diagram that visualizes trade-offs between success probability and computational resources. Reproducibility is formalized using Shannon entropy, and a decision rule is defined for selecting algorithms under resource constraints. As a demonstration, the framework is applied to several VQAs using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) cost functions and different shot counts on a 16-qubit QUBO instance. The results show how the framework supports systematic benchmarking and provides a foundation for adaptive algorithm selection in hybrid quantum-classical workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here we propose an information-backflow phase-diagram approach that places \\emph{quantum entanglement revivals} and \\emph{classical entropy overshoots} on the same footing through a common backflow functional $N_I=\\int_{\\dot I>0}\\dot I\\,dt$. On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(\u03b1)}_{qe}(t)=\\frac14[E_\u03b1(-\u03bb^\u03b1t^\u03b1)]^2\\sin^2(\u03c9t)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $\u03b1\\simeq 1/2$ in the $(\u03b1,\u03c9/\u03bb)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $\u0394H$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex. To strengthen the quantum--classical symmetry, we further introduce a \\emph{fractional Mittag--Leffler memory kernel} in the classical dynamics and show that an analogous backflow transition emerges around $\u03b1\\simeq 1/2$, indicating that the boundary originates from the kernel's mathematical structure rather than from quantumness per se. Overall, our results provide a compact, model-agnostic route to classify non-Markovianity by phase diagrams of information backflow and to interpret them via a shared embedding narrative: memory stored in hidden degrees of freedom returns to the observed sector as non-monotonic information flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u6d41\u76f8\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u56de\u590d\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u71b5\u8d85\u5f71\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u7684\u56de\u6d41\u51fd\u6570NI=\u222b_{\beingating}dotI dt\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u2018\u56de\u6d41\u9636\u6bb5\u2019\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u6d41\u76f8\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u56de\u590d\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u71b5\u8d85\u5f71\u73b0\u8c61\u653e\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u03b1\u22481/2\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u660e\u663e\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u6d41\u76f8\u56fe\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8bd5\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u800c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u6d41\u76f8\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u5206\u6790\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u90fd\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6027\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u9636\u7684\u4e24\u6001\u8017\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08TFD\uff09\u4e2d\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6001\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5206\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u56de\u6d41\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u03b1\u22481/2\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u9636Mittag\u2013Leffler\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u03b1\u22481/2\u65f6\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u56de\u6d41\u76f8\u56fe\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u03b1=0.5\u9644\u8fd1\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u6570\u9636Mittag\u2013Leffler\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u56fe\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u6d41\u76f8\u56fe\u6765\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u8fd8\u662f\u7ecf\u5178\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

The TESs calorimeter of the telescope will be readout by a time-division multiplexer (TDM) SQUID readout system. We develop a two-stage dc-SQUID amplifier circuit, comprising an input-stage SQUID with 4 SQUID cells and a series SQUID array (SSA) with 100 SQUID cells.

We assess the system noise at $300$ $mK$ in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator (ADR). The the measured magnetic flux noise of the two-stage SQUID circuit system is approximately $0.3$ $\u03bc\u03a6_{0}/\\sqrt{Hz}$ at $10$ $kHz$.

This represents an important milestone for fully variational SIC energy functionals, which have been shown to improve the prediction of the properties of atomic, molecular and solid state systems in general, in both ground and excited states. However, it depends on the system and property of the system whether it is beneficial to scale the SIC correction by a factor of one-half, which makes the application of SIC inconsistent. In the limit of a single electron the SIC exactly cancels the self interaction error, but overcorrects the error in regions of high density where there is large overlap between occupied orbitals. The newly implemented local scaling function, $z(\\mathbf{r})$, which is based on an iso-orbital indicator derived from considering the kinetic energy density in the iso-electron and many electron case, and takes into account that the orbitals are complex, naturally scales the SIC correction from $0\\leq z(\\mathbf{r}) \\leq 1$ in regions of high and low (isolated orbital) electron density. The locally scaled and fully variational SIC framework is general and applicable to atomic, molecular and solid-state systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653e\u81ea\u6d3d\uff08SIC\uff09\u52bf\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6742\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653e\u51fd\u6570\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u52a8\u80fd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5c06SIC\u4fee\u6b63\u4ece0\u52301\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u56fa\u4f53\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbSIC\u52bf\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u56fa\u4f53\u7b49\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653eSIC\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u8fc7\u6821\u6b63\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653eSIC\u52bf\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u590d\u6742\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u52a8\u80fd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653e\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u56fa\u4f53\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aSIC\u52bf\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

The most common scenario deals with particles that tend to be centered on the brightest part of the optical trap. Consequently, the optical forces keep the particle away from the dark zones of the beam. However, this is not the case when a focused doughnut_shaped beam generates on_axis trapping. In this system, the particle is centered on the intensity minima of the laser beam and the bright annular part lies on the periphery of the particle. Researchers have shown great interest in this phenomenon due to its advantage of reducing light interaction with trapped particles and the intriguing increase in the trapping strength. This work presents experimental and theoretical results that extend the analysis of on_axis trapping with light vortex beams. Specifically, in our experiments, we trap micron_sized spherical silica (SiO2) particles in water and we measure, through the power spectrum density method, the trap stiffness constant \\k{appa} generated by vortex beams with different topological charge orders. The optical forces are calculated from the exact solutions of the electromagnetic fields provided by the generalized Lorentz_Mie theory. We show a remarkable agreement between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurements of \\k{appa}. Moreover, our numerical model gives us information about the electromagnetic fields inside the particle, offering valuable insights into the influence of the electromagnetic fields present in the vortex beam trapping scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5149\u6355\u83b7\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u3001\u7ecf\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u3002\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u573a\u666f\u662f\u5fae\u7c92\u88ab\u5149\u7ebf\u5438\u5f15\u5230\u5149\u9677\u9631\u7684\u6700\u660e\u4eae\u533a\u57df\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u8f74\u5411\u5149\u9677\u9631\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5fae\u7c92\u88ab\u5438\u5f15\u5230\u5149\u675f\u7684\u6697\u533a\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5149\u65cb\u6da1\u675f\u6355\u83b7\u4e2d\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u5149\u9677\u9631\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u65cb\u5ea6\u7684\u5149\u65cb\u6da1\u675f\u7684\u6355\u83b7\u521a\u6027\u5e38\u6570\u03ba\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u73bb\u7483\u5fae\u7403\u9897\u7c92\u5728\u6c34\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u03ba\u503c\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179-\u7c73\u7406\u8bba\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5149\u65cb\u6da1\u675f\u4e2d\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u5bf9\u5fae\u7c92\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u65cb\u6da1\u675f\u5728\u8f74\u5411\u5149\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u6355\u83b7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5149\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5fae\u7c92\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u65cb\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5fae\u7c92\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u521a\u6027\u03ba\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u4e49\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179-\u7c73\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5149\u65cb\u6da1\u675f\u5728\u8f74\u5411\u5149\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u6355\u83b7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5149\u65cb\u5ea6\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u65cb\u6da1\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5149\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5149\u7ebf\u5bf9\u5fae\u7c92\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

The corresponding theory of reaction-diffusion dynamics combines ideal diffusion with nonlinear reactions, resulting in patterns when species diffuse at different rates and reactions are sufficiently nonlinear. However, real systems are more complex and particularly involve physical interactions between constituents. While such interactions can promote patterns, we here show that they can also induce dynamic, chaotic patterns. These patterns exhibit well-defined length and time scales, which result from cycles of droplet coarsening and fission. The dynamical patterns combine properties of traditional Turing patterns and chemically active droplets, which emerge for strong physical interactions.

Crucially, in both protocols the cooling capability is limited by dissipatively induced diffusion processes. The resulting quadratic scaling of the cooling time with system size is corroborated also analytically using mean-field approximations and a purely classical random walk model. Furthermore, we find that the engineered protocol admits a unique and stable dark state, which contributes to an ongoing discussion regarding the applicability of dissipative state preparation to many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u5907\u62d3\u6251\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u80fd\u529b\u90fd\u56e0\u8017\u6563\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u51b7\u5374\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5448\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c engineered \u5e76\u975e\u9002\u914d\u534f\u8bae\u5141\u8bb8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6697\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8017\u6563\u6027\u5728\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5236\u5907\u62d3\u6251\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4fdd\u6301\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u534f\u8bae", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8017\u6563\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u51b7\u5374\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8017\u6563\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f"}}

Hofmann", "Alexander Wietek"], "title": "Cooper Condensation and Pair Wave Functions in Strongly Correlated Electrons", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.", "AI": {"tldr":

Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours.

We implement dual-tone heterodyne detection, achieving a minimum detectable field strength on the order of uV/cm and a sensitivity in the sub-uV/cm/Hz^1/2 regime, while extending the operational bandwidth up to 3 GHz. Through systematic characterization of frequency and power dependencies, we identify optimal operating conditions to minimize power broadening in the resonant AT regime and maximize sensitivity in the far-off-resonance AC Stark regime.

However, in 2D static tight-binding systems, perfectly flat bands can only exist in the topologically trivial phase, as characterized by a zero Chern number. Here we show that by introducing periodic driving into a 2D photonic Lieb lattice composed of coupled microring resonators, the resulting Floquet topological insulator can host perfectly flat bands with nontrivial topology. In particular, by tracking the evolution of the flat-band modes over each cycle, we show that the non-Abelian displacements of the flat-band modes are characterized by a nontrivial quantized helicity even though the quasi-energy bands have zero Chern number. The helical motion of the flat-band modes can be described by a braiding of the world lines of their trajectories, with a nontrivial winding number directly connected to the helicity. We also propose a scheme to experimentally measure the quantized non-Abelian helicity in a microring lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field.

Using the quantum defect theory, we obtain analytical solutions for both repulsive and attractive $1/r^3$ interactions. The obtained discrete-scale-invariant energies and wave functions, validated by excellent agreement with numerical results, provide a natural framework for describing the universality of Efimov states in mixed dimension. Specifically, we consider a three-body system consisting of two heavy particles with large dipole moments confined to a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and resonantly interacting with an unconfined light particle.

To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities.

By imposing such twists, the original lattice topology is preserved, while mirror symmetries are strategically broken through modifying a single geometric parameter, allowing wave characteristics to be adjusted without additional resonators or mass augmentation. The complex-valued Bloch-Floquet analysis reveals that twisting activates two distinct wave attenuation mechanisms: Bragg-type band gaps associated with periodicity-induced scattering, and polarization-dependent band gaps arising from longitudinal-torsional mode coupling and avoided crossings. To obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into these mechanisms, a simplified analytical model with coupled translational and rotational degrees of freedom is considered. The finite-element wave transmission calculations are experimentally validated on SLA-printed three-cell specimens, for which wave attenuation reaches up to 20 dB within the predicted band-gap frequencies. Note that high prediction accuracy requires accounting for viscoelastic material behavior, underscoring the importance of material behavior on the wave propagation characteristics.

Despite rapid progress in optical performance, most PDRC systems remain limited by rigid, fragile, or planar substrates, restricting their use on flexible, curved, or wearable surfaces. Here, we report a biocompatible and structurally robust PDRC system integrated onto a commercial rapid-curing fiberglass cast, a conformal substrate widely used in orthopedic and industrial applications. The cooling architecture adopts a bilayer polymer design consisting of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) adhesion layer and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer, both embedded with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) ceramic particles derived from processed animal bone waste. The bio-derived CPP simultaneously enables broadband solar scattering and high mid-infrared emittance, while offering sustainability and biocompatibility advantages. The resulting composite exhibits over 90% solar reflectance and achieves up to 15 C sub-ambient cooling under direct outdoor sunlight.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discusses a flexible and biocompatible PDRC (passive daytime radiative cooling) system for wearable or wearable surfaces with conformal shapes.

After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology.

Path-integral methods are developed to study ensemble averages and thermal Green's functions of general operators, with an arbitrary number of points, in all interacting gauge theories. These methods cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalisms. Generalized Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) conditions are obtained both in coordinate and in momentum space for operators in general representations of the Lorentz and internal symmetry group. This allows us to obtain all thermal propagators including those of gauge fields and Faddeev-Popov ghosts. By analyzing all interactions in detail, it is shown that, in perturbation theory, only the propagators are affected by the average angular momentum and the chemical potentials, the vertices remain unmodified.

Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds.

While electron-neutral atom collisions are tractable using the standard Riccati-Bessel wavefunctions in the asymptotic region, electron-ion collisions face challenges due to the extended range of the screened Coulomb potential, which lacks analytical solutions or numerical code packages for asymptotic regular and irregular wavefunctions. We introduce an R-matrix theoretical framework for general screened potentials and develop a numerical method to compute these asymptotic wavefunctions efficiently. Our approach yields short-range scattering phase shifts that remain invariant with respect to the matching point in the asymptotic region. Applying the Debye screening potential as an illustrative example, we calculate elastic and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for H-like ions (He, C, Ne) across varying temperatures and densities. The calculations show that Debye screening systematically modifies resonance structures and progressively lowers excitation thresholds. Nevertheless, the effective collision strengths and rate coefficients exhibit approximate scaling laws. These findings enable convenient access to electron collision data in plasma environments, advancing plasma diagnostics and modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While traditional metagratings focus on channeling energy into higher-order Floquet modes for a fixed incidence angle, we leverage the fundamental mode as a versatile degree of freedom to engineer spatial dispersion over a continuous angular spectrum. By strategically distributing non-uniformly loaded metallic wires and rigorously modeling their mutual interactions through an impedance-matrix formulation, we realize prescribed angular transfer functions with high efficiency. In particular, the framework is validated at 3.5 GHz through full-wave simulations of (i) low-pass, (ii) high-pass, and (iii) all-pass spatial filters. The results demonstrate that fundamental-mode engineering in non-uniform metagratins offers a highly efficient platform for advanced spatial wave manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u5177\u5907\u89d2\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u65e0\u6807\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7535\u78c1\u73af\u5883\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5747\u5300\u591a\u5c42\u4ecb\u8d28\u6805\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u4f53\u52a0\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u96c6\u603b\u7b49\u6548\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u9891\u6bb5\u5185\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u88c5\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u901a\u3001\u9ad8\u901a\u548c\u5168\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5747\u5300\u591a\u5c42\u4ecb\u8d28\u6805\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This change of mathematical type constitutes the core of the 'cut': a structurally necessary interface from group-based kinematics to set-based counting. In the presented view the basis relevant for recorded outcomes is not determined by the system Hamiltonian alone; it is induced by the measurement mapping, i.e., by the detector channel together with the coarse-grained readout that defines an instrument. The probabilistic mapping is anchored in symmetry and measure theory: by Gleason-type uniqueness (Gleason for projections in $d>2$ and Busch's extension for Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) including $d=2$), the trace rule is the unique probability measure consistent with additivity over exclusive events and basis-independence of the unitary sector. A compact qubit--pointer model yields an induced unsharp POVM $E_\\pm=\\tfrac12(\\id\\pm \u03b7\\,\u03c3_z)$ with $\u03b7$ fixed by pointer resolution, displaying explicitly how the detector induces the relevant basis. Finally, nested-observer paradoxes are tightened into a non-composability lemma: joint assignment of outcome propositions is obstructed unless a joint instrument exists.

Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies.

The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\\rm GL}(N,{\\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit.

In the vortex-full sector and in the presence of a time-reversal-breaking three-spin term of strength $\u03ba$, the energy spectrum is gapped and the ground state possesses an even Chern number. An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $\u03b5$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $\u03b5$ in the two limits of small or large $\u03ba$. The analytical approach is confirmed by numerical perturbation theory directly on the lattice. The latter is in excellent agreement with the full numerics on a finite-size system.

In the context of the 3d GLSM/quantum K-theory correspondence, the Schubert line defects are constructed as 1d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to the 3d field theory, and they flow to objects supported on Schubert varieties $X_w \\subseteq X$ in the quantum K-theory. The flavored Witten index of the 1d defect is expected to compute the Chern character of $[\\mathcal{O}_w]$ -- more precisely, it gives us a polynomial representative of the Schubert class in the quantum K-theory ring. We give strong evidence for this claim by showing in examples that the Witten indices of Schubert defects indeed reproduce a recently-defined set of polynomials that represent the Schubert classes in the Whitney presentation, which we call the parabolic Whitney polynomials. Moreover, upon using the quantum ring relations, we can convert these polynomials into seemingly new polynomials in the Toda presentation, which we call the parabolic quantum Grothendieck polynomials. These new polynomials specialize to known polynomials in various limits, including to the quantum Grothendieck polynomials in the case of the complete flag. In the 2d limit, our construction also realizes the Schubert classes $[X_w]$ in the quantum cohomology ring of the partial flag manifold, and the parabolic quantum Grothendieck polynomials then reduce to previously known parabolic quantum Schubert polynomials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e863d N=2\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0GLSM\u4e2d\u7684\u8212\u4f2f\u7279\u7ebf\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u65d7\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u6784\u9020\u3002", "motivation": "\u8212\u4f2f\u7279\u7ebf\u7f3a\u9677\u5728\u91cf\u5b50K\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4e0eGLSM/\u91cf\u5b50K\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc71d N=2\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e3d\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6784\u9020\u8212\u4f2f\u7279\u7ebf\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97Witten\u7d22\u5f15\u3002", "result": "Witten\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a\u8212\u4f2f\u7279\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86K\u7406\u8bba\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u73af\u5173\u7cfb\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50K\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u8212\u4f2f\u7279\u7c7b\u6784\u9020\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Most efforts have focused on topological classifications of physical systems under given symmetries, while the intrinsic topology of the symmetries themselves has received much less attention. Here, we show that, in generic non-interacting spinless crystals, the spacetime inversion symmetry $PT$ naturally carries a real vector-bundle structure whose topology is characterized by Stiefel--Whitney (SW) classes. In contrast to previous work, where SW classes were used to describe the topology of real valence bundles protected by $PT$, we identify SW classes associated to the $PT$ symmetry itself. These symmetry SW classes can endow the \\emph{total} real bundle of a $PT$-symmetric band structure with nontrivial topology, overturning the common assumption that the total bundle is always trivial. As a consequence, valence and conduction bands can exhibit asymmetric SW classes, in sharp contrast to the usual symmetric scenario. We further demonstrate that the symmetry SW classes provide a refined distinction between atomic insulator phases. Our results underscore the importance of treating crystal symmetries as topological objects in their own right, rather than focusing solely on the topology of energy bands.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027PT\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5411\u91cf\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Stiefel-Whitney\u7c7b\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "PT\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6676\u683c\u62d3\u6251\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u91cd\u89c6\u5c06\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption.

This hardware-level decoupling facilitates an efficient synthesis framework based on microwave network theory (MNT) that rigorously accounts for mutual coupling within both bands. Under this framework, the optimal biasing for sub-cells is determined to achieve precise full-space beam synthesis at both frequencies.

We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures.

In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u51fa\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u6001\u51dd\u805a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u6001\u51dd\u805a\u3001\u9ad8\u6e29\u76f8\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cd\u57fa\u6001\u51dd\u805a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u57fa\u6001\u51dd\u805a\u3001\u9ad8\u6e29\u76f8\u53ca\u53cd\u57fa\u6001\u51dd\u805a", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5728\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u53cd\u57fa\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u51dd\u805a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9ad8\u6e29\u76f8\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u663e\u8457"}}

Engineering the photonic environment surrounding quantum emitters can enhance their emission characteristics. However, simultaneously achieving precise control over both excitation enhancement and quantum-yield modulation at the nanoscale remains elusive, highlighting substantial room for advancing the precised engineering of quantum emission. Here, we introduce silicon Mie voids - air-defined cavities that invert the conventional solid-particle geometry - to achieve independent tuning of quantum emission within an individual subwavelength structure, while minimizing optical losses. Full-wave simulations and experiments on both gradient and uniform Mie-void arrays jointly validate this quantitative framework for emission tuning, which disentangles excitation enhancement arising from local field confinement in air and quantum-yield enhancement resulting from strengthened emitter-resonator coupling, while confirming the accelerated radiative decay enabled by the void configuration. Leveraging this flexible mechanism, we realize a bimodal nanophotonic pattern with near-diffraction-limited pixels that encode the EPFL logo in the bright field and the SJTU logo in both dark field and photoluminescence micrographs. These results establish Mie voids as a powerful platform for programmable, high-density multimodal displays and open new avenues for advancing state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u91cf\u6765\u6c42\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff08DMFT\uff09\u81ea\u6d3d\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u5185\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfDMFT\u5728\u9891\u57df\u6216\u865a\u65f6\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u3002", "motivation": "DMFT\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6216\u865a\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65f6\u57df\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06DMFT\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u65b9\u7a0b\u76f4\u63a5\u6c42\u89e3\u4e8e\u5b9e\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9000\u5316\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u548cTrotter\u5316/K\u64de\u503c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fd1\u671f\u5185\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bethe\u683c\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u534a\u6ee1\u54c8\u4f2f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u94fe\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c0f\u6570\u91cf?>\u7684\u73af\u5883\u683c\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u660e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u6742\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed5\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u9891\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3aDMFT\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e24\u7ad9\u70b9DMFT\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u8282\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

However, as these architectures scale toward artificial Kitaev chains with phase-control loops, local accessibility becomes restricted, constraining conventional local parity control and detection. While Andreev molecules offer a platform for non-local intervention, deterministic protocols for parity manipulation have yet to be experimentally established. Here, we demonstrate deterministic non-local control over the parity configuration of a quantum dot (QD) by electrically modulating the coherent hybridization with a spatially adjacent QD within an Andreev molecule. By systematically investigating three distinct joint parity configuration regimes in the elastic co-tunneling limit, we experimentally uncover the operational conditions for this non-local control. In conjunction with theoretical simulations establishing a global phase diagram, we identify a set of universal selection rules governing parity transitions, dictated by the symmetry-imposed interplay between the joint parity configuration and the dominant inter-dot coupling mechanism (elastic co-tunneling vs. crossed Andreev reflection). Furthermore, we establish the supercurrent, directly signaled by zero-bias conductance peaks, as an intrinsic, sensor-free probe of the parity configuration, obviating the need for auxiliary charge sensors.

Using the recently developed generalized perturbative reduction method (GPRM) the SIT equations are reduced to vector (coupled) nonlinear Schrodinger equations for auxiliary functions. This approach demonstrates that, unlike McCall and Hahn SIT theory in which single-component scalar breather can propagate independently, in the more general theory of SIT the second derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinate and time of the wave equation play a significant role and describe the interaction of two scalar SIT breathers forming a coupled pair. This is a vector 0\u03c0pulse of SIT - a two-component vector breather oscillating with the sum and difference of frequencies and wave numbers. The profile, parameters and properties of this pulse differ significantly from the characteristics of the McCall and Hahn pulses.\n  Using GPRM it is shown that besides the scalar soliton and the scalar breather, the vector $0\u03c0$ pulse is also a universal nonlinear wave, arising in virtually all areas of physics where nonlinear phenomena are described by nonlinear equations containing second-order and higher-order derivatives. A number of such nonlinear equations are presented.

MM codes are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes defined from length-t chain complexes with $t \\ge 4$. The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$.

By analyzing the null geodesics, we determine the photon sphere radius and the critical impact parameter, deriving the geometric capture cross section and the classical differential scattering cross section. Utilizing the partial-wave method, we numerically compute the absorption and scattering cross sections across a broad frequency range. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with the low-frequency limit and the high-frequency sinc approximation, as well as with the semiclassical glory approximation. We analyze the dependence of the spectra on the charge and the regularization parameter (Hubble length). Under the horizon-radius normalization, we observe that the total absorption cross section increases with the regularization parameter, a behavior we attribute to the variation of the dimensionless mass. Furthermore, by comparing Frolov, Reissner--Nordstr\u00f6m, and Hayward black holes, we demonstrate that their absorption and scattering patterns are nearly indistinguishable when their critical impact parameters or glory impact parameters are matched. This indicates that the photon sphere geometry predominantly governs scalar field interactions, while the detailed core structure plays a secondary role.

Inspired by the concept of mechanical bits (MBs), this paper presents a self-locking non-volatile coding metasurface platform enabled by Kresling origami-based MBs, where the continuous mechanical deformation of individual meta-atoms is discretized into robust binary geometric states protected by intrinsic energy barriers. The bistable states are strictly mapped to 1-bit EM coding phases via tailored metallic patterns integrated onto a multimaterial 3D printed Kresling origami array.

In addition, the lightweight origami unit (1.5 g) exhibits an exceptional load-bearing capacity, supporting over 100 times its own weight.

There are currently no exact analytical solutions for this scenario. However, by using perturbation theory, where both the Proca mass and the black hole charge are small parameters, it is possible to find an exact analytical solution. In this solution, the metric tensor remains unchanged, but the vector potential deviates from the Coulomb potential. In particular, even if the Proca mass is limited by the value $m_\u03b3<10^{-48}\\text{g}$, which is the current experimental upper limit for photon mass, it makes a significant contribution to the dynamical equations. In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and charged particles in the vicinity of a weakly Proca-charged black hole, and test the observational implications of the solution of the Einstein-Proca equations for gravitational bending, the black hole shadow, and the fit to the orbits of the Galactic center flares observed by the near-infrared GRAVITY instrument. We find that only extremely cold photons, which are likely scattered before reaching a distant observer, could reveal the non-zero photon mass effect through the black hole shadow. For the Galactic center flare analysis we obtained constraints on the dimensionless Proca parameter to $\u03bc\\leq 0.125$ for the electric interaction parameter in the range $-1.1 < \\mathrm{Q} < 0.5$, which can be potentially tested by future GRAVITY flare astrometry.

We lift this correspondence to excited states, and claim that both Cherednik eigenfunctions and BAF's can be combined to produce symmetric functions, which coincide with each other and are eigenfunctions of the both DIM Hamiltonians and power sums of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians at once.

However, direct measurements at the fabrication level provide limited knowledge, whether through destructive cross-section imaging or non-destructive ellipsometry, while complete optical characterization that enables precise dispersion metrology is time-consuming and poorly suited for mass-scale foundry fabrication. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework to solve three complementary problems: (i) predicting resonator geometric dimensions, (ii) identifying the correct material dispersion, and last, but not least, (iii) precisely reconstructing the integrated dispersion spectrum directly from ring dimensions. These three neural networks together enable both inverse and forward characterization of microring resonators. Using numerically generated datasets based on Sellmeier-type material models, we demonstrate <1 nm ring dimension prediction accuracy without noise, <8 nm prediction accuracy with ~45 dispersion samples under a realistic frequency measurement noise level (50 MHz), and ~16 nm prediction accuracy at a higher noise level (200 MHz). The Sellmeier model classification exceeds 99% accuracy in all cases. Importantly, dispersion sampled far from the pump resonances proves most informative, reducing full-spectrum characterization requirements. The forward-prediction network reconstructs dispersion spectra from the ring dimensions with high accuracy.

In large gas lasers, however, the frequency spacing between longitudinal modes of the resonator easily becomes significantly smaller than the Doppler-broadened width of the gain profile. As a consequence, the laser might operate on a multitude of modes simultaneously, or jump between modes. Such unstable operation cannot be tolerated in metrological or sensing applications, such as ring laser gyroscopes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method to establish stable operation on a chosen mode index by optically steering the ring laser to a desired mode index through injection locking with an external laser.

We employ double ionic gating to reach fields past $ 1$ V/nm, for which $\u0394> t_\\perp$. We find that for $\u0394\\simeq t_\\perp$, the evolution of the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) peak as a function of applied gate voltages undergoes a sharp change in slope, exhibiting a pronounced \"knee\". Increasing $\u0394$ past the \"knee\" results in an unusual evolution transport properties: the peak in $R_{xx}$ decreases in magnitude, it exhibits a splitting concomitant with multiple sign reversals of the Hall resistance, and hysteresis in the peak position emerges. We explain the observed phenomenology in terms of in-gap bound states, whose energy strongly depends on the perpendicular electric field, and crosses the mid-gap level for sufficiently large $\u0394> t_\\perp$. The phenomenon causes large changes in the electronic density of in-gap states that profoundly affect the evolution of the chemical potential.

While the identification of a geometric origin for time's arrow is compelling in the case of brane-world models, we point out a possible tension between the proposed volume growth and the observational stability of the effective four-dimensional Newton's gravitational constant, G, that may arise in Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory. In standard KK approaches, such volume growth induces a time-variation of G that exceeds Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) bounds by many orders of magnitude. To resolve this tension while preserving the author's key insight in the Kaluza-Klein case, we propose an extension: the \"shape-dynamic arrow of time\". By utilizing the scale-invariant monotonicity of Perelman's nu-entropy under normalized Ricci flow, we demonstrate how an arrow of time can emerge from the geometric smoothing of extra dimensions at fixed volume, thereby satisfying observational constraints on fundamental constants.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper suggests that the arrow of time in the universe might be linked to the expansion of extra dimensions, but there\u2019s a problem because this would change Newton\u2019s gravitational constant too much, conflicting with observations.

If time\u2019s arrow is related to the expansion of the universe, especially extra dimensions, this could help explain why the universe is the way it is. But there are challenges, like the problem with Newton\u2019s gravitational constant, which needs to be addressed.", "method": "The authors use theoretical analysis in their preprint, considering concepts from extra dimensions in Kaluza-Klein theories, the behavior of geometric quantities like Ricci flow, and entropy measures in geometry.

They introduce the new 'shape-dynamic' concept using Perelman\u2019s nu-entropy as a solution to this problem, which maintains the key idea but adjusts the geometry to keep Newton\u2019s constant in check.", "conclusion": "Even though the author makes a good case for how time\u2019s arrow might work in theories with extra dimensions, the main problem remains the variation in Newton\u2019s constant.

This development provides a clear and systematic route to constructing new configurations with nontrivial Baryonic charge and magnetic field, leveraging the fact that the Einstein--Scalar--Maxwell system is considerably more tractable, thanks to powerful solution-generating techniques. In this work, we exploit the framework that allows compact sources dressed by scalar fields to be consistently embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds, and we construct their dual counterparts carrying Baryonic charge in the Skyrme sector. The resulting Baryonic charge is expressed directly in terms of the parameters characterizing the seed spacetime, and a corresponding quantization condition involving these parameters is explicitly derived.

While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper entails the categoricity of quantum states as Vector Bundles in terms of Entanglement Rank.", "motivation": "Understanding quantum entanglement through global geometric concepts and vector bundle theory.", "method": "Uses Coordinate-free geometry, linear algebraic topology, and categorical constructions to analyze entanglement in gapped systems and symmetry-protected topological states.", "result": " shows that entanglement equivalence classes correspond to vector bundles in ordinary cohomology and in K-theory.", "conclusion": "Compounds of entanglement can be uniquely constructed in such systems, demonstrated in translation-ally invariant spin chains via string-like braiding moves of Wilson lines with intrinsic structure over a very general base manifold."}}

Readout fidelity is typically limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and energy relaxation ($T_1$ decay), a significant problem for superconducting qubits. While most approaches classify results using clustering algorithms on integrated readout signals, these methods cannot distinguish a qubit that was initially in the ground state from one that decayed to it during measurement. We instead propose using machine learning (ML) on the raw, non-integrated analog signal. We apply time-series classification models, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to the full data trajectory. We find that our LSTM model, combined with filtering and feature engineering, consistently outperforms clustering. The largest improvements come from reclassifying points in the boundary regions between clusters. These points correspond to atypical measurement records, likely due to transient or noisy features lost during data integration. By retaining temporal information, sequence-aware models like LSTMs can better discriminate these trajectories, whereas clustering methods based on integrated values are more prone to misclassification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528ML\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u62df\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5224\u522b\u521d\u59cb\u548c\u8870\u51cf\u5230\u57fa\u6001\u7684qubit\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6a21\u62df\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u610f\u8bc6\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u662f\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u6291\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a \"branch selection problem\", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86decoherent histories\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684 decoherence \u4e0b\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u54ea\u4e9b\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u80fd\u591f\u7559\u4e0b\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u7c7b\uff08\u4f2a\uff09\u968f\u673a\u7684 histories \u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e decoherence\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u957f\u671f histories \u4e2d\u7684 decoherence \u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684 histories \u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u91cd\u805a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7eaf\u5ea6\u7684 Petz \u590d\u6742\u6062\u590d\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316 histories\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u79bb\u7fa4\u7684 maverick histories\u3002\u4ece Many Worlds Interpretation \u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5c06\u81ea\u6211\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u89c6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u533a\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u76f8\u5e72\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u5206\u652f\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u201d\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\u5219\u9610\u660e\u4e86 Born's \u6cd5\u5219\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4ee5\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u786e\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d decoherence \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5f55\u7559\u5b58\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9 Many Worlds Interpretation \u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 decoherent histories \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684 decoherence \u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\uff08\u4f2a\uff09\u968f\u673a histories \u5206\u6790\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u957f\u671f histories \u4e2d\u7684 decoherence \u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u91cf\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e decoherence \u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u957f\u671f histories \u4e2d\u7684 decoherence \u7ed3\u6784\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u91cd\u805a\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53d1\u751f\uff1b\u4ece Many Worlds Interpretation \u770b\uff0cself-location \u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u652f\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff1bBohr's \u6cd5\u5219\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u786e\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684 decoherence \u4e0b\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u91cf\u968f decoherence \u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u957f\u671f histories \u4e2d\u7684 decoherence \u7ed3\u6784\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u91cd\u805a\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u4ece Many Worlds Interpretation \u770b\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u6211\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5206\u652f\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9 Bohr's \u6cd5\u5219\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u786e\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

This architecture incorporates an inverse-squeezing operator following the displacement operation of a conventional Kennedy receiver, mapping the S-BPSK signals onto equivalent large-amplitude coherent states. Furthermore, it employs a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector to perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision-making. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under ideal conditions, the IS-Kennedy receiver effectively translates the transmitter's squeezing resources into a displacement gain at the receiver. Consequently, its error probability approaches the Helstrom bound across the entire energy spectrum, remaining within a constant factor of 3 dB. In the low-photon-number regime ($N \\approx 0.6$), the proposed scheme surpasses the coherent-state limit, achieving an error rate below 1\\%. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of system performance under non-ideal conditions, revealing the robustness of PNR detection against background dark counts and a characteristic ``parity photon-number step'' saturation effect arising from squeezing parameter mismatch.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\\langle n_x\\rangle - \\langle n_y\\rangle$.

The diagonal component with respect to the crystal momentum gives a metric corresponding to the variance of the time-evolved position, and its coefficient of the quadratic term in time is the group-velocity variance, signaling ballistic wavepacket dispersion. The other diagonal QGT component with respect to time reveals the energy variance. The off-diagonal QGT component features a real part as a covariance and an imaginary part representing a quench-induced curvature. Using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, our numerical results of different quenches confirm that the post-quench QGT is governed by physical quantities and local geometric objects from the initial state and post-quench bands, such as the Berry connection, group velocities, and energy variance.

In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction.

However, simulating the NLSE on a quantum computer is inherently challenging due to the presence of the nonlinear term. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating the NLSE based on the split-step Fourier method. During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions.

In particular, the $(n, n-1)$-QRACs, which encode $n$ bits of classical information into $n-1$ qubits, provides an ideal theoretical model for verifying quantum advantage in high-dimensional spaces; however, the analytical derivation of optimal codes for general $n$ has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish an analytical construction method for $(n, n-1)$-QRACs by using an explicit operator formalism. We prove that this construction strictly achieves the numerically conjectured upper bound of the average success probability, $\\mathcal{P} = 1/2 + \\sqrt{(n-1)/n}/2$, for all $n$. Furthermore, we present a systematic algorithm to decompose the derived optimal POVM into standard quantum gates. Since the resulting decoding circuit consists solely of interactions between adjacent qubits, it can be implemented with a circuit depth of $O(n)$ even under linear connectivity constraints. Additionally, we analyze the high-dimensional limit and demonstrate that while the non-commutativity of measurements is suppressed, an information-theoretic gap of $O(\\log n)$ from the Holevo bound inevitably arises for symmetric encoding.

A key open question is how long coherence can be extended under this strategy and what fundamental limits constrain it. Here we introduce a fully parameterized, multi-objective periodic-flux modulation framework that simultaneously optimizes energy relaxation $T_1$ and pure dephasing $T_\u03c6$, thereby quantifying the tradeoff between them. For fluxonium qubits with realistic noise spectra, our method enhances $T_\u03c6$ by a factor of 3-5 compared with existing DSS strategies while maintaining $T_1$ in the hundred-microsecond range. We further prove that, although DSSs eliminate first-order sensitivity to low-frequency noise, relaxation rate cannot be reduced arbitrarily close to zero, establishing an upper bound on achievable $T_1$. At the optimized working points, we identify double-DSS regions that are insensitive to both DC and AC flux, providing robust operating bands for experiments. As applications, we design single- and two-qubit control protocols at these operating points and numerically demonstrate high-fidelity gate operations. These results establish a general and useful framework for Pareto-front engineering of DSSs that substantially improves coherence and gate performance in superconducting qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u5468\u671f\u8c03\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728_fluxonium qubits\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4T\u2081\u548c\u7eaf\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4T\u03c6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347T\u03c6 3-5\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301T\u2081\u5728100\u5fae\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u53ccDSS\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u3001\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\uff08DSSs\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4f4e\u9891\u78c1\u573a\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5ef6\u4f38\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u5468\u671f\u8c03\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4T\u2081\u548c\u7eaf\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4T\u03c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u566a\u58f0\u9891\u8c31\u7684fluxonium qubits\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709DSS\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0cT\u03c6\u63d0\u53473-5\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301T\u2081\u5728100\u5fae\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1DSS\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4e00\u9636\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u6e29\u7387\u65e0\u6cd5\u65e0\u9650\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u786e\u5b9aT\u2081\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aDSSs\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While surface codes have been a dominant approach, their limitations have spurred the development of more advanced QEC architectures. These advanced codes often present increased complexity, demanding innovative decoding methodologies. This work investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, including hybrid and multi-agent approaches, to enhance the decoding of various advanced QEC architectures. By leveraging the ability of RL to learn optimal strategies from noisy syndrome measurements, we explore the potential for achieving improved logical error rates and scalability compared to traditional decoding methods. Our approach examines the adaptation of reinforcement learning to exploit the structural properties of these modern QEC models. We also explore the benefits of combining different RL algorithms to address the multifaceted nature of the decoding problem, considering factors such as code degeneracy and real-world noise characteristics.

In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~\u03bc$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We propose such an operation using light-mediated interaction with another system that possesses a nonlinearity equivalent to more than a quadratic potential. Such a potential grants access to a nonlinear operation that can be broadcast to the target linear system. The nonlinear character of the operation can be verified by observing adequate negative values of the target system's Wigner function and the squeezing of the variance of a certain nonlinear combination of the quadratures below the thresholds attainable by Gaussian states.

Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which dominate real quantum devices. We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. On hardware with pronounced spatial quality variation, DynQ achieves up to 19.1 percent higher fidelity and 45.1 percent lower output error. When transient hardware defects cause baseline executions to fail completely, DynQ adapts dynamically and achieves over 86 percent fidelity.

Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/\u03b3\\approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes.

In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \\textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis.

Implementing Violaris' unitary message-transfer primitive, we compare performance across IBM Eagle, Nighthawk, and Heron (r2/r3) processors for message sizes up to $n=32$, without error mitigation. We study three message families -- sparse (one-hot), half-weight, and dense -- and measure conditional string success $p_{\\mathrm{all}}=\\Pr(P=\u03bc\\mid R=0)$, memory erasure after uncomputation, and correlation diagnostics (branch contrast and bitwise mutual information). The sparse family compiles to essentially constant two-qubit depth, yielding a depth-controlled probe of device noise: at $n=32$ we observe $p_{\\mathrm{all}}$ spanning $\\approx0.07$ to $\\approx0.68$ across backends.

We first prove that calculating the optimal code weight is an $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard problem, demonstrating the necessity of establishing bounds for weight that are analytical or efficiently computable. Then we systematically investigate the feasible code parameters with weight constraints. We provide various explicit analytical lower bounds and in particular completely characterize stabilizer codes with weight at most 3, showing that they have distance 2 and code rate at most 1/4. We also develop a powerful linear programming (LP) scheme for setting code parameter bounds with weight constraints, which yields exact optimal weight values for all code parameters with $n\\leq 9$. We further refined this constraint from multiple perspectives by considering the generator weight distribution and overlap.

In their standard formulation, graph states are generated by controlled-$Z$ interactions and naturally encode symmetric exchange properties.

We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states.

This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary \"kick\" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
