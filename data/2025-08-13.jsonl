The spin ladder is described\nby an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange\ninteractions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary\nsituations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In\nthe strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2\nchain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and\nproviding a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that\neffective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM\ninteractions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM\ninteractions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be\nrealized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we\nemploy Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a\nmultitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven\nby both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs\n(chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in\nthe DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in\nthe experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit\ndevice physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum\ndots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing\nquantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations."}

Data-driven ROMs are typically built with a two-step\nstrategy: data compression in a lower-dimensional latent space, and prediction\nof the temporal dynamics on it. To achieve real-time prediction, however, there\nare two challenges to overcome: (i) ROMs of chaotic systems can become\nnumerically unstable; and (ii) sensors' data are sparse, i.e., partial, and\nnoisy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a three-step strategy: (i) a\nconvolutional autoencoder (CAE) compresses the system's state onto a\nlower-dimensional latent space; (ii) a latent ROM (echo state network, ESN),\nwhich is formulated as a state-space model, predicts the temporal evolution on\nthe latent space; and (iii) sequential data assimilation based on the Ensemble\nKalman filter (EnKF) adaptively corrects the latent ROM by assimilating noisy\nand sparse measurements. This provides a numerically stable method\n(DA-CAE-ESN), which corrects itself every time that data becomes available from\nsensors. The DA-CAE-ESN is tested on spatio-temporally chaotic partial\ndifferential equations: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a\ntwo-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (Kolmogorov flow). We show that the\nmethod provides accurate and stable forecasts across different levels of noise,\nsparsity, and sampling rates. As a by-product, the DA-CAE-ESN acts as a\nlocalization strategy that mitigates spurious correlations, which arise when\napplying the EnKF to high-dimensional systems.

The wavefunction of the reaction complex is expanded in an overcomplete\nset of arrangement-dependent Fock-Delves hyperspherical basis functions and the\ninteractions of the reactants and products with electric fields are accounted\nfor in the total angular momentum representation. A significant computational\nchallenge affecting our previously developed approach [Phys. Rev.

Using accurate {\\it ab initio} potential energy\nsurfaces, we calculate total and state-resolved cross sections for the chemical\nreactions LiF$(v=1,j=0)$ + H $\\to$ Li + HF($v'=0,j'$) and F + HD$(v=0,j=0)$\n$\\to$ HF + D, DF + H as functions of collision energy and electric field\nstrength.

A typical solution to\nendogenous security problems is the quantum key distribution (QKD), where\nunconditional security can be achieved thanks to the inherent properties of\nquantum mechanics. Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enjoys\nhigh secret key rate (SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical\ncommunication infrastructure. Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent\nreceivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted\nto the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy\nreceiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of\ncoherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method\nis used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the\nSKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver\nand homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels. We further propose an\nequivalent transmittance method to facilitate the calculation of both the\nbit-error rate (BER) and SKR. Numerical results show that the CD-Kennedy\nreceiver can outperform the homodyne receiver in turbulent channels in terms of\nboth BER and SKR performance. We find that BER and SKR performance advantage of\nCD-Kennedy receiver over homodyne receiver demonstrate opposite trends as the\naverage transmittance increases, which indicates that two separate system\nsettings should be employed for communication and key distribution purposes.\nBesides, we also demonstrate that the SKR performance of a CD-Kennedy receiver\nis much robust than that of a homodyne receiver in turbulent channels."}

Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused\ncircularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular\nmomenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral\ndichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes,\nrevealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM.

In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR)\nwhich generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two\nadvantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts,\nallowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final\nderivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative\nestimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the\nPSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate\n$U(x) = \\exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs\nare valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words.\nAdditionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by\nWierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it\nyields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the\nweighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter\nshifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates."}

The\nsecond type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the\nlocalized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called\neverywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with\nalmost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.\nAfter illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend\nthe analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and\ndouble semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological\norders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them\ncan be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a\ndirectly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem.\nMotivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct\nanyons in the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We\nconfirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC\nand DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly,\nusing the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the\nWilson loops, we further reveal that $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition\nbetween $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path\ntoward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions\nbeyond anyon condensation."}

We\nconsider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are\nsmoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary\nhigh-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and\nwaiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially,\nperforming 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization\nof a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented\nusing static dots.
