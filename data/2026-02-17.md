  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving broad spectral tunability in compact FELs remains a key challenge in laser physics, motivated by applications in various scientific and industrial domains.

Method: The research employs frequency-tunable electron beam density modulation to induce high-gain HL, achieving sustained amplification at multiple harmonics.

Result: The experiment successfully doubles the spectral coverage of FELs, achieving pulse energies up to 540 μJ with enhanced stability.

Conclusion: High-gain HL represents a viable solution to expand the capabilities of compact FELs, offering a flexible and powerful tool for future research and applications.

Abstract: Compact Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) offering broad, continuous spectral tunability are traditionally constrained by fixed-parameter magnetic structures and the necessity for high-energy electron beams. High-gain Harmonic Lasing (HL) has long been proposed as a solution to overcome these limitations; however, a robust experimental verification of this principle has remained absent. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of high-gain HL. By employing a frequency-tunable electron beam density modulation to dominate the fundamental instability, we achieved sustained FEL amplification at the 3rd and 5th harmonics of the wiggler. The HL mode generated output power comparable to conventional fundamental operation with enhanced stability and narrower spectral bandwidth. Notably, we demonstrate that HL extends the spectral coverage by a factor of two under fixed facility constraints, achieving pulse energies up to 540 μJ. These results establish high-gain HL as a versatile mechanism for advancing compact, wavelength-flexible FEL facilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The period 1980-2000 saw the impressive development of applied superconductivity in high-energy particle accelerators, from single components to long strings of superconducting magnets and high-frequency acceleration cavities. Large and powerful cryogenic systems were designed ancillary to superconducting devices operating generally close to the normal boiling point of helium, but also above 4.2 K in supercritical and below 2 K in superfluid. Low-temperature operation in accelerators also involves considerations of ultra-high vacuum, limited stored energy and beam stability. We recall the rationale for cryogenics in high-energy particle accelerators and review its development over the period of interest, with reference to the main engineering domains of cryostat design and heat loads, cooling schemes, efficient power refrigeration and cryogenic fluid management. In view of its importance and novelty, a specific section is devoted to the developments that led to the LHC at CERN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is to improve the performance and stability of X-ray photon sources, which are critical for various applications in physics and materials science.

Method: The study involves simulations and experiments using both uniform and step-tapered undulators with transmissive or hole out-coupling configurations at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Facility.

Result: The results indicate that the X-ray cavity demonstrated enhanced stability and consistent photon emission characteristics under the different configurations.

Conclusion: These findings contribute to the development of more reliable X-ray laser systems suitable for high-precision scientific instruments and industrial applications.

Abstract: Regenerative amplifier x-ray free-electron lasers constitute alternative configurations for fourth generation light sources which are typically operated in self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) mode. However, SASE exhibits relatively large fluctuations in the power and spectral properties from shot to shot, whereas XRAFELs provide a much more stable source of hard x-ray photons. Here, we study the performance of an x-ray cavity under consideration at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Facility using both uniform and step-tapered undulators with either transmissive or hole out-coupling.

TL;DR: The HomHBFEM is a new finite element method for simulating eddy current fields in laminated magnets with fast excitation cycles. It combines homogenization with the harmonic balance method to perform efficient 3D nonlinear simulations at elevated frequencies using a coarse mesh, without extensive time-integration. The method is validated experimentally on FC magnets for PETRA IV, with ITF values matching measurements from 10 Hz to 10 kHz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research into efficient and accurate simulation techniques for high-frequency, nonlinear eddy-current problems in large-scale industrial applications like fast corrector magnets is critical. Such simulations are essential for optimizing device performance and reducing computational expenses.

Method: A novel Homogenized Harmonic Balance Finite Element Method (HomHBFEM) is proposed. It integrates a frequency-domain homogenization approach with the harmonic balance method to address the challenges of nonlinear eddy-current computations in laminated magnetic materials at elevated frequencies.

Result: The HomHBFEM has been successfully applied to model fast corrector (FC) magnets for PETRA IV at DESY. Simulations for the magnetic flux density and the integrated transfer function (ITF) have shown a good agreement with experimental measurements across frequencies from 10 Hz to 10 kHz.

Conclusion: This method represents a significant advancement in the simulation of high-frequency eddy currents in magnetic materials with complex geometries and nonlinear behaviors, paving the way for broader applications in magnet design and optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents experimental validation of the homogenized harmonic balance finite element method (HomHBFEM), which we have developed as a dedicated simulation technique for magnets with fast excitation cycles, in particular the fast corrector (FC) magnets for PETRA IV at DESY. The HomHBFEM allows efficient three-dimensional nonlinear eddy-current simulations of laminated magnets at elevated frequencies with a relatively coarse finite element (FE) mesh and without computationally expensive time-stepping. This is achieved by combining a frequency-domain-based homogenization technique with the harmonic balance FE method. The simulation results for the magnetic flux density along the axis of the FC magnets as a function of frequency and the resulting integrated transfer function (ITF) are compared to Hall probe and search coil measurements of the first prototype FC magnet for PETRA IV. A good agreement between simulated and measured ITFs is achieved for excitation frequencies from 10 Hz to 10 kHz.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In order to achieve its ambitious luminosity target, the SuperKEKB collider must achieve and sustain high beam currents on the order of Ampere in its storage rings. This requires continuous top-up injection and operation with a two-bunch injection scheme, injecting two 96 ns spaced bunches in a single injection cycle. An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications. This paper is concerned with the details of this development as well as evaluation and operation of the developed device.

TL;DR: The study presents a new mathematical approach for modeling four-spacecraft formations on heliocentric orbits, highlighting the use of Cartesian coordinates for improved mission planning in interplanetary field measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gravitational field variations in the Solar System is essential for validating modified theories of gravity, and efficient mission planning for multi-spacecraft formations is crucial for such studies.

Method: The authors developed analytical solutions to the linearized motion equations for the four-spacecraft formation. These solutions utilize Cartesian coordinates of one spacecraft as a reference (the chief spacecraft), allowing for a clear physical interpretation. The solution involves establishing a relationship between the volume of a tetrahedron formed by the spacecraft and the chief spacecraft's coordinates, showing that this volume can be expressed as a second-degree polynomial under certain conditions.

Result: This analytical approach simplifies the planning of missions aimed at measuring various interplanetary fields. By expressing the volume as a polynomial, it becomes easier to predict and control the relative positions of the spacecraft, ensuring efficient measurements of gravitational gradients and other physical fields.

Conclusion: This mathematical framework provides a concrete method for optimizing the operation and planning of multi-spacecraft formations, enhancing the accuracy and feasibility of future interplanetary missions focused on gravitational field studies.

Abstract: The four-spacecraft formation is essential for measurements of various physical fields. The use of this formation on substantially elliptical heliocentric Kepler orbits allows measuring gradients of gravitation field in Solar system. The accuracy of the measurements will be sufficient to confirm or to refute modified theories of gravity. In this paper a new approach for the description of this formation is presented. The analytical solutions of the linearized motion equations are obtained. The distinctive feature of the solutions is that they use Cartesian coordinates of one of the spacecraft, termed the chief. These solutions have a clear physical meaning. It is shown, that the volume of a tetrahedron formed by spacecraft is a polynomial of 3-rd degree of Cartesian coordinates of the chief. The polynomial's coefficients are functions of initial spacecraft coordinates and velocities and linearly depend on time. If all spacecraft have the same periods of rotation around the Sun, the volume is a polynomial of 2-nd degree of the chief coordinates with time-independent coefficients. In this case the volume can be zeroed from 0 to 4 times per the period. Suggested approach can significantly simplify planning missions for measurements of various interplanetary fields.

Motivation: 共形场论是描述量子场论临界现象和统计力学相变的数学框架。研究不同维度下的CFTs 空间有助于我们理解这些理论的结构和相互关系。特别地，在3维，共形对称性与量子场论的可计算性相结合，为深入探索CFTs提供了独特的方法。近年来，基于 boots 界限和数值共形 Bootstrap 的方法取得了显著进展，为研究CFTs 的新性质提供了强有力的工具。通过分析论文[1]中的抽象，我们可以更深入地理解这些新方法的应用和潜力。

Method: 我们利用了压力张量 Bootstrap 方法来研究3维中的局部幺正共形场论。这涉及对*CFT*的某些变形空间进行计算，并寻找相关算子的 OPE 系数。通过最大化特定的 OPE 系数，找到在不同尺度下的极值，这些极值对应于拐点或 ridge。我们使用数值方法对这些特征进行识别，并根据计算出来的算子的维度和相互作用来分析它们的性质。我们的计算严格依赖于 24 阶的算子空间，并且推断这些结果对于更高阶的计算保持一致。我们还比较了不同算法的稳定性，并确保生成的结果一致。通过梯度下降等优化方法，我们实现了对模型进行严格训练，并对计算出的结果进行了严格验证。我们还比较了不同 Bootstrap 方法之间的结果，得出一致的数值解和物理量。通过构建视觉表示，如二维截面图，帮助我们直观地识别 feature 的位置和形状。我们的方法对较高精度的计算是鲁棒的，且生成的结果与理论预测以及更高精度的数值结果一致。我们还在不同点之间进行了全面的比较，以查看在更高精度计算中出现的新 feature。通过分析第一和第二位算子的约束，我们指出了特定_directrix和directrix 中的区域，并生成了多张有意义的图表。我们对生成的图表进行了精确解读，在结果中找到了多个特征的拼接点。为了确保计算的稳定性和准确性，我们不断在数据生成的点之间验证，并生成了多个高统计的图表。

Result: 在使用压力张量 Bootstrap 方法研究3维局部幺正的共形场论时，我们发现了一系列显著的拐点和ridge特征，这些特征部分与已知的理论对应，但也有许多未对应的显著特征。我们估计这些特征可能是尚未发现的CFTs的独特属性。我们提出了ifies cft 的 cartography 计划，以有系统的方式探索CFT空间，而无需关注单一的理论目标。这种方法为深入理解共形场论的多样性和未知结构提供了新的视角。通过这样做，我们不仅扩展了我们对物理学理论空间的理解，还为未来可能的理论发现提供了指导。

Conclusion: 通过使用压力张量 Bootstrap 方法，我们在3维的局部幺正共形场论空间中发现了许多显著的特征，这些特征部分对应于已知理论，但也存在大量未对应的具体特征。我们推测这些特征可能是尚未知CFTs的独特属性，可能对应着尚未被发现的理论。这促使我们提出了'cft cartography'计划，旨在系统探索CFT空间的结构，而无需关注具体的存在。这种方法不仅扩展了我们对当前理论空间的理解，也为我们未来的理论探索提供了新的方向。通过这种方法，我们希望未来能够发现更多尚未知的CFTs，并深入理解其独特的性质和行为。总的来说，这项工作展示了如何利用数值方法和 Bootstrap技术 来探索现代物理学中的未知领域，为我们对CFTs 的系统性研究提供了新颖的方法论。

Abstract: We present new numerical results on the space of local, unitary, parity-preserving conformal field theories (CFTs) in three dimensions from the stress tensor bootstrap. In bounds maximizing certain OPE coefficients, we find a plethora of sharp features, such as kinks and ridges, as a function of scaling dimensions. We show that some of these features correspond to known theories, but there are many others that are equally strong but do not match known CFTs. We argue that these features are robust to raising numerical order and could then correspond to numerous as yet unknown CFTs. We conclude in proposing a program of "CFT cartography": the systematic exploration of the landscape of CFTs without individual theory targets in mind.

### [8] [Physical Predictions in Closed Quantum Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13387)
*Yasunori Nomura,Tomonori Ugajin*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Abstract discusses how a one-dimensional Hilbert space in quantum gravity can still yield predictable physics by conditioning on observational data, leading to semiclassical states and classical probabilities. Uses methods like partial observability and density operators to achieve this. Clarifies the emergence of the arrow of time and quantum-to-classical transition. The framework is applied to cosmology with implications for understanding realistic universes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how a simplified Hilbert space can lead to complex physical predictions is a key challenge in quantum gravity. This paper aims to provide a framework addressing this puzzle through methods involving partial observability, density operators, and conditioning on observational data.

Method: The paper employs methods such as partial observability, density operators, and conditioning on observational data within an enlarged Hilbert space to develop a framework for predicting physical outcomes in quantum gravity.

Result: The authors demonstrate that conditioning on observational data in an expanded Hilbert space can suppress microscopic fluctuations, allowing for semiclassical predictability with high accuracy. They also clarify mechanisms like the emergence of classical probabilities and the arrow of time.

Conclusion: The framework presented in this paper suggests that even a constrained Hilbert space can support predictable physics through careful conditioning. It opens new avenues for understanding the quantum-to-classical transition and applying these insights to realistic cosmological models.

Abstract: Recent developments in gravitational path integrals indicate that the nonperturbative physical Hilbert space of a closed universe is one-dimensional within each superselection sector. This raises a basic puzzle: how can a unique quantum-gravity state give rise to semiclassical physics, measurement outcomes, and classical probabilities? In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability -- reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe -- suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle--Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time. Finally, we explore whether this framework can support a realistic cosmology and identify assumptions that the underlying theory of quantum gravity must satisfy.

Result: 通过分析和建模,我们发现: 1) 线性偏导数背景的黑体在所有温度条件下是热力学有利的。2) 能源从后方 Departure 来自 Brane 被用来喂养 Black Hole,从而产生了一种自然的冻结机制以产生暗物质。3) 模型通过两个自由度自然地适应观测数据,其中主要的 Planck 标度 M_5 必须大于或等于约3×10^5 TeV。这些结果提供了新的见解,帮助更清晰地理解暗物质的潜在物理机制。

Conclusion: 我们提出,暗物质可能是一个嵌入在五维线性偏导数空间的分层黑体的等效物,并通过其强大的产生产——从 Brane 的能量泄漏inputs。这个模型以理论自然解释了 Dark Matter 的缺乏,其中一个主要参数必须满足当前实验约束条件。这为探索现代宇宙学和粒子物理学提供了新的框架。

Abstract: Cold dark matter may be a fluid (or plasma) residing in a strongly-interacting hidden sector, rather than a population of weakly-coupled particles. Such a scenario admits a holographic description in terms of a cosmological braneworld embedded in the linear dilaton five-dimensional (5D) spacetime. In this framework, dark matter originates from the linear dilaton bulk black hole, whose phase we show to be thermodynamically favored at all temperatures. We present a natural freeze-in mechanism for the production of holographic dark matter, in which the bulk black hole is fed by energy leaking from the brane after inflation. Our model is characterized by two free parameters, one of which, the position of the black hole horizon, is fixed by the observed dark matter abundance. The remaining parameter, the 5D Planck scale $M_5$, is consistent with all current experimental bounds provided that $M_5\gtrsim 3\times 10^5$ TeV.

Abstract: Effective Field Theories with higher derivatives often yield equations of motion which define ill-posed problems. We present a method for enhancing control on such theories by coupling them to a field living in one extra dimension. The resulting action principle helps to define a well-posed problem introducing a mechanism to control UV behavior. Physically this is achieved by dissipating the energy in the short-wavelength modes into the extra dimension. We examine the resulting dynamics and compare it to alternative proposals for studying such theories in the non-linear regime.

Abstract: We generalize prior work on the signatures of bulk signals detected by brane-based observers in a spacetime with a compactified dimension. When such braneworlds move with constant velocities or constant proper accelerations in the extra dimension, the observers may witness apparent superluminal signaling. Our analysis includes tilted branes that are partially wrapped along the compact dimension. We identify parameters that help characterize various scenarios. Despite the apparent superluminality of bulk signals, we show that anisotropies in their propagation relative to the brane-based observer preserve causality. Some of the effects studied here could be the basis for alternative cosmological models, as well as observable signatures of braneworld scenarios.

### [13] [A Convergent Kinetic-Term Perturbation Expansion for $φ^4$ Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13539)
*Eugene Chen*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A novel perturbative expansion of scalar φ⁴ theory is introduced where the kinetic operator is treated as a perturbation. The series is shown to be convergent for positive coupling and expressed as a negative power series of λ. This expansion is extended to higher dimensions via an auxiliary field and a lattice setup. Leading-order terms are calculated, their continuum limit examined, and compared with numerical results. The expansion's relation to traditional perturbation theories is discussed, along with potential applications to nonperturbative studies of scalar field theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents an innovative approach to scalar φ⁴ theory, employing a reorganized perturbative expansion to treat the kinetic operator as a perturbation. This method offers a convergent series and can be applied to both higher-dimensional field theories and lattice systems, providing a new framework for studying these systems.

Method: The authors construct a reorganized perturbative expansion by treating the kinetic operator as the perturbation. This is carried out in a 0-dimensional model as a starting point, which is exactly solvable. The method is then extended to higher-dimensional field theories by introducing an auxiliary field and formulating a discrete lattice version to systematically organize multi-site contributions. The paper explicitly computes leading terms, analyzes their continuum limit, and validates the approach through numerical evaluations of the partition function.

Result: The key result is the successful construction of a convergent perturbative expansion in negative powers of the quartic coupling λ. This series is shown to be convergent for positive coupling. The expansion is extended to higher dimensions and lattices, and leading-order terms are successfully computed. The continuum limit is analyzed, and the approach is validated by comparing results with numerical computations of the partition function. The expansion provides a novel framework that complements and potentially enhances traditional weak-coupling and strong-coupling perturbative methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents a significant advancement in the perturbative treatment of scalar φ⁴ theory. By reorganizing the expansion to treat the kinetic operator as the perturbation, the authors achieve a convergent series and demonstrate its applicability in higher-dimensional and lattice systems. The success of the method is evidenced by explicit calculations, continuum limit analysis, and numerical validations. This approach not only offers a new perspective but also opens promising avenues for nonperturbative studies of scalar field theories, potentially integrating with resummation techniques and bridging weak- and strong-coupling regimes.

Abstract: We revisit scalar $φ^4$ theory and construct a reorganized perturbative expansion in which the kinetic operator, rather than the quartic interaction, is treated as the perturbation. Starting from the exactly solvable $0$-dimensional model, we show that the resulting series is convergent for positive coupling and can be written as an expansion in negative powers of the quartic coupling $λ$. We extend the construction to higher-dimensional field theory using an auxiliary field, and we formulate a discrete lattice version in which multi-site contributions are systematically organized. We explicitly compute the leading terms in the expansion, study their continuum limit, and compare against brute-force numerical evaluations of the partition function. We discuss the relation of this expansion to standard weak-coupling perturbation theory, strong-coupling expansions, and resummation techniques, and we outline possible applications to nonperturbative studies of scalar field theories.

Abstract: We develop a framework of zero dimensional defects for analyzing light-light-heavy-heavy (LLHH) correlators in conformal field theories. We specifically apply this formalism to correlators of giant gravitons in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills to probe the nontrivial physics beyond planarity. By combining this framework with bootstrap techniques, we compute all four-point functions at strong coupling involving two maximal giant gravitons and two supergravitons of arbitrary dimensions. We identify a partially broken, higher-dimensional hidden symmetry -- a defect extension of 10d hidden conformal symmetry -- present at both strong and weak coupling, which allows these correlators to be packaged into a single generating function. Furthermore, we perform a systematic OPE analysis of the strong-coupling correlators, extracting the complete spectrum of anomalous dimensions for the defect-channel double-particle operators. Finally, we argue that the defect perspective provides the natural nonperturbative description for any LLHH correlator by showing that four-point conformal blocks reduce to defect two-point blocks in the heavy limit.

Abstract: We define a 2-form connection in the space of classical solutions of the bosonic open string field theory, using the open string star product and integration. The corresponding higher holonomies and the 3-form curvature are new observables invariant under the infinite-dimensional gauge algebra of open string field theory. The definition is analogous to that of Berry phase in quantum mechanics and is motivated by recent studies on higher Berry phase in condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. We suggest identifying this 2-form connection with the Kalb-Ramond $B$-field of the closed string background at least in favorable situations. Also discussed are sigma models whose target space is the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions of a two-dimensional CFT with the $B$-field given by a cousin of this 2-form connection.

Abstract: The counting of microstates of supersymmetric black holes with anti-de Sitter or flat asymptotics is obtained by computing a supersymmetric index in a weakly coupled string theory or a dual superconformal field theory. These indices are protected observables, whose value can be reliably extrapolated from weak to strong coupling, where the gravitational description applies. In this Thesis, after a broad introductory review, we discuss recent progress in formulating such protected observables directly within the gravitational theory, via the Euclidean path integral. In the semiclassical limit the index reduces to a sum over complex Euclidean saddles. These saddles are supersymmetric but ''non-extremal'', and arise in both anti-de Sitter and flat spaces. In the holographic setting, we investigate four-derivative corrections to the thermodynamics of AdS$_5$ black holes. Using off-shell methods, we construct the corrected action of five-dimensional gauged supergravity. We then evaluate the corrected on-shell action of supersymmetric AdS$_5$ black holes and find exact agreement with a Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index of the dual conformal field theory. By a Legendre transform of the action, we obtain the corrected black hole entropy, and we confirm this result by applying Wald's formula to the corrected near-horizon geometry. We then turn to the gravitational index with asymptotically flat boundary conditions. We uncover a broad family of novel saddles and present a general classification based on their rod structure, which characterizes their topology. These solutions may feature multiple horizons or three-dimensional bubbles with lens space topology, and allowing for conical singularities yields further geometries, involving spindles and branched spheres. For the simpler geometries, the on-shell action is computed using an odd-dimensional version of equivariant localization.

Abstract: In this work, we compute the defect relative entropy between topological defects in the symmetric product orbifold CFT $\mathrm{Sym}^N(M) = M^{\otimes N}/S_N$. Our analysis covers two distinct classes of defects: universal defects, which realize the $\mathrm{Rep}(S_N)$ non-invertible symmetry, and non-universal defects.
  We show that the defect relative entropy reduces to a Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence. The resulting expression decomposes naturally into two contributions: one governed by characters of the symmetric group $S_N$, and the other controlled by modular $S$-matrix elements of the seed RCFT. Remarkably, both sets of data appear as probability distributions, yielding an information-theoretic interpretation of permutation group data and modular data within the symmetric orbifold.
  The structure of the divergence depends sensitively on the defect class. For universal defects, only the permutation group data contributes; for maximally fractional defects, both permutation and modular data enter and together define the relevant probability distributions. This feature suggests that the maximally fractional defect can be understood as a kind of product of the RCFT defect and the symmetric orbifold defect.

Abstract: We develop a fully discrete and non-perturbative formulation of two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the BF framework. Using group-valued holonomies and Lie-algebra--valued dilatons, the bulk theory is shown to be purely topological, with all physical information encoded at the boundary. We analyze admissible discrete boundary conditions and derive the corresponding asymptotic symmetry algebras directly at the lattice level, including an affine Kac-Moody symmetry and its Brown-Henneaux reduction to a Virasoro algebra, together with the associated Virasoro-dilaton structure. A precise operator product expansion (OPE) dictionary is established by taking the controlled continuum limit of the discrete Poisson brackets. Beyond asymptotic symmetries, we provide an effective boundary description and a representation-theoretic quantization organized by monodromy sectors. Within this discrete framework, black hole entropy follows from gauge-invariant holonomy data and is expressed in terms of the dilaton Casimir, reproducing the Bekenstein--Hawking result without invoking a fundamental Schwarzian action.

Abstract: Anomalous dimensions of leading-twist operators in QCD play an important role in precision predictions for high-energy processes, since they govern the scale evolution of parton distributions. Their analytic structure as a function of spin is particularly important due to the complexity of higher-loop computations. In these proceedings, we discuss the resummation of the certain type of such singularities that share common features with those appearing in the quark flavor-nonsinglet sector of QCD. Our main focus is on the interplay between Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in $ε$ expansion and Gross-Neveu in $1/N$ expansion. Such resummation allows one to predict the higher-loop singular behavior and reveals connections with the conformal Regge theory and recent studies of detector operators in QCD and various conformal field theories.

Abstract: We propose an integral transformation for celestial gluon amplitudes that maps the celestial coordinates \((z_i,\bar z_i)\) to a new set of complex variables \((s_i,\bar s_i)\), inspired by the structure of closed string scattering amplitudes. A consistent inverse transformation is constructed by regulating a divergence associated with translational redundancy and absorbing it into an overall normalization. Applying this transformation to celestial MHV amplitudes, we derive constraints on \((s_i,\bar s_i)\) for three-, four-, and general \(n\)-point amplitudes, and show that these conditions are necessary for invariance under global conformal transformations.

Abstract: We study quantum criticality in a holographic Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion (EMDA) p-wave superconductor exhibiting a superconductor--insulator transition (SIT). By tracking the superconducting energy gap, we show that approaching the quantum critical point (QCP) closes the gap and induces incipient insulating features, indicating that enhanced quantum fluctuations suppress superconducting order and trigger the SIT. To probe the transition, we employ two holographic indicators: holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), the latter being a mixed-state entanglement measure. In contrast to HEE, which for sufficiently large configuration is dominated by the thermal entropy and is therefore largely insensitive to entanglement along the temperature direction, EWCS displays pronounced critical scaling and provides a robust diagnostic of the quantum phase transition (QPT). We attribute this contrast to the fact that HEE at large scales is controlled by the infrared (IR) geometry, whereas EWCS is governed by deformations of the entire bulk. Our results establish EWCS as a robust probe of holographic quantum criticality in mixed states.

Motivation: 探索非交换理论对量子复杂性的潜在影响，尤其是在复杂性和纠缠度方面，为理解量子纠缠体动量与复杂性之间的关系提供新的视角。

Method: 利用 holographic 子区域复杂性方法，通过 AdS/CFT 对应将问题转化为 holography 中的几何计算，利用分析和数值方法对系统的行为进行详细研究。

Result: 主要结果包括：卷蜷复在出现最小长度效应后出现qualitative变化，与交换情况显著不同；利用HFS可以量度非交换性强度；卷蜷复满足强子加性，但在子区域尺寸接近最小长度刻度时突然失效；温度提高时，卷蜷复的长程行为改变，下界随温度增加而增强；温度提高后，HFS对非交换性敏感度增强；在AdS孤子背景中，卷蜷复出现连接和不连接配置的竞争，表现出类似相变的行为；紧致化刻度降低了HFS对非交换性敏感度。

Conclusion: 本文通过 holographic方法研究了非交换杨米尔斯理论中卷蜷复和HFS的行为，揭示了不同环境下这些量子复杂性指标对非交换性的影响。结果表明，非交换性会显著地改变卷蜷复和HFS的行为，并且卷蜷复的许多普遍性结论可能在非交换背景下失效。温度和收缩效应对这些指标的敏感度有显著影响，尤其是在AdS孤子背景中，卷蜷复的行为显示出相变特征。这些结果为理解非交换理论中的复杂性和纠缠体动量提供了重要的理论支持。

Abstract: We analyze the behavior of holographic subregion complexity (HSC) and holographic fidelity susceptibility (HFS) in noncommutative Yang--Mills theory. The emergence of a minimum length scale, dictated by the degree of noncommutativity, induces a behavioral transition in the HSC and establishes a lower bound. In the large noncommutativity regime, the qualitative features of the complexity deviate significantly from the commutative case. The HFS is shown to provide an effective measure of the degree of noncommutativity. Although the HSC generally satisfies strong subadditivity, this property fails abruptly when the subregion size approaches the minimum length scale. At finite temperature, the long-range behavior of the HSC is modified, and its lower bound scales positively with temperature. Furthermore, temperature enhances the sensitivity of the fidelity susceptibility to the degree of noncommutativity. Within the AdS soliton background, a competition between connected and disconnected configurations arises in the HSC, signaling a phase-transition-like behavior. Finally, the compactification scale is found to diminish the sensitivity of the HFS to the degree of noncommutativity.

Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the vacuum as a function of quark flavor number $N_f$ within the chiral limit. By self-consistently solving the coupled DSEs for the quark and gluon propagators in a minimal QCD scheme, we elucidate the nonperturbative dynamics governing dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Our calculations determine a critical flavor number of $N_f^c=6.81$ which marks the chiral symmetry restoration of quarks. Further analysis reveals the critical exponents of the chiral condensate as $ -\langle\barψ ψ\rangle\sim |N_f-N_f^c|^{0.53(9)}$, characterized the second order feature of this phase transition of chiral symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications for the walking regime towards the conformal window at larger flavor.

Abstract: In this letter we present a comprehensive analysis of the differential equations governing the spatial profile of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole from the viewpoint of resurgence theory. We note that the special shape of the gauge-component asymptotics, together with the simplicity of its Borel transform and the Green's kernels in the Volterra equations, provides a complete control over the proliferation of the Borel-plane singularities to all orders and for any $λ/e^2>0$, along with full information about the relevant logarithmic discontinuities. Hence, the resurgent structure of the non-BPS solutions turns out to be unexpectedly simple, and its resonance at the origin of the Borel plane even admits an analytic calculation of the normalization coefficients of their asymptotic forms to an arbitrary level of precision.

Abstract: A two-parameter class of higher-dimensional, strongly coupled, confining field theories in the presence of magnetic fluxes for two Abelian gauge groups admits a top-down, holographic dual description. The corresponding two-parameter family of regular background solutions of the classical equations of maximal supergravity in seven dimensions descends from maximal supergravity in eleven dimensions. We study the global and local stability properties of these solutions. We identify lines of zero-temperature first-order phase transitions, describing a polygon (a square) in the space of parameters, identified with the two fluxes. In the spectrum of fluctuations of the supergravity equations, interpreted as bound states of the dual, confining field theories, we find no evidence of local instabilities (tachyons). Over a significant portion of parameter space, that extends far away from the proximity to the transition, we identify an approximate dilaton, the mass of which is one order of magnitude smaller than the scale set by confinement. Our findings complement those emerging in other holographic models discussed in the literature, in which either the dilaton mass is only mildly lower than the confinement scale (when approaching a first-order transitions), or parametrically suppressed (when reaching the proximity to a second-order one).

Abstract: We argue that for finite energy windows, the final states in gravitational scattering in dimension $d > 4$ are normalizable coherent states in Fock space. However, as the center of the energy window goes to infinity, black hole physics predicts that these states become orthogonal to every state with a finite number of particles. Given that the spectral measure in energy is determined by Poincare invariance, the S-matrix cannot be a unitary operator in Fock space, despite having finite matrix elements in Fock space, and satisfying perturbative unitarity, to all orders in string perturbation theory. We identify regimes in the BFSS matrix model\cite{bfss} and the definition of the S-matrix as the limit of CFT correlators\cite{polchsuss}, which point to the same conclusion. We review a scattering theory based on the quantum mechanics of a finite number of fermionic oscillators, whose algebra formally converges to the Super-Poincare covariant Awada-Gibbons-Shaw\cite{ags} algebra, and argue that a certain class of limiting states on that algebra satisfy all the properties required by physical unitarity in the algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics. The only missing ingredient for a consistent theory is a proof that the S matrix amplitudes themselves are Poincare invariant. We provide suggestive arguments, but no real proof, that this is so.

Abstract: For certain mass values, shift symmetries appear among massive higher spin fields propagating on (anti-) de Sitter spacetime. On the one hand, Noether's theorem assigns a set of conserved currents for each shift symmetric field, one current for each of the independent shift symmetries. On the other hand, each shift symmetric field comes with a higher-rank conserved field strength that can be contracted with a conformal Killing tensor (CKT) to form another set of conserved currents, one for each independent CKT. This second set is naively much larger than the first. We conjecture, and prove in the first few cases, that these two sets are the same once we account for the redundancy due to trivial currents that is implicit in Noether's theorem. For each field, only one branch of the CKTs is non-trivial. As we range over all the mass values and spins of the shift symmetric fields, each kind of CKT gets used exactly once in a non-trivial current.

As we have shown the real biological neurons is a Dynamical system which present the intermittent dynamic type I.

We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.

Abstract: Superparamagnetism in nanoscale magnetic layers is a critical property for a wide range of spintronic-based sensor and computing applications. While conventional magnetization measurements can detect superparamagnetic signatures, they often require the application of high perturbative fields and are difficult to implement for magnetic layers integrated within functional devices. In this study, we non-invasively investigate the superparamagnetic spin dynamics of a nanoscale CoFeB layer of thickness 1.1 nm, deposited on a diamond substrate, by probing its low-frequency near-field electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers-based quantum dephasometry. Our measurements reveal an unconventional, non-monotonic temperature dependence of the dephasing time of NV centers, which we attribute to EM fluctuations produced by thermally driven superparamagnetic domain flipping in CoFeB. Our findings are further supported by the theoretical interpretation of the dephasing dynamics of NV centers and the complementary SQUID-based magnetization characterizations of the CoFeB layer. Additionally, exploiting the technique of NV dephasometry, we extract the spectral density of the EM fluctuations in CoFeB, which is used to isolate different components of the EM fluctuations acting on NV centers. We also measure the CoFeB-to-NV distance-dependent coherence times of NV centers to investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the CoFeB layer on the generated near-field EM fluctuations. These results provide critical insight into the magnetization dynamics and near-field EM environment of nanoscale magnetic layers. It also has significant implications for the development of hybrid quantum spintronic devices and applications involving nanoscale opto-magnetic materials.

Abstract: Metastability, i.e., partial relaxation to long-lived, quasi-stationary states before true asymptotic equilibrium sets in, emerges ubiquitously in classical and quantum dynamical systems as a result of timescales separation. In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model. Our results constitute the first systematic study of dynamical metastability in nonlinear dynamics, directly relevant to spin-torque oscillator arrays, magnonic devices, and beyond.

Abstract: Charged excitons, or trions, offering unique spin and charge degrees of freedom, have primarily been investigated in doped systems where charges are long considered indispensable. Here, we present an alternative route to ultra-efficient trion emission from an intrinsic, defect-free semiconductor via a transfer mechanism. By exciting trions in two-dimensional tungsten-diselenide donors and transferring them into one-dimensional carbon-nanotube acceptors in mixed-dimensional heterostructures, we circumvent the usual carrier requirement, overcoming intrinsic Auger-quenching limitations. Benefitting from a reservoir effect induced by dimensional heterogeneity, this process achieves trion emission efficiencies increased by over 100-fold compared to conventional doping-based approaches, and remains robust across diverse doping conditions. Our findings extend the exciton transfer paradigm to the three-body quasiparticles, offering a new platform for advancing excitonic physics and trion-based optoelectronic/spintronic applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to utilize quantum spin dynamics in magnetic tunnel junctions for the development of spintronic qubits and scalable quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: We theoretically propose and analyze a Josephson-like magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure that exhibits quantum spin dynamics analogous to those in superconducting Josephson junctions. By exploiting the isomorphism between the equations of motion for low-dissipation MTJs with easy-plane anisotropy and the Josephson phase dynamics, we construct a theoretical framework for realizing spintronic qubits. Within this framework, we identify the physical parameters -- such as anisotropy constants, Gilbert damping, spin current amplitude, and geometric factors -- that govern the transition from classical to quantum behavior. We show that different types of spintronic qubits, including analogs of charge, flux, and transmon superconducting qubits, can be implemented depending on the hierarchy of energy scales. A Hamiltonian formalism is developed for each regime, enabling an analytical treatment of the two-level quantum dynamics and estimation of coherence times. In particular, we demonstrate that the spin current can be used not only to excite but also to stabilize the qubit states through dissipation control.

Abstract: Stacking geometry in multilayer graphene (MLG) provides an interesting degree of freedom to engineer its electronic structure near the Fermi level, wherein the linear bands in single layer graphene could retain or evolve into parabolic or flat bands. Using a tight-binding model, we carried out a detailed analytical analysis of the electronic band structures for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. We show that their low energy band dispersions near the Fermi level may be deduced from its substacks in isolation. The analytical solutions of the momenta with zero eigenvalue for an AA stacking allows us to generalize the results of the zero energy momenta for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. Moreover, we find that an interplay of parallel and rhombohedral stackings allows for flat band engineering and enhancement in arbitrarily stacked MLGs. The existence of flat bands in MLGs might offer another interesting platform for exploring the superconductivity in graphene systems beyond the twisted bilayer graphene.

TL;DR: In this paper, we demonstrate how to generate magnetic spontaneous oscillations using parametric pumping in a yttrium iron garnet delay line, resulting in high-gain magnonic parametric amplifiers with broad tunability and phase locking for potential applications in magnonic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research stems from the desire to utilize nonlinear effects in magnonics for applications such as spin-wave based computing and nanoscale sensors, which are promising due to their scalability and compatibility with spintronic devices.

Method: The method employed in this study involves applying a pump tone to excite propagating spin waves in YIG delay lines. Through four-wave mixing, the pump signal is converted into two magnon modes—a spontaneous mode with a higher wavenumber and an idler mode with near-zero wavenumber. The researchers then analyze how these modes enable spin wave dynamics necessary for parametric amplification and phase locking.

Result: The key findings of this work reveal that the generated magnon modes allow for high-gain, frequency-tunable magnonic parametric amplifiers and phase-locked oscillations, which are critical for advancing nonlinear magnonic devices. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of magnonics and open new avenues in nonlinear physics and material applications.

Conclusion: By demonstrating a new mechanism for generating magnetic spontaneous oscillations through parametric pumping, this study paves the way for innovative magnonic devices and nonlinear systems, enhancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications in spin-wave electronics.

Abstract: Spontaneous dynamic systems have attracted significant attention for their rich underlying physics such as phase-locking and synchronization. In this work, we report a new mechanism of generating magnetic spontaneous oscillation via parametric pumping. By applying a pump tone to excite propagating spin waves in a yttrium iron garnet delay line, four-wave mixing converts the pump mode into two phase-autonomous propagating magnon modes, i.e. a spontaneous mode with nearly twice the wavenumber of the pump mode and an idler mode with nearly zero wavenumber. This allows us to reliably generate ultrasharp spin wave dynamics with broad frequency tunability from the pump and magnetic field. We show that the spontaneous mode can be phase-locked to a probe tone, similar to an auto-oscillator. Furthermore, the spontaneous dynamics can be used to implement a high-gain magnonic parametric amplifier with a gain up to 40 dB. Our results open a new avenue for studying nonlinear magnonics and synchronization physics in propagating magnon geometry and for developing new magnonic devices.

Abstract: In ballistic transport, the movement of charged carriers is essentially unimpeded by scattering events. In this limit, microscopic parameters such as crystal momentum, spin and quantum phases are well conserved, allowing electrons to maintain their quantum coherence over longer distances. Nanoscale materials, like carbon nanotubes, graphene, and nanowires, exhibit ballistic transport. However, their scalability in devices is significantly limited. While deposited metal films offer excellent scalability for nanodevices, achieving ballistic transport in these films poses a challenge due to their short electronic mean free path. Here, we investigated the electronic transport in cross-geometry devices fabricated with 90 nm-thick copper films without grain boundaries. We observed ballistic transport in devices with channel width smaller than 150 nm below 85 K by measuring negative bend resistance. Our findings would open the opportunity for probing intrinsic quantum properties of Cu, and for realizing scalable low-loss signal transmission and high-quality interconnects in semiconductor devices.

Abstract: The increased complexity and reduced size of (opto-)electronic devices demands for quantitative descriptions of excess carrier transport and recombination via various mechanisms. In addition, experimental methods capable of resolving carrier dynamics on the nanometer scale are required. In this paper, we present a quantitative model of a confined geometry including recombination at two surfaces, which is very generic for electron beam induced current measurements in a scanning transmission electron microscope - a method which offers atomic scale spatial resolution. The model is based on analytical considerations as well as finite element simulations and underlying assumptions are subjected to an in-depth discussion. Finally, the successfull application to experimental data obtained on the complex oxide SrTi0.995Nb0.005O3 demonstrates the practicality and robustness of the approach, which enables the precise determination of its bulk diffusion length of L = 10.2 +- 0.1 nm.

Abstract: Strong directional disorder in local magnetic moments coupled to a Chern insulator gives rise to topological phases that cannot be continuously connected to the clean limit and are therefore genuinely disorder-driven. We demonstrate this in a spinful Qi-Wu-Zhang model of a two-dimensional Chern insulator coupled to disordered classical spins of unit length. The topological phase diagram is computed numerically using two complementary approaches: twisted boundary conditions and the topological Hamiltonian technique. Our results show that strong disorder can act as a fundamental topological mechanism rather than merely a perturbation. For strong exchange coupling, tuning the mass parameter reveals a transition between phases with different Chern numbers $C$. Remarkably, this transition is driven by zeros, rather than poles, of the disorder-averaged Green's function crossing the chemical potential, and has no analogue in any clean system. We further identify a strong-coupling phase with $C = 0$ that is nonetheless topologically nontrivial, characterized by a distinct Chern number $C^{(\mathrm{S})} \neq 0$ over the manifold of classical spin configurations. This phase is also disorder-driven, as $C^{(\mathrm{S})} = 0$ in the clean limit.

Abstract: Unidirectional magnetoresistance, or electric magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), is a nonlinear magnetotransport phenomenon that arises in noncentrosymmetric conductors , where changes in resistance $R(B)$ are: (i) chiral, $ΔR(B)/R(0)=2\,χ\, {\bf I}\cdot{\bf B}$, or (ii) polar, $ΔR(B)/R(0)=2\,γ\, {\bf I}\cdot({\bf P}\times{\bf B})$, with eMChA coefficients $χ$ and $γ$. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 106602 (2025)], we showed that the eMChA in the conduction band of tellurene is polar ($χ=0$, $γ\neq 0$) and emerges from the quantum metric dipole due to its Weyl node and from the lone pair polarization ${\bf P}$. Here, we extend our work to the valence band of tellurene, where the eMChA is usually said to be chiral ($χ\neq 0, γ= 0$). We show that also a polar coefficient $γ\neq 0$ emerges naturally through a downfolding procedure, in which remote Weyl-node containing bands induce momentum-space gradients of the quantum metric in the low-energy levels, activating finite metric dipoles. Combining semiclassical Boltzmann transport with a ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ description of tellurene, our numerical calculations agree quantitatively with doping ($μ$) dependent second-harmonic measurements of the longitudinal voltage $V^{2ω}_\parallel(μ)$ in perpendicular field. The combined chiral and polar characters ($χ\neq0, γ\neq 0)$ of the eMChA in tellurene also explains the shift in the angular ($φ$) dependence of $V^{2ω}_\parallel(φ)$ for in plane fields. Our results demonstrate that the polar eMChA can arise in topologically trivial bands through multiband effects and establishes tellurene as a platform for quantum-geometric rectification in both electron and hole regimes.

Abstract: Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory.

Abstract: In quantum-kinetic approaches to the dynamics of Coulomb-bound many-body correlations such as excitons, trions, biexcitons or higher-order correlations, a detailed knowledge of the many-body Coulomb Hamiltonian serving as a starting point is important. In this manuscript, the second-quantized description of the Coulomb interaction between Bloch electrons in a Heisenberg-equation-of-motion approach in atomically thin semiconductors is derived and reviewed. Emphasis is put on a discussion of Umklapp processes and the dielectric screening including all local-field effects. A link between \textit{ab initio} methods of screening and few-band models in effective-mass approximations for the quantum kinetics is established and all important Coulomb scattering processes contributing to the exciton energy landscape and density-independent exciton scattering are discussed.

Abstract: Overheating is a critical bottleneck limiting the performance and reliability of next-generation high-power and high-frequency electronics. Interfacial thermal resistance constitutes a significant portion of the total thermal resistance. In this study, we report an ultrahigh thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of approximately 800 MW/m2-K at the atomically-sharp AlN-SiC interface, achieved through an ion implantation-enhanced nucleation epitaxy technique. This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport but also provide a pathway for effective thermal management in emerging electronic devices.

Motivation: Understanding light activation and exciton dynamics in QD arrays is crucial for optimizing optoelectronic devices, which could enhance efficiency in solar cells and LEDs.

Method: The authors use a model Hamiltonian approach, incorporating dipole-dipole interactions, to analyze quantum properties and exciton localization under varying conditions.

Result: The study identifies phase transitions between localized and delocalized exciton states based on disorder levels and chain lengths, providing insights into controlling exciton transfer in such structures.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the design of efficient optoelectronic systems by elucidating the role of structural defects and disorder in QD propagation dynamics.

Abstract: This paper considers the propagation of excitons in linear chains of QDs with a side defect, located on a dielectric substrate. This configuration is suitable for spatially selective excitation of the system by pulsed optical radiation through the side defect. The dynamics of excitation in the chain is governed by structural disorder, caused by technological variations in the parameters of the QDs themselves and their mutual arrangement. To describe the quantum properties of excitons in the QD chain, a model Hamiltonian is used, taking into account the coupling of neighboring QDs due to dipole-dipole interaction. The localization of stationary states is calculated depending on the magnitude of disorder and the chain length. A criterion is introduced that determines the boundaries of the phase transition from the localized to the delocalized excitation phase. The dynamics of exciton transfer along the QD chain is calculated depending on its length and degree of disorder for linear excitation of the system by a laser pulse. It is shown that dynamic localization emerging in the system corresponds to the stationary localization properties of the states of the chain with a side defect.

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond exists in different charge states with distinct photoluminescence properties, which are sensitive to the nanoscale electrochemical environment. Hence, the NV charge state is emerging as a powerful all-optical platform for nanoscale sensing and imaging. Although significant progress has been made in engineering near-surface NV centers in bulk diamond, controlling the NV charge state in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has proven challenging, limiting the sensitivity and reliability of FND-based charge state sensing. Here, we demonstrate reliable, reversible switching between the fluorescent NV$^0$ and non-fluorescent NV$^+$ charge states in sub-30 nm FNDs via surface oxidation and hydrogenation, respectively, for single particles and particle powder. In aqueous electrochemical cells, we demonstrate voltage and ion concentration imaging based on the NV charge state in self-assembled FND layers on transparent substrates. Applied voltages reliably modulate the FND PL with a sensitivity of up to 16 mV Hz$^{-1/2}$. Importantly, FND PL is also modulated by local changes in salt concentration with a sensitivity of up to 1.8% per millimolar NaCl, enabling all-optical imaging of ion concentration gradients at the microscale. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing fast, stable, and scalable nanoscale charge- and voltage-imaging technologies with sub-micrometer spatial resolution.

Abstract: We propose a novel type of exceptional points, dubbed interaction-enabled $n$-fold exceptional points [EP$n$s ($n=2,3$)] -- EP$n$s protected by topology that are prohibited at the non-interacting level. Specifically, we demonstrate that both bosonic and fermionic systems host such interaction-enabled EP$n$s ($n=2,3$) in parameter space that are protected by charge U(1), pseudo-spin-parity, and $PT$ symmetries. The interaction-enabled EP2s are protected by zero-dimensional topology and give rise to qualitative changes in the loss rate, an experimentally measurable quantity for cold atoms. Furthermore, we reveal that interactions enable EP3s protected by one-dimensional topology beyond the point-gap topological classifications, suggesting the potential presence of a broader class of interaction-enabled non-Hermitian degeneracies.

Abstract: Controlling nonlinear effects in micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems is essential for unlocking their full potential in sensing, signal processing, and frequency control. In this study, we develop a voltage-dependent Hamiltonian framework for a nanoelectromechanical resonator with two strongly coupled vibrational modes, representative of a nanostring platform. The mode frequencies and couplings of the system are tuned electrostatically using a DC voltage, which also controls the strength of the interactions. Our theoretical model reproduces the experimentally observed avoided crossing in the absence of an AC drive and generates tunable frequency-comb spectra when a parametric drive is applied. By scanning the DC voltage, we generate a phase diagram that links comb formation and sharp regime boundaries to underlying bifurcations, multi-stability, and attractor switching. Phase-resolved diagnostics based on a Kuramoto order parameter, together with autocorrelation and Poincaré analyses, quantify coherence and critical slowing down near these transitions. We further explore the relationship between nonlinear coupling, parametric excitation, and stability transitions within a single device of experimental relevance and establish a dynamical framework for engineering nanoelectromechanical resonators that offer enhanced tunability, functionality, and a predictive link to experimental outcomes.

Abstract: Experiments at extreme strain rates and temperatures are critical for characterizing materials in high-speed applications. In this study, we develop a laser-driven particle impact platform capable of accelerating microparticles to supersonic velocities and impacting targets heated to temperatures approaching 2000 °C. The conventional laser-induced particle impact testing (LIPIT) system has been modified to enable high-temperature experiments through the integration of a resistive heating system and the development of a robust launch pad assembly suitable for accelerating particles in high-temperature environments. To eliminate the oxidation of materials at elevated temperatures, an optically accessible portable vacuum chamber has been developed and integrated into the setup. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated through a study of the temperature dependent particle impact cratering behavior of POCO graphite. With this new platform, high-velocity, high-temperature impact experiments can be performed in a controlled environment, supporting the investigation of materials under extreme conditions.

*Shi Chen,Yu Chen*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly in lattice Weyl systems under strong magnetic fields. The anomaly's Lorentz-invariant form is preserved, and a new universal observable κ is introduced, showing a universal B² dependence and angular dependence, independent of system parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of chiral anomalies in strong magnetic fields and their implications for magnetoconductivity and symmetry in lattice systems is the motivation for this work.

Method: The authors use analytical derivation and numerical simulations to study the system's properties under varying magnetic and electric fields, focusing on the magnetoconductivity and anisotropy aspects.

Result: The key result is the universality of the observable κ, which depends only on the angle between E and B, and not on other system parameters. This provides a robust signature for detecting the anomaly.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the chiral anomaly exhibits universal behavior even in the absence of symmetry, offering a new tool for probing topological phases in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: The Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly is shown to retain its Lorentz-invariant form, $\partial_μJ^μ_5 \propto \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$, in lattice Weyl systems beyond moderate magnetic fields, where neither Lorentz nor rotational symmetry is present. We show that the longitudinal and Hall magnetoconductivities factorize into a product of a universal part, governed by the chiral anomaly, and a non-universal part that depends on the density of states at the Fermi level. A rotationally invariant observable $\varkappa = σ(c_V/T)^2$ is introduced as a robust signature of the anomaly, where $σ$ denotes the Euclidean norm of the longitudinal and Hall conductivities and $c_V$ is the specific heat density. This quantity follows a universal $B^2$ dependence and scales as $|\cosΘ|$, with $Θ$ being the angle between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. Through analytical derivation and full numerical simulation, we establish that $\varkappa$ remains universal independent of system parameters and of the orientation of the magnetic or electric field for fixed $Θ$. The emergent SO(3) symmetry in $\varkappa$ persists despite the absence of isotropy in both the microscopic model and the low-energy effective theory.

Motivation: The use of superconducting materials in cryogenic junctions limits their applications, so methods to suppress superconductivity were sought.

Method: TiW alloy and AlOx barriers were used to create a normal-metal tunnel junction on a CMOS-compatible fabrication process.

Result: The junction performs a Coulomb blockade thermometer down to 20 mK, proving effective normal-state operation.

Conclusion: This solution is scalable and enables integration into various advanced electronic systems.

Abstract: Tunnel junctions are one of the key elements of chip-scale microsystems serving various technologies from classical microelectronics to quantum information. Aluminium and its oxide (AlOx) have dominated cryogenic tunnel junction technology for decades due to the high quality of AlOx barriers and Al superconducting properties below 1.2 K. However, many applications require non-superconducting junctions, either standalone or in combination with superconducting technology, motivating efforts to suppress Al superconductivity through magnetic fields, doping, or proximity effects -- approaches that so far suffered from integration compatibility and scalability issues. Here, we present a CMOS-compatible normal-metal tunnel junction technology based on TiW alloy and AlOx barriers. We demonstrate wafer-scale fabrication of TiW/Al-AlOx/TiW junctions and validate their performance in Coulomb blockade thermometers operating down to 20 mK, confirming robust normal-state behavior. This TiW-based architecture offers a scalable solution for non-superconducting tunnel junctions across a broad temperature range, enabling integration into advanced cryogenic, quantum and nanoelectronic chip-level systems.

Abstract: By utilizing the site-dependent spin quantization axis in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) arrays, shuttling-based spin qubit gates have become an appealing approach to realize scalable quantum computing due to the circumvention of using high-frequency driving fields. The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times.

Abstract: Floquet control of band topology is a central theme in ultrafast quantum materials science. Established experimental probes of light-induced topological states include ultrafast transport and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, each with important strengths but also well-known limitations. Here we propose ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) as a real space energy-resolved probe of Floquet physics. We show that THz-STM enables direct local detection of bulk Floquet gaps and distinct Floquet edge state signatures. We derive a nonequilibrium Green's-function formalism for time-dependent tunneling that directly extends standard STM theory and provides an intuitive interpretation of rectified ultrafast tunneling currents. We apply the approach to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons of variable width. For the bulk, we show that THz-STM provides direct spectroscopic access to Floquet-induced gap openings, and we contrast pulsed pump-probe protocols with the continuous-wave Floquet steady-state limit. For finite ribbons, we demonstrate time- and space-resolved imaging of Floquet-induced topological edge states and identify the ribbon-width scale below which edge state protection breaks down. We further show how band structures of graphene nanoribbons and Floquet chiral edge modes can be reconstructed via Floquet quasiparticle interference. Finally we demonstrate that chiral impurities that break time-reversal symmetry induce characteristic spatial THz-STM signatures that can be used as a direct probe of Floquet edge state chirality.

Abstract: Spin textures are ubiquitous in antiferromagnets, yet their consequences for altermagnets remain largely unexplored. We show that spatial variations of the Néel order act on the low-energy electrons as effective gauge fields, leading to strong anisotropies in both dc transport and optical absorption, even without intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. As a concrete example, we analyze a coplanar spin helix and predict that the principal axes of the conductivity and linear dichroism are set by the helix wave vector and can be tuned by the texture geometry. Our results point to polarization-resolved optics and anisotropic transport as direct probes of textured altermagnetic states, and suggest a simple route to direction-selectivity.

Abstract: Entanglement is the hallmark of quantum physics, yet its characterization in interacting many-body systems at thermal equilibrium remains one of the most important challenges in quantum statistical physics. We prove that the Gibbs state of any quantum spin chain can be exactly decomposed into a mixture of matrix product states with a bond dimension that is independent of the system size, at any finite temperature. As a consequence, the Schmidt number, arguably the most stringent measure of bipartite entanglement, is strictly finite for thermal states, even in the thermodynamic limit. Our decomposition is explicit and is accompanied by an efficient classical algorithm to sample the resulting matrix product states.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在通过构建去错 gadgets 实现全逻辑裁剪群体，增强量子计算的容错能力。

Method: 通过研究错体码的去错 gadgets（如全错位式 gadget、代数健备式 gadget 和折叠全错位式 gadget），并证明特定条件下某些 gadgets 不能实现全逻辑裁剪群体，进而限制了多逻辑位码的 going-tolerant 实现。

Result: 单一逻辑位码已知可实现全去错裁剪群体，但多逻辑位码如双及以上逻辑位的正交码则无法实现。

Conclusion: 该研究结果揭示了正交码实现全裁剪群体在多逻辑位上的局限性，提示必须采用更复杂的去错架构来支持多逻辑位量子计算。

Abstract: Identifying stabilizer codes that admit fault-tolerant implementations of the full logical Clifford group would significantly advance fault-tolerant quantum computation. Motivated by this goal, we study several classes of fault-tolerant gadget constructions consisting of Clifford gates acting on the physical qubits, including transversal gadgets, code automorphisms, and fold-transversal gadgets. While stabilizer codes encoding a single logical qubit, most notably the [[7,1,3]] Steane code, are known to admit transversal implementations of the full logical Clifford group, no analogous examples are known for codes encoding multiple logical qubits. In this work, we prove a no-go theorem establishing that no stabilizer code admits a fully transversal implementation of the Clifford group on more than one logical qubit. We further strengthen this result by showing that fold-transversal implementations of the full logical Clifford group are impossible for stabilizer codes encoding more than two logical qubits. More generally, we introduce the notion of k-fold transversal gadgets and prove that implementing the full Clifford group on k logical qubits requires at least k-fold transversal gadgets at the physical level. In addition, we analyze code-automorphism based constructions and demonstrate that they also fail to realize the full Clifford group on multiple logical qubits for any stabilizer code. Together, these results place fundamental constraints on fault-tolerant Clifford gadget design and show that stabilizer codes supporting the full logical Clifford group on multiple logical qubits via these architectures do not exist. Since the Clifford group is a core component of universal gate sets, our findings imply that quantum computing with codes encoding multiple logical qubits within a single code block necessarily entails more complex constructions for fault tolerance.

Abstract: Quantum error correction offers a promising path to suppress errors in quantum processors, but the resources required to protect logical operations from noise, especially non-Clifford operations, pose a substantial challenge to achieve practical quantum advantage in the early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) era. In this work, we develop a systematic scheme to encode exponential maps of the form $\exp(-iθP)$ into stabilizer codes with simple circuit structures and low qubit overhead. We provide encoded circuits with small first-order logical error rate after postselection for the [[n, n-2, 2]] quantum error-detecting codes and the [[5, 1, 3]], [[7, 1, 3]], and [[15, 7, 3]] quantum error-correcting codes. Detailed analysis shows that under the level of physical noise of current devices, our encoding scheme is 4--7 times less noisy than the unencoded operation, while at most 3% of runs need to be discarded.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In a previous work we developed a field theoretical approach to open quantum systems using condensed matter methods. In the Born approximation we derived the Redfield equation on the basis of a multi-oscillator bath, a Dyson equation, a diagrammatic expansion and a quasi-particle approximation. In addition applying a rotating wave approximation we obtained the Lindblad equation describing a proper quantum map. The issue regarding the additional rotating wave approximation was left as an open problem.
  The present work addresses the open problem and presents new results. We identify a discrepancy in the popular and standard Redfield equation. The discrepancy is associated with the well-known fact that the Redfield equation does not represent a proper quantum map. The discrepancy is related to the diagrammatic expansion and a consistency requirement in the quasi-particle approximation. The explicit resolution of this discrepancy is obtained by imposing energy conservation on the Born level. As a result we obtain formal equivalence between the energy-conserving Redfield equation and the Lindblad equation without invoking the rotating wave approximation. We provide a detailed mapping of the field theoretical approach to the standard microscopic derivation in the theory of open quantum systems.

Conclusion: 通过量子框架扩展 CTEM 模型，为更复杂场景提供基础。

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) image formation using a fault-tolerant, gate-based quantum circuit model. The electron wavefield on an $N\times N$ grid is amplitude-encoded into a $2\log_2 N$-qubit register. Free-space propagation and objective-lens aberrations are implemented via two-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs) and diagonal phase operators in reciprocal space, while specimen interaction is modeled under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA) as a position-dependent phase grating. We validate projected potentials, contrast transfer function (CTF) behavior, and image contrast trends against classical multislice simulations for MoS$_2$ over experimentally relevant parameters, and provide resource estimates and key assumptions that determine end-to-end runtime. While extracting complete $N\times N$ intensity images requires $O(N^2/ε^2)$ measurements that preclude advantage for full-image reconstruction, the framework enables quantum advantage for tasks requiring Fourier-space queries, global image statistics, or phase-coherent observables inaccessible to classical intensity-only detection. This framework provides a physics-grounded mapping from CTEM theory to quantum circuits and establishes a baseline for extending toward full multislice and inelastic scattering models.

Abstract: We study relativistic twisted (orbital-angular-momentum) states of a massive charged particle propagating through an axially symmetric, longitudinally inhomogeneous solenoid field and a co-directed accelerating or decelerating electric field. Starting from the Dirac equation and using controlled spinless and paraxial approximations, we show that the transverse envelope obeys an effective nonstationary Schrödinger equation governed by a Caldirola--Kanai Hamiltonian. The longitudinal energy gain or loss encoded in $f(z)=[E_0-V(z)]^2-m^2$ generates an effective gain or damping rate $\widetildeγ(z)=\partial_z f(z)/[2f(z)]$ and a $z$-dependent oscillator frequency $\widetildeω(z)=p_0Ω(z)/\sqrt{f(z)}$. Exploiting the Ermakov mapping (unitary equivalence of Caldirola--Kanai systems), we obtain a closed-form propagated twisted wave function by transforming the stationary Landau basis. The transverse evolution is controlled by a single scaling function $b(z)$ that satisfies a generalized Ermakov--Pinney equation with coefficients determined by $E_z(z)$ and $B_z(z)$. In the limiting cases of uniform acceleration with $B_z=0$ and of solenoid focusing with negligible acceleration, our solution reduces to previously known analytic results, providing a direct bridge to established models.

Abstract: The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is central to the analysis of uniformly sampled signals, yet many practical applications involve non-uniform sampling, requiring the Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform (NUDFT). While quantum algorithms for the standard DFT are well established, a corresponding framework for the non-uniform case remains underdeveloped. This work introduces a quantum algorithm for the Non-Uniform Quantum Fourier Transform (NUQFT) based on a low-rank factorization of the NUDFT matrix. The factorization is translated into an explicit quantum construction using block encodings, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Linear Combination of Unitaries framework, yielding an $ε$-accurate block encoding of the NUDFT matrix with controlled approximation error from both classical truncation and quantum implementation. Under standard oracle access assumptions for non-uniform sampling points, we derive explicit, non-asymptotic gate-level resource estimates. The resulting complexity scales polylogarithmically with target precision, quadratically with the number of qubits through the quantum Fourier transform, and logarithmically with a geometry-dependent conditioning parameter induced by the non-uniform grid. This establishes a concrete and resource-efficient quantum analogue of the NUDFT and provides a foundation for quantum algorithms on irregularly sampled data.

Abstract: We derive the Ward-Takahashi identity and establish the gauge-invariant response theory for open quantum systems described by Lindbladians to show that particle-number conservation is not necessary to satisfy gauge invariance. We construct an observable which can be used to test the gauge invariance in the absence of particle-number conservation. We derive the low-energy collective modes that emerge as a consequence of gauge invariance in open quantum systems, and find that two-body loss induces diffusive modes in dissipative Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity. Possible experimental situations for testing gauge invariance in open quantum systems are also discussed.

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are a flexible and ubiquitous model for discrete optimization problems. Solving ILPs is \textsf{NP-Hard} yet of great practical importance. Super-quadratic quantum speedups for ILPs have been difficult to obtain because classical algorithms for many-constraint ILPs are global and exhaustive, whereas quantum frameworks that offer super-quadratic speedup exploit local structure of the objective and feasible set. We address this via quantum algorithms for Gomory's group relaxation. The group relaxation of an ILP is obtained by dropping nonnegativity on variables that are positive in the optimal solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation, while retaining integrality of the decision variables. We present a competitive feasibility-preserving classical local-search algorithm for the group relaxation, and a corresponding quantum algorithm that, under reasonable technical conditions, achieves a super-quadratic speedup. When the group relaxation satisfies a nondegeneracy condition analogous to, but stronger than, LP non-degeneracy, our approach yields the optimal solution to the original ILP. Otherwise, the group relaxation tightens bounds on the optimal objective value of the ILP, and can improve downstream branch-and-cut by reducing the integrality gap; we numerically observe this on several practically relevant ILPs. To achieve these results, we derive efficiently constructible constraint-preserving mixers for the group relaxation with favorable spectral properties, which are of independent interest.

Abstract: We introduce dissipative spectroscopy as a framework for extracting spectral information from quantum systems via controlled dissipation. By establishing a general dissipative response theory applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian environments, we develop a protocol to access the dissipative spectrum (DS) through driven oscillation-dissipation resonance. We show that the DS can identify two-particle soft modes near quantum critical points and, on the normal-phase side, predict the emergence of macroscopic order exhibiting power-law growth following a dissipation quench. These distinctive signatures appear in quasiparticle-dominant regimes, previously considered trivial. Furthermore, we introduce extended dissipative susceptibilities that capture leading memory effects and demonstrate their utility in a dissipative fermionic model. Our results indicate that the DS is readily accessible and offers a versatile tool for probing equilibrium properties as well as predicting nonequilibrium dissipative dynamics.

Abstract: Entanglement is a central resource in quantum information science; therefore, it is important to design local discrimination protocols that minimize resource consumption. In this paper, we propose three entanglement-allocation schemes for the local discrimination of particular unextendible product bases (UPB) exhibiting strong quantum nonlocality in a \(3 \otimes 3 \otimes 3\) system. By exploiting the structural features of these UPB and the operational advantages of maximally entangled states, we further extend our protocols to strongly nonlocal UPB in \(d \otimes d \otimes d\) systems. In particular, we show that these UPB can be perfectly distinguished with only two maximally entangled states. Moreover, a resource-cost analysis indicates that our protocols, which avoid quantum teleportation whenever possible, can reduce the entanglement consumption. These results not only facilitate resource-efficient quantum information processing, but also provide further insight into the operational role of maximally entangled states.

Abstract: One-dimensional chains of coupled spins are minimal models of strongly correlated quantum matter, and have been proposed as wires for transporting quantum information. In liquids, rapid molecular tumbling averages anisotropic dipolar couplings and leaves effective isotropic scalar $J$-coupling Hamiltonians. At zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) conditions, differences in frequency between nuclear spins of different types are quenched and the internal Hamiltonians can be closely approximated by an isotropic Heisenberg model. In this work, we present [U-$^{13}$C,$^{15}$N]-butyronitrile as a chemically engineered nuclear spin chain whose full spin-spin coupling network can be determined and validated by combining high-field NMR detection with evolution at ultralow fields. Starting from high-field (16.4 T) NMR spectra of $^1$H, $^{13}$C, and $^{15}$N nuclei, we extract all relevant $J$-couplings within a 12-spin network (four $^{13}$C, one $^{15}$N, and seven $^1$H). We then employ a mechanical field-cycling apparatus to prepolarize the spins at high field, shuttle them into a magnetically shielded region for evolution at <50 nT, and detect signals after returning to high field. Fourier analysis of the ultralow-field evolution yields indirect $J$-spectra that are conceptually analogous to ZULF NMR spectra but measured by a high-field NMR spectrometer. We observe clear spectral features at $J$, 1.5$J$, and 2$J$, in good agreement with simulations using the extracted coupling matrix. Finally, we demonstrate 2D experiments that correlate high-field chemical shifts and, thus, fully map interactions within the molecular spin chain. Our results establish [U-$^{13}$C,$^{15}$N]-butyronitrile as an extremely well-characterized spin chain model system and provide a quantitative Hamiltonian benchmark for future hyperpolarization and quantum-control studies.

Abstract: We propose a flux-pumped superconducting parametric amplifier based on symmetrically threaded superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) that achieves a Kerr-free operating point under suitable drive conditions. Eliminating the Kerr nonlinearity is advantageous for quantum-limited amplification, as it mitigates unwanted distortions in squeezing and prevents degradation of both gain and quantum efficiency in the high-gain strong drive regime. By replacing the central junction in the symmetrically threaded SQUIDs (STS) configuration with a linear inductor, we find that the Kerr-nonlinearity can be eliminated and the effective Hamiltonian reduces to that of a degenerate parametric amplifier (DPA), up to higher-order corrections in the zero-point fluctuations of the superconducting phase operator. We show that the deviations from ideal DPA behavior introduced by these higher-order terms are significantly weaker than those associated with a Kerr nonlinearity. Consequently, the STS design can be driven strongly while maintaining near-quantum-limited performance at the Kerr-free point. Our analysis predicts phase-preserving gain and efficiency approaching the quantum limit, with robust operation demonstrated up to 25 dB of gain.

Abstract: A major challenge in open quantum dynamics is the inclusion of Matsubara-decay terms in the memory kernel, which arise from the quantum-Boltzmann delocalisation of the bath modes. This delocalisation can be quantified by the radius of gyration squared ${\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ of the imaginary-time Feynman paths of the bath modes as a function of the frequency $ω$. In a Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) calculation with a Debye--Drude spectral density, ${\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ is the only quantity that is treated approximately (assuming convergence with respect to hierarchy depth). Here, we show that the well-known Ishizaki--Tanimura correction is equivalent to separating smooth from `Brownian' contributions to ${\mathcal R}^2(ω)$, and that modifying the correction leads to a more efficient HEOM in the case of fast baths. We also develop a simple `A4' adaptation of the `AAA' (Adaptive Antoulas--Anderson) algorithm in order to fit ${\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ to a sum over poles, which results in an extremely efficient implementation of the standard HEOM method at low temperatures.

TL;DR: This paper proposes and experimentally verifies a model system for controllable two-magnon interference in a hybrid cavity magnonic system, achieving a magnonic N00N state with tunable phase sensitivity, which could pave the way for novel magnon-based quantum metrological devices and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation likely stems from the potential applications of magnonics in quantum metrology and computing, driven by the need for improved sensitivity and integration of quantum devices.

Method: The researchers experimentally realized the proposed model using a hybrid cavity magnonic system comprising two coupled magnon modes. They implemented a time-dependent magnetic field to control the magnon modes and observe the interference effects.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate the successful generation of a maximally entangled magnonic N00N state with tunable phase sensitivity, validating the theoretical model of two-magnon interference.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of magnon interference phenomena and provides a foundation for the development of quantum metrological devices and hybrid magnonic quantum computing architectures by demonstrating a controllable two-magnon interference system with practical applications Potential implications include enhanced quantum sensing and computing capabilities using magnons.

Abstract: This letter presents a model system for controllable two-magnon interference in the time domain. This two-magnon interference, i.e., a magnonic analog to the photonic Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, is supported by a tunable magnonic beamsplitter operation formed in a hybrid cavity magnonic system comprising a pair of mutually coupled magnon modes. By applying a time-dependent magnetic field, magnons can be excited independently in each mode and subsequently brought into interaction, shifting from independent to collective oscillations, to realize a controllable magnonic beamsplitter. When the beamsplitter operation is applied to an initially unentangled two-magnon state, a maximally entangled magnonic $N00N$ state with tunable phase sensitivity is produced. These findings suggest that two-magnon interference in hybrid cavity magnonic systems may enable novel quantum metrological devices to study fundamental magnon dynamics and contribute to developing hybrid magnonic quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: We present a digitized implementation of rapid adiabatic passage based on a train of weak, frequency-varying ultrafast pulses. Analytic conditions on the subpulse Rabi frequencies and detunings are derived to reproduce the continuous-time population dynamics of a conventional long-pulse excitation. We find that the reproduced dynamics achieves high fidelity even for pulse trains with a small number of subpulses, provided that each subpulse remains within the perturbative regime. The subpulses act as discrete samples of the underlying continuous evolution; consequently, more complex population dynamics, characterized by multiple oscillations prior to the onset of adiabaticity, require a larger number of subpulses for accurate reproduction. In addition, we demonstrate how the sidebands of a frequency comb can be exploited for resonant excitation at large carrier detuning and for the precise preparation of superposition states.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework that extends single-reference (SR) coupled-cluster (CC) theory beyond its conventional role of describing a single electronic state-typically the lowest-energy state within the symmetry sector defined by the reference determinant. Rather than viewing the SR-CC cluster operator solely as a device for reproducing one target state, we consider more general constructions in which different components of the cluster operator play distinct roles, ranging from encoding states of different symmetry than the reference to enabling SR-CC Ansatz to describe multiple states simultaneously. These developments lead to a new class of SR-CC downfolding formalisms in which the resulting active-space effective Hamiltonians are capable of concurrently representing multiple correlated states nonorthogonal to the reference function. We establish three theorems that formalize this extension and demonstrate that standard CC downfolding emerges as a special case of the proposed framework. Finally, we introduce a Hermitian variant based on a unitary CC representation, which enables realistic simulations of ground and excited states while reducing the quantum resources required.

Abstract: We discuss a scheme to generate large Fock states. The scheme involves repeatedly applying an experimentally feasible unitary transformation to convert a semiclassical state into a Fock state. The transformation combines Kerr interaction, which is a non-Gaussian operation, and pulsed coherent drives. We identify suitable parameter values (Kerr strength, pulse timings, displacement amplitude) for the physical processes to implement the transformation and generate large Fock states with near-unity fidelity. The feasibility of implementing the scheme in circuit QED architectures is discussed. The method is also suitable for generating Fock states of cavity fields.

Abstract: We present for the first time a general theory of error correction for permutation invariant (PI) codes. Using representation theory of the symmetric group we construct efficient algorithms that can correct any correctible error on any PI code. These algorithms involve measurements of total angular momentum, quantum Schur transforms or logical state teleportations, and geometric phase gates. For erasure errors, or more generally deletion errors, on certain PI codes, we give a simpler quantum error correction algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how quantum light affects strong-field photoelectron holography, identifying that photon-number fluctuations, specifically from phase-squeezed light, disrupt holographic contrast by causing rapid collapse of fringe visibility.

Conclusion: Quantum-optical sensitivity enables metrological gains in field noise estimation through holography, paves the way for improved measurements in quantum information science, and suggests new avenues for attosecond-scale studies of quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Bridging quantum optics and strong-field physics provides a pathway to explore how quantum light shapes extreme nonlinear light-matter interactions. However, direct characterization of non-classical light at damage-threshold intensities remains an open question. Here, we theoretically investigate the impact of photon-number fluctuations of squeezed light on strong-field photoelectron holography using a quantum-optical strong-field approximation. We identify a mechanism, ponderomotive dephasing, whereby the inherent quantum fluctuations of the driving field dictate the stability of the electron's semiclassical action. While amplitude-squeezed light stabilizes the action to enhance holographic contrast, phase-squeezed light amplifies photon-number noise, causing a rapid collapse of fringe visibility. This quantum-optical sensitivity follows a steep quartic wavelength scaling, rendering mid-infrared drivers uniquely sensitive to the field's underlying quantum nature. Crucially, we show that the collapse of holographic contrast is not a loss of information but a metrological gain. By evaluating the Classical Fisher Information, we identify a "dark-port" mechanism in the tunneling tail that enables the estimation of field quadrature noise beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This fundamental trade-off between structural imaging fidelity and statistical sensitivity establishes the framework for Attosecond Quantum Tomography: an in-situ, reference-free protocol to reconstruct the Wigner distribution of intense quantum light. Our results identify strong-field ionization as a nonlinear quantum transducer, bridging attosecond electron dynamics with quantum information science.

Abstract: This paper introduces a group-theoretic framework to analyze the algebraic structure of the Grover walk on a complete graph with self-loops. We construct a group generated by the Grover matrix and a diagonal matrix whose entries are powers of a complex root of unity. We then characterize the resulting quotient group, which is defined using a subgroup formed by commutators involving these matrices. We show that this quotient group is isomorphic to a finite cyclic group whose structure depends on the parity of the number of vertices. This group-theoretic characterization reveals underlying symmetries in the time evolution of the Grover walk and provides an algebraic framework for understanding its periodic behavior.

Abstract: Synthetic frequency dimension offers a powerful approach to simulate lattice models and control photon dynamics. However, extending this concept into the quantum regime, particularly at the single-photon level, has remained challenging in photonic platforms. Here, we demonstrate quantum-state initialization and detection of single-photon evolutions within a synthetic frequency lattice by integrating a superconducting qubit with a 16-meter aluminum coaxial cable. A tunable superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based modulator is employed to synthesize lattice couplings and artificial gauge fields. We observe single-photon quantum random walks and Bloch oscillations, as well as nonadiabatic, unidirectional frequency conversion under rapid temporal modulation of the lattice Hamiltonian, together with band-structure measurements. The lattice connectivity can be readily reconfigured to construct higher-dimensional lattices using multiple drive tones. Our results establish superconducting quantum circuits as a versatile platform for programmable Hamiltonians and extensible synthetic lattices with flexible single-photon control.

Abstract: Aharonov-Bohm (AB) caging is a complete localization phenomenon in two-dimensional lattices due to destructive interference induced by the background gauge fields. However, current investigations of AB caging are mostly restricted to the Abelian gauge field case, and the observation of AB caging under non-Abelian gauge fields in a quantum system still remains elusive. Here, we report experimental realization of tunable synthetic non-Abelian SU(2) gauge fields in a rhombic lattice, engineered within the synthetic dimensions of a vibrating trapped ion with multiple levels. We realize AB caging under both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields and systematically investigate the distinctive transport properties of the non-Abelian case. In particular, we observe typical emergent quantum dynamics unique to non-Abelian AB caging, including initial-state-dependent dynamics, second-order effects, and asymmetric caging behavior. These observations demonstrate the trapped ion system as a powerful platform for simulating emergent phenomena in high-dimensional quantum systems with exotic synthetic gauge fields.

### [81] [Field-Tunable Meissner-Levitated Ferromagnetic Microsphere Sensor for Cryogenic Casimir and Short-Range Gravity Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13829)
*Yi-Chong Ren,Feng Xu,Wijnand Broer,Xiao-Jing Chen,Fei Xue*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose a quantum force-gradient sensor for measuring near-field forces at submicron separations, including Casimir effects and short-range interactions. The sensor uses a Meissner-levitated ferromagnetic microsphere above a superconducting plane, with a bias magnetic field to control the separation for in situ scans. The force gradient is detected via a resonance-frequency shift tracked by a phase-locked loop, and the motion is measured using a flux-tunable microwave resonator. The sensor operates at cryogenic temperatures and can achieve sensitivities of ~10^{-19} N Hz^{-1/2}. The design requires only cryogenic operation and soft biomaterials for long-term stability. The sensor can reach the standard quantum limit (SQL) via a counterintuitive scaling law that makes larger microspheres require fewer photons to reach the SQL, providing a pathway to sub-microsecond measurement times without optical heating. This enables macroscopic quantum metrology, which can suppress electrostatic patch potentials and eddy-current dissipation by using an Au coating. Current estimates for force sensitivity are around 10^{-19} N Hz^{1/2} at millikelvin temperatures. Future work should investigate calibration, repeatability, and the suppression of electrostatic patch potentials and eddy-current dissipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  macroscale quantum metrology may provide new insights into fundamental physics questions, including the nature of gravity at short distances. Current methods of force metrology are limited by quantum noise scaling as the square root of the bandwidth, so reaching the standard quantum limit would allow larger measurement bandwidths without increasing the quantum noise. This could enable macroscopic quantum metrology which could suppress the contributions to the background forces that limit current measurements. The ultimate aim is to achieve force sensitivity competitive with those achieved for quantum sensing of acceleration in space-based gravitational wave detectors like LISA.

Method:  The authors propose a self-calibrating quantum force-gradient sensor using a Meissner-levitated ferromagnetic microsphere above a type-I superconducting plane. A bias magnetic field is used to reproducibly tune the equilibrium gap for in situ separation scans. The force gradient is encoded as a resonance-frequency shift tracked by a phase-locked loop, with the motion read out using a flux-tunable microwave resonator. The sensor is designed to work at cryogenic temperatures and can suppress electrostatic patch potentials and eddy-current dissipation by using an Au coating on the microsphere.

Result:  The work derives conditions for reaching the standard quantum limit for the sensor and identifies a counterintuitive scaling law, where larger microspheres require fewer photons to reach the SQL. The authors quantify force sensitivities of ~10^{-19} N Hz^{-1/2} at millikelvin temperatures. The design avoids optical heating and requires only cryogenic operation and stable, soft biomaterials for the microsphere. The sensor enables measurement of force gradients at submicron separations and provides protocols for extracting Casimir pressure and constraining Yukawa-type deviations from Newtonian gravity over distances ranging from 0.1 to  10 micrometers.

Conclusion:  The proposed quantum force-gradient sensor represents a significant step toward macroscopic quantum metrology and realizing the standard quantum limit for force sensing. By utilizing a counterintuitive scaling law, the sensor's design allows for improved sensitivity and the potential to achieve sub-microsecond measurement times without optical heating. This advancement could pave the way for precision measurements of Casimir forces and tests of short-range fundamental forces, such as Yukawa interactions that deviate from Newtonian gravity, particularly at submicron separations.

Abstract: Near-field force measurements at submicron separations can probe Casimir effects and hypothetical short-range interactions, but require cryogenic operation and stable, \textit{in situ} control of separation-dependent backgrounds. We propose a self-calibrating quantum force-gradient sensor in which a ferromagnetic microsphere is Meissner-levitated above a type-I superconducting plane, while a bias magnetic field reproducibly tunes the equilibrium gap for in situ separation scans without mechanical approach. The force gradient is encoded as a resonance-frequency shift tracked by a phase-locked loop, and the motion is read out with a SQUID-coupled, flux-tunable microwave resonator that provides adjustable measurement strength without optical heating. Using the input--output formalism, we derive the conditions for reaching the standard quantum limit (SQL) and identify a counterintuitive scaling law: because displacement-to-flux transduction increases with microsphere size, larger microspheres require fewer photons to reach the SQL, enabling a pathway to macroscopic quantum metrology. We quantify the trade-off between suppression of electrostatic patch potentials (via Au coating) and eddy-current dissipation, project force sensitivities of $\sim 10^{-19}\,\rm{N\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ at millikelvin temperatures, and outline protocols to extract Casimir pressure and constrain Yukawa-type deviations from Newtonian gravity over $0.1$--$10\,μ\mathrm{m}$.

Abstract: Frequency-bin encoding has recently emerged as a powerful approach for photonic quantum information processing, offering high dimensionality, gate-parallelization, and compatibility with existing telecommunication infrastructure. However, its scalable deployment has so far been hindered by the lack of an integrated platform capable of unifying quantum state generation, coherent frequency mixing, and programmable spectral control.\\ Here, we report the first fully integrated quantum frequency processor, monolithically integrating on the same silicon photonic chip a microresonator-based biphoton quantum frequency comb source, a pump-rejection filter, high-speed phase modulators, and a four-channel, line-by-line pulse shaper. We demonstrate key functionalities, such as tunable frequency beamsplitters with success probabilities exceeding $94\%$ and fidelities above $99.9\%$, as well as the ability to synthesize more general single-qubit gates. Finally, we generate and coherently manipulate high-dimensional frequency-bin entangled states entirely on chip, showcasing control over two-photon quantum walks and performing the first on-chip frequency-bin quantum state tomography of a Bell-state with a fidelity of $95.7(3)\%$. By integrating all key functional elements on the same $4\times7\,\textrm{mm}^2$ chip, with the possibility of scaling to a larger number of modes, our work marks an important step toward large-scale frequency-domain photonic processors for both classical and quantum applications.

Abstract: Rydberg blockade gates are the most experimentally mature entangling operations in neutral-atom quantum processors, combining fast gate times with simple control, but their performance degrades at larger interatomic separations and remains sensitive to motional and technical noise. Non-blockade gate schemes, such as dark-state and geometric protocols, offer complementary robustness but typically rely on complex and experimentally demanding control. Here we show that quantum optimal control enables non-blockade gate schemes to be implemented using the experimentally established pulse-shaping techniques developed for blockade-based gates. Focusing on the dark-state gate, we construct non-adiabatic implementations that preserve the intrinsic robustness of adiabatic dark-state protocols while achieving gate times comparable to time-optimal blockade gates using only smooth, experimentally feasible pulses. The resulting gates exhibit enhanced resilience to motional coupling, laser noise, and interaction inhomogeneity, particularly near and beyond the blockade radius. This work establishes a practical route to fast, robust two-qubit gates without increased experimental complexity.

Abstract: We realize a hardware-native time--frequency Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) logical qubit encoded in the continuous phase space of single photons, establishing a propagating photonic implementation of bosonic grid encoding. Finite-energy grid states are generated deterministically using coherently driven entangled nonlinear biphoton sources that produce single-photon frequency-comb supermodes. An optical-frequency-comb reference anchors the time--frequency phase space and enforces commuting displacement stabilizers directly at the hardware level, continuously defining the logical subspace. Timing jitter, spectral drift, and phase noise map naturally onto Gaussian displacement errors within this lattice, yielding intrinsic correctability inside a stabilizer cell. Logical operations correspond to experimentally accessible phase and delay controls, enabling deterministic state preparation and manipulation. Building on the modal time--frequency GKP framework, we identify a concrete pathway toward active syndrome extraction and deterministic displacement recovery using ancillary grid states and interferometric time--frequency measurements. These primitives establish a hardware-compatible route for integrating the time--frequency GKP logical layer into erasure-aware and fusion-based fault-tolerant photonic architectures.

Abstract: We extend a perturbative Dyson-type treatment and discrete-symmetry constraints from the Schrödinger and von Neumann equations to a dephasing Lindblad framework. This work develops further the odd-symmetric formulation -- based on stochastic realism and dual temporal boundary conditions -- from general dynamical considerations to specific tools of quantum mechanics. Applying the resulting scaling relations to published single- and double-diffractive data in $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ collisions (ISR, UA4, UA5, CDF, D0, ALICE, and E710), we show that single-diffraction cross sections are well described by a three-parameter fit with a relative RMS deviation of $\sim 4\%$, substantially improving upon conventional approximations that neglect decoherence. The extracted decoherence factor is consistently $φ\approx 0.89$, in agreement across SD, DD, and E710-based (direct) estimates, and is naturally interpreted as $φ=1$ for CP-invariant dephasing but $φ<1$ for CPT-invariant dephasing, favouring the latter.

Abstract: A fascinating effect belonging to the field of vacuum forces and fluctuations is that of quantum friction. It refers to the prediction of a dissipative force acting on a moving object due to the quantum vacuum field. In this work, we investigate rotational quantum friction where a diatomic polar molecule rotates around its own center of mass in free space. We quantize the rotational motion and investigate the resulting dissipation due to spontaneous decay. We find in the Markovian regime that a friction torque $\propto Ω^3$ persists even for zero temperature, and in agreement with the classical result in the limit of large rotational quantum number $l$. Within the non-Markovian short-time regime we find a friction $\proptoΩ$.

Motivation: Quantum state measurement is a fundamental aspect of quantum optics and quantum information science. The ability to detect and analyze quantum states in the time domain is particularly important for understanding quantum systems with temporal degrees of freedom.

Method: The paper uses balanced homodyne detection to measure quantum states in the time domain. The method involves projecting quantum states into natural detector bases associated with temporal modes. An algorithm is developed to simulate the photocurrent of continuous homodyne detection for temporally resolved modes, and this algorithm is used to assess the impact of realistic measurement errors on state reconstruction techniques.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum state detection and practical implementation, offering a valuable tool for studying quantum systems with temporal modes in real-time conditions.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the time domain measurement of temporally resolvable quantum states using balanced homodyne detection. Our approach outlines a formalism of detecting quantum states in arbitrary temporal modes via projection of the temporal mode onto a natural detector basis. We then present an algorithm for simulating the resultant photocurrent of continuous homodyne detection in the presence of a temporally resolved mode, and use this algorithm to explore the effects of realistic measurement errors on marginal reconstruction and quantum state tomography. A complete implementation of the method is provided through open source code on a GitHub repository.

### [89] [Wideband Quantum Transduction for Rydberg Atomic Receivers Using Six-Wave Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13955)
*Yuanbin Chen,Chau Yuen,Chong Meng Samson See*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Six-wave mixing (SWM) enhances the 3-dB baseband bandwidth of Rydberg atomic receivers by >10x compared to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) while maintaining high electric field sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wideband wireless applications require high bandwidth wireless receivers with high sensitivity.

Method: Developed an explicit baseband input-output model and derived a closed-form expression for 3-dB bandwidth dependence on system parameters.

Result: SWM-based receiver achieves significantly higher bandwidth (>10x) with comparable sensitivity.

Conclusion: SWM-based receivers are suitable for high-bandwidth wireless applications with compatible performance characteristics.

Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers hold extremely high sensitivity to electric fields, yet their effective 3-dB baseband bandwidth under conventional electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is typically constrained to tens to a few hundreds of kilohertz, which hinders wideband wireless applications. To relax this bottleneck, we investigate a six-wave mixing (SWM)-based Rydberg atomic receiver as a wideband radio frequency (RF)-to-optical quantum transducer. Specifically, we develop an explicit baseband input-output model spanning from the probe input to the output light field. Based upon this model, a closed-form 3-dB bandwidth expression is derived to expose its dependence on key optical and RF parameters. We further quantify the linear dynamic range by employing the 1-dB compression point (P1dB) and the input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3), unveiling a communication-compatible characterization of the bandwidth-linearity trade-off. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate that, given identical optical driving conditions, the SWM configuration increases the 3-dB baseband bandwidth by more than an order of magnitude compared to the EIT-based counterpart, while retaining comparable electric-field sensitivity and revealing a broad, tunable linear operating region.

Abstract: Transversal Pauli Z rotations provide a natural route to fault-tolerant logical diagonal gates in quantum CSS codes, yet their capability is fundamentally constrained. In this work, we formulate the refinement problem of realizing a logical diagonal gate by a transversal implementation with a finer discrete rotation angle and show that its solvability is completely characterized by the Bockstein homomorphism in homology theory. Furthermore, we prove that the linear independence of the X-stabilizer generators together with the commutativity condition modulo a power of two ensures the existence of transversal implementations of all logical Pauli Z rotations with discrete angles in general CSS codes. Our results identify a canonical homological obstruction governing transversal implementability and provide a conceptual foundation for a formal theory of transversal structures in quantum error correction.

Abstract: We provide an explicit geometric classification of single-qubit projective measurements on one-dimensional linear cluster states within a topological framework. By establishing an explicit geometrical correspondence between local measurements and topological surgery operations on an associated link model i.e. a measurement surgery correspondence, we represent the cluster state as a linear Hopf chain. Within this model, measurements in the computational ($Z$) basis act as topological severance in case of bulk measurements while boundary pruning happens for end measurements of qubits. In contrast, transverse ($X$) basis measurements remove the measured qubit while splicing its neighbours, preserving connectivity through real valued correlations. We show that lateral ($Y$) basis measurements also preserve connectivity but generate intrinsically complex phase factors that are not captured by unframed link models, rendering X and Y measurements topologically indistinguishable at the level of connectivity alone. To resolve this ambiguity, we introduce a framed ribbon representation in which quantum phases are encoded as geometric twists, with chiral $\pm 90^\circ} twists corresponding to the phases $\pm i$. This framing yields a phase-sensitive and outcome resolved topological description of all single qubit measurements on linear cluster states. Our approach provides a unified geometric interpretation of measurement-induced entanglement transformations in measurement-based quantum computation, revealing that quantum phases correspond directly to framed topological invariants. The work is restricted to one-dimensional linear cluster states and single-qubit measurements in the Pauli bases.

Abstract: Emitter ensembles constitute a fundamental component in quantum optical technologies, yet efficient and accurate simulation of large ensembles remains challenging. Here, we formulate a truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for permutation-invariant emitter ensembles subject to local dissipation by sampling stochastic trajectories in an extended phase space encompassing the Bloch sphere. Benchmarks show that the TWA accurately captures dynamics, including nonclassical signatures, with the approximation improving with ensemble size. We demonstrate large-scale simulations of hundreds of interacting ensembles within the TWA to reveal emergent spatial coherence and selective directionality of cooperative emission in a pumped 1D chain, highlighting a practical path to studying extended light-matter systems. Our results expand the scope of scalable simulations of quantum emitter ensembles, establishing a bridge between microscopic models and emergent behavior.

Abstract: Recent experiments on donor-based spin qubits in silicon have leveraged the exchange interaction between electrons bound to separate donor nuclei to perform two-qubit operations. A consistently observed yet unexplained phenomenon in such systems is the significant increase in electron readout contrast, measured via Elzerman-style readout to a single-electron transistor (SET) island, when the donor nuclei are initialized in a parallel spin orientation compared to an anti-parallel orientation. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the exchange-coupled donor system in the parallel nuclear regime and propose a physical mechanism for this effect. We attribute the enhanced readout contrast to an additional electron tunneling event to the SET during a single read period, when the donor nuclei are aligned in a parallel spin configuration. These insights inform strategies for improving electron readout fidelity in these systems and contribute to a more complete understanding of spin-dependent tunnelling processes in donor-based qubit architectures.

Abstract: The formulation of a consistent measurement theory for relativistic quantum fields has become a problem of growing foundational and practical significance. Standard non-relativistic measurement models fail to incorporate the essential relativistic principles of locality, causality, and Lorentz covariance, and are therefore inadequate for quantum field theoretic settings. While most existing work focuses on scalar fields, realistic particles possess spin, polarization, and internal degrees of freedom that introduce new conceptual and operational challenges. To this end, we employ the Quantum Temporal Probabilities (QTP) framework for relativistic measurements to describe electromagnetic, Dirac, and internally structured scalar fields. Our results include probabilities for the time-of-arrival that take spin/polarization into account, generalized photodetection formulas beyond Glauber's theory, an unambiguous derivation of the particle oscillation formula together with its limitations, and a first-principles analysis of relativistic qudits.

Abstract: Spin squeezing generated via inter-atom entanglement in multilevel atomic ensembles provides a powerful resource for quantum-enhanced metrology. Existing schemes that harness internal atomic degrees of freedom to boost squeezing typically encode the collective squeezing in complex superpositions of magnetic sublevels, which complicates state control and limits practical applications. Here, we propose a coherent control scheme that simultaneously enhances collective spin squeezing and maps the resulting atom-atom entanglement onto two well-defined magnetic sublevels suitable for subsequent metrology experiments. Our protocol sandwiches a quantum non-demolition measurement between two internal one-axis-twisting interactions arranged in an echo sequence. We show that this approach can optimally leverage internal states to boost the inter-atom entanglement and, at the same time, encode it in two magnetic sublevels, which is readily convertible into metrologically useful spin squeezing. Our results offer a straightforward and efficient strategy for generating highly entangled yet readily accessible quantum states in multilevel atomic systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of the boundary conditions in the numerical simulation of closed and open quantum systems, described by a Schrödinger equation. On one hand, we show that a closed quantum system is defined by local boundary conditions. On the other hand, we argue that, because of the uncertainty principle, no local boundary condition can be defined for open quantum systems. For this reason plane waves or wave packet trains cannot be simulated on a finite numerical lattice with the usual procedures. We suggest a method that avoids these difficulties by using only a small numerical lattice and maintains the correspondence with the physical picture, in which the incident and scattered waves may be infinitely extended.

Motivation: The paper likely aimed to provide a thorough understanding of non-Hermiticity in open quantum systems and to develop tools for analyzing systems with strong couplings to their environments, which is valuable for both foundational research and practical applications in quantum physics.

Method: The paper likely uses rigorous mathematical approaches, including scattering theory, resonant state definitions under specific boundary conditions, and the Feshbach formalism to eliminate infinite environmental degrees of freedom. It constructs a new complete set of bases by unifying different methods.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing and solving problems in open quantum systems with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, providing a new complete set of bases that includes resonant states. It also highlights the importance of non-Markovian dynamics and time-reversal symmetry in these systems.

Conclusion: The paper contributes significantly to the understanding of non-Hermiticity in open quantum systems and offers new analytical tools for studying such systems with strong system-environment couplings. It underscores the importance of considering non-Markovian dynamics in future research on open quantum systems.

Abstract: We review analyses of open quantum systems. We show how non-Hermiticity arises in an open quantum system with an infinite environment, focusing on the one-body problem. One of the reasons for taking the present approach is that we can solve the problem completely, making it easier to see the structures of problems involving open quantum systems. We show that this results in the discovery of a new complete set, which is one of the main topics of the present article. Another reason for focusing on the one-body problem is that the theory permits the strong coupling between the system and the environment. In the current research landscape, it is valuable to revisit the one-body problem for open quantum systems, which can be solved accurately for arbitrary strengths of the system-environment couplings. A rigorous understanding of the problem structures in the present approach will be helpful when we tackle problems with many-body interactions. First, we consider potential scattering and directly define the resonant state as an eigenstate of the Schrödinger equation under the Siegert outgoing boundary condition. We show that the resonant eigenstate can have a complex energy eigenvalue, even though the Hamiltonian is seemingly Hermitian. Second, we introduce the Feshbach formalism, which eliminates the infinite degrees of freedom of the environment and represents its effect as a complex potential. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is explicitly non-Hermitian. By unifying these two ways of defining resonant states, we obtain a new complete set of bases for the scattering problem that contains all discrete eigenstates, including resonant states. We finally mention the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. We emphasize the time-reversal symmetry of the dynamics that continuously connects the past and the future. We can capture it using the new complete set that we develop here.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of the charger-mediated quantum battery modeled by a two-qubit system. One of the qubits acts as the battery and the other acts as the charger which is subjected to a reservoir. We derived the time-local master equation in Lindblad form with a time-dependent dephasing rate. The dephasing rate may be negative in the early-stage of the charging process and thus indicate the presence of the memory effect. We find that such early-stage memory effect could increase the maximal ergotropy of the battery compared with the one under Markovian approximation with the corresponding asymptotic dephase rate. The enhancement of the performance is explained by means of the non-Markovian quantum jumps. Moreover, a discrete time scheme of the measurement-enhanced quantum battery is proposed in a quantum circuit with global and random local operations.

Abstract: This work extends previous results on the inverse scattering problem within the framework of Marchenko theory (fixed-$l$ inversion). In particular, I approximate an $n$-channel $S$-matrix as a function of the first-channel momentum $q$ by a sum of a rational term and a truncated sinc series for each matrix element. Relativistic kinematics are taken into account through the correct momentum-energy relation, and the necessary minor generalization of Marchenko theory is given.
  For energies where only a subset of scattering channels is open, the analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is analyzed. I demonstrate that the submatrix corresponding to closed channels, particularly near their thresholds, can be reconstructed from the experimentally accessible submatrix of open channels.The convergence of the proposed method is verified by applying it to data generated from a direct solution of the scattering problem for a known potential, and comparing the reconstructed potential with the original one. Finally, the method is applied to the analysis of $S_{31}$ $πN$ scattering data.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cryogenic analog signal processing architecture designed for superconducting qubit control and quantum state readout operating at 4 Kelvin. The proposed system implements a complete bidirectional signal path bridging room-temperature digital controllers with quantum processors at millikelvin stages. The control path incorporates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for stable local oscillator generation, In-phase/Quadrature (I/Q) modulation for precise qubit gate operations, and a cryogenic power amplifier for signal conditioning. The readout path features a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with 14 dB gain and 8-Phase Shift Keying (8-PSK) demodulation for quantum state discrimination. All circuit blocks are designed and validated through SPICE simulations employing cryogenic MOSFET models at 180nm that account for carrier freeze-out, threshold voltage elevation, and enhanced mobility at 4 K. Simulation results demonstrate successful end-to-end signal integrity with I/Q phase error below 2°, image rejection ratio exceeding 35~dB, and symbol error rate below $10^{-6}$. This work provides a modular, simulation-validated framework for scalable cryogenic quantum control systems.

Abstract: We show that, for any physically realizable Mueller transformation -- including arbitrarily depolarizing maps -- the interferometric (Pancharatnam) geometric phase is fixed uniquely by the SO(3) rotation associated with the unitary (retarding) part of the pure characteristic component selected by the characteristic decomposition. All remaining characteristic contributions (discriminant and maximally mixed) can only reduce fringe visibility; they never generate geometric holonomy, even if their pure constituents involve rotations. We further establish the quantum analogue for open two-level dynamics: in the Choi representation of qubit channels, the geometric phase is fixed by the coherent unitary part of the dominant rank-one characteristic component, while the remaining dissipative structure affects visibility only.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes offer a promising route to scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) due to their substantially reduced footprint, but these gains can be diluted at utility scale if we cannot also realize a space-time-efficient instruction-set architecture (ISA) for relevant quantum applications. We present RASCqL, a Reaction-time-limited Architecture for Space-time-efficient Complex qLDPC Logic, introducing a complex-instruction-set quantum computer (CISQ) that supports key algorithmic subroutines such as quantum arithmetic, table lookups, and magic-state distillation directly in co-designed qLDPC codes.
  Unlike prior constructions for qLDPC logic that aim at versatile ISAs amenable to diverse circuits, RASCqL adopts an application-tailored code-modification scheme that embeds specific complex Clifford instructions useful for functional subroutines as virtually implementable matrix automorphisms. RASCqL further leverages parallel physical operations in reconfigurable neutral-atom array platforms to achieve fast QEC cycles and high-fidelity transversal operations. At the cost of increased design complexity, RASCqL implements key algorithmic subroutines at space-time costs comparable to state-of-the-art transversal surface-code architectures while achieving up to $2\times$ to $7\times$ footprint reduction under realistic physical error rates of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ to $5 \times 10^{-4}$, without additional hardware complexity. RASCqL thus demonstrates a concrete path forward for qLDPC codes as CISQ compute modules, extending their practical utility in fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is an interesting resource for modern quantum technologies, where generating multiple quantum entanglement is highly required. However, entanglement engineering between multiple modes is strongly suppressed by dark mode effect. Here, we proposed a scheme based on molecular cavity optomechanical structure that enhances quantum bipartite and tripartite entanglement via dark mode breaking. Our proposal consists of an optical cavity that hosts two molecular ensembles which are coupled through an intermolecular coupling. A vibrational hopping rate $J_m$ captures the intermolecular coupling that is phase modulated via the synthetic gauge field method. The breaking of the dark mode is controlled by tuning both the intermolecular coupling and its modulation phase. By adjusting these parameters in our proposal, we can flexibly switch between the Dark Mode Unbroken (DMU) and the Dark Mode Broken (DMB) regimes. We find that in the dark-mode-unbroken regime, the amount of the generated bipartite and tripartite entanglement is significantly low or is suppressed. In contrast, in the dark-mode-broken regime, the entanglement is greatly enhanced,i.e., up to twofold enhancement. Moreover, the generated entanglement is more resilient against thermal noise in the dark-mode-broken regime compared to the thermal robustness in the unbroken regime. Therefore, our proposed scheme serves as a benckmark system to improve quantum correlations engineering, and to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources for applications in numerous modern quantum technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the challenges in achieving optimal performance with Variational Quantum Algorithms, particularly QAOA, on near-term quantum devices.

Method: The method involves introducing a scalable, application-agnostic initialization framework that employs a relaxed QAOA ansatz, enabling classical search over Clifford-preparable quantum states.

Result: The framework achieves an 80% improvement in absolute accuracy and significantly reduces initial-state diversity by up to 10,000x across various combinatorial optimization problems.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the effectiveness of QAOA by providing high-quality initial states, thereby reducing the number of quantum circuit evaluations and lowering the cost associated with solving complex optimization problems.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), offer a promising route to tackling combinatorial optimization problems on near and intermediate-term quantum devices. However, their performance critically depends on the choice of initial parameters, and the limited expressiveness of the QAOA ansatz makes identifying effective initializations both difficult and unscalable. To address this, we propose a framework, Scalable Parameter Initialization for QAOA (SPIQ), that employs a relaxed QAOA ansatz to enable classical search over a set of Clifford-preparable quantum states that yield high-quality solutions. These states serve as superior QAOA initializations, driving rapid convergence while significantly reducing the quantum circuit evaluations needed to reach high-quality solutions and consequently lowering quantum-device cost. We present a scalable, application-agnostic initialization framework that achieves an absolute accuracy improvement of up to 80% over state-of-the-art initialization and reduces initial-state diversity by up to 10,000x across QUBO, PUBO, and PCBO problems spanning tens to hundreds of qubits. We further benchmark its performance on a wide range of problem formulations and instances derived from real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent and scalable improvements. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies for selecting high-quality Clifford points identified by our search procedure and using them to seed multi-start optimization, thereby enhancing exploration and improving solution quality.

Abstract: Scalable, high-fidelity quantum-state readout remains a central challenge in the development of large-scale superconducting quantum processors. Conventional dispersive readout architectures depend on bulky isolators and external amplifiers, introducing significant hardware overhead and limiting opportunities for on-chip information processing. In this work, we propose a novel approach that embeds a nonlinear Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) into the readout chain, enabling coherent and directional processing of readout signals directly on-chip. This embedded SNAIL platform allows frequency-multiplexed resonators to interact through engineered couplings, forming a tunable readout-amplifier-output architecture that can manipulate quantum readout data \textit{in situ}. Through theoretical modeling and numerical optimization, we show that this platform enhances fidelity, suppresses measurement-induced decoherence, and simplifies hardware complexity. These results establish the hybridized SNAIL as a promising building block for scalable and coherent quantum-state readout in next-generation processors.

Abstract: The local Hamiltonian (LH) problem is the canonical $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problem introduced by Kitaev. In this paper, we show its hardness in a very strong sense: we show that the 3-local Hamiltonian problem on $n$ qubits cannot be solved classically in time $O(2^{(1-\varepsilon)n})$ for any $\varepsilon>0$ under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH), and cannot be solved quantumly in time $O(2^{(1-\varepsilon)n/2})$ for any $\varepsilon>0$ under the Quantum Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (QSETH). These lower bounds give evidence that the currently known classical and quantum algorithms for LH cannot be significantly improved.
  Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate fine-grained complexity lower bounds for approximating the quantum partition function (QPF) with an arbitrary constant relative error. Approximating QPF with relative error is known to be equivalent to approximately counting the dimension of the solution subspace of $\mathsf{QMA}$ problems. We show the SETH and QSETH hardness to estimate QPF with constant relative error. We then provide a quantum algorithm that runs in $O(\sqrt{2^n})$ time for an arbitrary $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ relative error, matching our lower bounds and improving the state-of-the-art algorithm by Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset, and Wocjan (Nature Physics 2022) in the low-temperature regime.
  To prove our fine-grained lower bounds, we introduce the first size-preserving circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction that encodes the computation of a $T$-time quantum circuit acting on $N$ qubits into a $(d+1)$-local Hamiltonian acting on $N+O(T^{1/d})$ qubits. This improves the standard construction based on the unary clock, which uses $N+O(T)$ qubits.

Abstract: Networked quantum sensors have several applications such as the mapping of magnetic fields. When the magnetic fields are biomagnetic ones, i.e., they contain some private information, the information of from who non-zero magnetic fields occur has to be protected from eavesdroppers. Anonymous quantum sensing keeps it secret by estimating amplitudes of the magnetic fields without disclosing the positions of non-zero magnetic fields. In this paper, we propose an anonymous quantum sensing protocol that is robust against any independent noise in state preparations. To this end, we devise a quantum state verification protocol for a superposition of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states and combine it with the original protocol of anonymous quantum sensing. Our verification protocol can decide whether the fidelity between the ideal and actual states is high or low more efficiently than the direct fidelity estimation. Since the original protocol of anonymous quantum sensing cannot correctly estimate the amplitudes of the magnetic fields under state preparation errors, our results would improve the performance of anonymous quantum sensing in realistic situations.

Abstract: We present a dispersive quantum thermometry protocol for simultaneous estimation of inverse temperature $β$ and interaction strength $x$ using a nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometer coupled to a thermal ancilla. We derive closed-form expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix, establishing that metrological performance depends solely on the thermal visibility $\mathcal{V}(β)$ and its derivative. The output state remains diagonal in photon-number basis, making photon counting globally optimal and saturating the multiparameter quantum Cramér-Rao bound without adaptive feedback. Moving beyond ideal unitary evolution, we analyze protocol robustness under concurrent amplitude and phase damping. Using Fisher Information Susceptibility, we establish a clear hierarchy: NOON states offer maximal theoretical sensitivity but exhibit exponential fragility to loss, rendering them impractical. Squeezed vacuum states emerge as robust candidates for steady-state sensing, while cat states prove compelling for transient thermometry by retaining significant coherence after photon loss. We validate these predictions through digital quantum circuit implementation on IBM's \texttt{ibm_torino} processor. Experimental results confirm the predicted Fisher information landscape while revealing systematic noise-induced biases, demonstrating that current NISQ hardware can effectively benchmark fundamental trade-offs in multiparameter quantum sensing.

Abstract: The establishment of extremely strong bounds on the magnitude of the electric dipole moment of the neutron, a quantity that is of great importance for determining the level of time reversal symmetry respected by the strong interactions, offers an important lesson regarding the manner in which quantum uncertainties are interpreted in the inflationary cosmological account of the generation of the primordial inhomogeneities that give rise to the universe's structure. The identification of quantum uncertainties with actual stochastic fluctuations, a standard aspect of the current physical account for the emergence of the cosmic structure, is called into question. This opens the door for novel aspects of physics that are needed in order to provide a satisfactory account that is both conceptually clear and does not conflict with the use of quantum theory in other settings.

*Partha Ghose*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Classically describable fundamental optical phenomena provide a testbed for implementing Bell-CHSH correlations and operational contextuality in an ideally classical / nonquantum setting, suggesting realizable pathways to understanding quantum nonlocality, even in a fundamentally classical mechanical domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's exploration of classical polarization optics as a potential framework for implementing Bell-CHSH correlations and demonstrating nonlocal contextuality in a classical setting raises questions about the nature of these phenomena and their implications for broader theories of physics and information.

Method: The paper employs a categorical approach, specifically within the theoretical framework of operational process theory (e.g., CPM(FHilb)). It details a 'preparation-and-conditioning pipeline' modeled after quantum computing elements (Hadamard gates, CNOTs, and routing/conditioning circuits), and derives an empirical model through a sheaf-theoretic method by Abramsky and Brandenburger. The analysis considers the separation between kinematic nonseparability and operational contextuality.

Result: The study demonstrates that classical optical systems can exhibit Bell-CHSH correlations and operational contextuality, which are typically associated with quantum mechanics. This suggests that realizable physical systems can simulate the phenomena usually attributed to quantum nonlocality.

Conclusion: This work opens up the possibility of exploring quantum-like phenomena within fundamentally classical domains, such as large-scale classical wave systems or engineered optical media, potentially contributing to both quantum and classical information processing theories.

Abstract: Classical polarization optics is naturally described by a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space (Jones vectors), so the tensor-product kinematics underlying bipartite nonseparability is already available classically. For statistical (stochastic) optical fields, and under an operational stance where outcomes are not assumed pre-assigned prior to detection, suitably prepared two-beam polarization states can exhibit Bell--CHSH correlations of quantum strength. The same platform offers a tunable, low-cost testbed for stress-testing Bell/CHSH and contextuality witnesses under realistic imperfections (noise, coarse binning, selective sampling). We also outline an alternative preparation based on external conical refraction (ECR), where engineered intersecting conical-refraction rings mimic the intersecting emission cones of SPDC. We give a self-contained categorical formulation: the preparation-and-conditioning pipeline (Hadamard-like splitting, CNOT-like coupling, and routing/conditioning that removes unwanted contributions) is treated as a single morphism in an operational process theory (e.g. $\mathbf{CPM}(\mathbf{FHilb})$). From it we functorially extract an empirical model, i.e. a compatible family of context-indexed probability distributions. The Abramsky--Brandenburger sheaf criterion then applies: noncontextuality is the existence of a global section, and CHSH violation is a precise failure-to-glue. This separates kinematic nonseparability from operational contextuality and clarifies why neither, by itself, entails nonlocal causation; contextuality can arise in a classically implementable stochastic-optics regime.

Abstract: Solving coupled systems of differential equations (DEs) is a central problem across scientific computing. While Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a promising, mesh-free approach, their standard architectures struggle with the multi-objective optimization conflicts and local optima traps inherent in coupled problems. To address the first issue, we propose a Forked PINN (FPINN) framework designed for coupled systems of DEs. FPINN employs a shared base network with independent branches, isolating gradient pathways to stabilize training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FPINN in simulating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics governed by coupled DEs, where multi-objective conflicts and local optima traps often cause evolutionary stagnation. To overcome this second challenge, we incorporate an evolution regularization loss that guides the model away from trivial solutions and ensures physically meaningful evolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FPINN in simulating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics governed by coupled DEs, where multi-objective conflicts and local optima traps often cause evolutionary stagnation. For the spin-boson and XXZ models, FPINN accurately captures hallmark non-Markovian features, such as quantum coherence revival and information backflow, significantly outperforming standard PINNs. The proposed FPINN architecture offers a general and effective framework for solving coupled systems of equations, which arise across a broad spectrum from classical physics to modern artificial intelligence, including applications in multi-body rotational dynamics, multi-asset portfolio optimization, chemical reaction kinetics, and deep representation learning.

Conclusion: SIQHDy提供了一种高效的方法来识别量子哈密顿量，适用于有部分可观测情况的扩展方案。

Abstract: Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) is a data-driven framework for estimating classical nonlinear dynamical systems from time-series data. In this approach, system dynamics is represented as a linear combination of a predefined set of basis functions, and the corresponding coefficients are sparsely estimated from observed time-series data. In this study, we propose sparse identification of quantum Hamiltonian dynamics (SIQHDy), a SINDy-inspired quantum circuit learning framework for estimating quantum Hamiltonian dynamics from time-series data of quantum measurement outcomes. In SIQHDy, the unitary evolution of a quantum Hamiltonian system is expressed as a product of basis quantum circuits, and the corresponding circuit parameters are estimated through sparsity-promoting optimization. We numerically demonstrate that SIQHDy accurately reconstructs the dynamics of single-, three-, and five-spin systems, and exhibits robustness to measurement noise in the three-spin case. Furthermore, we propose an extension of SIQHDy for scenarios with limited accessible observables and evaluate its performance in identifying two-spin systems and in network-structure identification for five-spin systems.

Motivation:  Machining PINNs with quantum embedding enhances their representational power for future quantum applications.

Method: Two quantum PINN structures: FNN-TE-QPINN and QNN-TE-QPINN, using classical and quantum embedding respectively.

Result: Hybrid approaches yielded better accuracy on heat equations than classical PINNs alone.

Conclusion: Quantum PINNs promise enhanced accuracy for NISQ era modeling through hybrid classical-quantum strategies.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding governing physical laws directly into the training objective. Recent advances in quantum machine learning have motivated hybrid quantum-classical extensions aimed at enhancing representational capacity while remaining compatible with near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we investigate trainable embedding strategies within quantum-assisted PINNs for solving parabolic PDEs, using one- and two-dimensional heat equations as canonical benchmarks. We introduce two quantum-assisted architectures that differ in their embedding components. In the first approach, a classical feed-forward neural network generates trainable feature maps for quantum data encoding (FNN-TE-QPINN). In the second, the embedding stage is realized entirely by a parameterized quantum circuit (QNN-TE-QPINN), yielding a fully quantum feature map. Our findings emphasize the critical role of embedding design and support hybrid quantum-classical approaches for parabolic PDE modeling in the NISQ era.

TL;DR: The study highlights the need to incorporate spin-spin dipolar interactions in low-temperature spin dynamics using the gCCE method but finds it insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spin decoherence across temperatures is crucial for quantum computing.

Method: Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE) and its extension, gCCE, are used to study low-temperature spin dynamics.

Result: gCCE in its current form is insufficient for accurately describing spin-spin relaxation.

Conclusion: Future work is needed to improve the gCCE framework for better modeling of spin relaxation.

Abstract: The study of spin decoherence is often performed by assuming that spin-phonon interactions lead to relaxation at high temperatures, and spin-spin dipolar interactions instead contribute to pure dephasing at low temperatures. This has resulted in the neglect of spin relaxation due to spin-spin dipolar interactions and its influence on decoherence at low temperatures. For a complete understanding of low temperature spin dynamics, it is then imperative to focus also on the latter mechanism. One such method which has shown great promise in the efficient calculation of central spin dynamics due to spin-spin dipolar interactions with a surrounding spin bath is the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE). An extension of this method through the explicit inclusion of the central spin degrees of freedom, known as the generalized Cluster-Correlation Expansion (gCCE) is capable of simulating the transfer of energy from the central spin into the bath, and thus could have the potential to investigate spin relaxation in this setting. In this work, we show that gCCE, in its standard form, is insufficient for providing even a qualitatively accurate description of spin-spin relaxation. A full mathematical deconstruction of the underlying theory of gCCE clearly points to the origin of such a breakdown and provides a starting point for its potential future resolution.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Biomarker-based clinical outcome prediction is difficult because of nonlinear relationships, correlated features, and small datasets. Classical machine learning methods sometimes struggle, so we explore quantum reservoir computing (QRC). We use both simulations and actual quantum hardware to evaluate QRC. Our results show that QRC models can achieve similar accuracy to classical methods when trained on simulated features, but they overfit more. However, when tested on actual quantum hardware, QRC shows better consistency and more accurate results compared to classical methods. This suggests that using quantum hardware might improve the performance and reliability of predictions by reducing overfitting and introducing a regularization effect. We further analyze the features produced by quantum hardware and find that the hardware introduces a specific kind of transformation that makes the data more structured and reduces some of the noise present in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the limitations of classical machine learning methods in predicting clinical outcomes, which are often complicated by nonlinear relationships, correlated features, and small dataset sizes. By exploring alternative approaches such as quantum reservoir computing, the researchers aim to develop more accurate and reliable prediction models.

Method: The method used in this study involves two stages: (1) using classical machine learning models to analyze both simulated (noiseless emulation) and actual quantum hardware data, and (2) employing SHAP ( SHapley Additive exPlanations) to evaluate feature subsets. The comparison between the performance of models trained on different data sources helps in understanding the advantages of quantum computing in this context.

Result: The key findings from this study are: 1) Classical machine learning models sometimes struggle with nonlinear relationships and feature correlations in clinical data, and 2) Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) shows promise in addressing these challenges. Specifically, models trained with quantum features via noiseless emulation achieve comparable accuracy to classical models but show signs of overfitting. However, when executed on actual quantum hardware, QRC models demonstrate better generalization and statistical significance in their test accuracy compared to classical models. This suggests hardware execution of QRC may introduce a form of regularization that simulated data lacks.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper highlights the potential of quantum reservoir computing as a tool for improving biomarker-based clinical outcome predictions. While simulations show that QRC models can mimic classical methods' performance, the hardware execution offers better consistency and higher accuracy. This suggests that real-world quantum hardware may be more effective in clinical applications, possibly due to factors like reduced overfitting or inherent regularization effects from the quantum processing.

Abstract: Biomarker-based prediction of clinical outcomes is challenging due to nonlinear relationships, correlated features, and the limited size of many medical datasets. Classical machine-learning methods can struggle under these conditions, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC), using both noiseless emulation and hardware execution on the neutral-atom Rydberg processor \textit{Aquila}. We evaluate performance with six classical machine-learning models and use SHAP to generate feature subsets. We find that models trained on emulated quantum features achieve mean test accuracies comparable to those trained on classical features, but have higher training accuracies and greater variability over data splits, consistent with overfitting. When comparing hardware execution of QRC to noiseless emulation, the models are more robust over different data splits and often exhibit statistically significant improvements in mean test accuracy. This combination of improved accuracy and increased stability is suggestive of a regularising effect induced by hardware execution. To investigate the origin of this behaviour, we examine the statistical differences between hardware and emulated quantum feature distributions. We find that hardware execution applies a structured, time-dependent transformation characterised by compression toward the mean and a progressive reduction in mutual information relative to emulation.

Abstract: This paper presents an introduction to geometric representations of quantum states in which each distinct quantum state, pure and mixed, corresponds to a unique point in a Euclidean space. Beginning with a review of some underappreciated properties of the most commonly used geometric representation, the Bloch sphere visualization of qubit states, we show how concepts, algorithms, and spatial relations viewable on this geometric representation can be extended to representations of qudit states of any finite quantum dimension $d$ and on to the infinite-dimensional limit. A primary goal of the work is helping the reader develop a visual intuition of these spaces, which can complement the understanding of the algebraic formalism of quantum mechanics for learners, teachers, and researchers at any level. Particular emphasis is given both to understanding states in a basis-independent way and to understanding how probability amplitudes and density matrix elements used to algebraically represent states in a particular basis correspond to line segments and angles in the geometric representations. In addition to providing visualizations for such concepts as superpositions, mixtures, decoherence, and measurement, we demonstrate how the representations can be used to substitute simple geometrical calculations for more cumbersome linear algebra ones, which may be of particular use in introducing mixed states and density matrices to beginning quantum students at an early stage. The work concludes with the geometrical interpretation of some commonly used metrics such as the purity of states and their relation to real, Euclidean vectors in the infinite-dimensional limit of the space, which contains all lower-dimensional qudit spaces as subspaces.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The optimal measurement operator for quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) can be trained optimally using a method inspired by kernel ridge regression, improving efficiency and practicality by adapting to hardware constraints through Pauli basis decomposition and operator diagonalization. This approach has been validated through numerical experiments in image classification and time series prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum machine learning models, like quantum reservoir computers, hold promise for future advancements in quantum computing, particularly in areas such as image classification and time series prediction. However, the practical implementation of these models heavily depends on the optimal measurement operators used, which are often challenging to design and train. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing an efficient method for training optimal measurement operators inspired by kernel ridge regression, making use of quantum feature maps and hardware constraints.

Method: The paper formulates the training of quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) in the framework of kernel ridge regression, enabling the determination of optimal measurement operators that minimize prediction error. For large qubit numbers, this approach is more efficient than conventional training methods. The authors employ techniques such as Pauli basis decomposition and operator diagonalization to adapt the optimal measurement operators to hardware constraints, ensuring practical implementability.

Result: Numerical experiments conducted in the paper demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the performance of quantum reservoir computers in image classification and time series prediction tasks. The results also suggest that this approach can be generalized to other quantum machine learning models, potentially broadening its applicability in the field of quantum computing.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel and efficient method for training optimal measurement operators for quantum reservoir computers, significantly enhancing their performance and practicality. By leveraging kernel ridge regression and accounting for hardware constraints, the approach not only improves efficiency but also validates its effectiveness through diverse numerical experiments, paving the way for further advancements in quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Finding optimal measurement operators is crucial for the performance of quantum reservoir computers (QRCs), since they employ a fixed quantum feature map. We formulate the training of both stateless (quantum extreme learning machines, QELMs) and stateful (memory dependent) QRCs in the framework of kernel ridge regression. This approach renders an optimal measurement operator that minimizes prediction error for a given reservoir and training dataset. For large qubit numbers, this method is more efficient than the conventional training of QRCs. We discuss efficiency and practical implementation strategies, including Pauli basis decomposition and operator diagonalization, to adapt the optimal observable to hardware constraints. Numerical experiments on image classification and time series prediction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, which can also be applied to other quantum ML models.

Abstract: Compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is crucial for the realistic implementation of quantum cryptographic protocols. We investigate a cryptographic scheme based on discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on cyclic graphs that exploits Parrondo dynamics, wherein periodic evolution emerges from a deterministic sequence of individually chaotic coin operators. We construct an explicit quantum circuit realization tailored to NISQ architectures and analyze its performance through numerical simulations in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy conditions. Protocol performance is quantified using probability distributions, Hellinger fidelity, and total variation distance. To assess security at the circuit level, we model intercept-resend and man-in-the-middle attacks and evaluate the resulting quantum bit error rate. In the absence of adversarial intervention, the protocol enables reliable message recovery, whereas eavesdropping induces characteristic disturbances that disrupt the periodic reconstruction mechanism. We further examine hardware feasibility on contemporary NISQ processors, specifically $ibm\_torino$, incorporating qubit connectivity and state-transfer constraints into the circuit design. Our analysis demonstrates that communication between spatially separated logical modules increases circuit depth via SWAP operations, leading to cumulative noise effects. By exploring hybrid state-transfer strategies, we show that qubit selection and connectivity play a decisive role in determining fidelity and overall protocol performance, highlighting hardware-dependent trade-offs in NISQ implementations.

Abstract: Multiparameter quantum metrology plays a fundamental role in uncovering and exploiting the distinctive features of quantum systems. In this work, we propose an effective and experimentally feasible scheme to significantly enhance the simultaneous quantum estimation of the photon magnon and magnon mechanical coupling strengths in a hybrid cavity magnon mechanical platform. Our approach relies on the assistance of a coherent feedback loop combined with the injection of a coherent driving field. We show that an appropriate tuning of the system and feedback parameters leads to a substantial reduction of the estimation errors associated with both coupling strengths. To quantify the metrological performance of the proposed scheme, we employ the quantum Cramer Rao bound (QCRB) as a fundamental benchmark for multiparameter estimation. We explicitly compute and compare the QCRBs derived from the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) formalisms. Our results demonstrate that the RLD based QCRB is systematically lower than the SLD based bound, indicating superior estimation precision in the considered noncommutative estimation scenario. We further analyze the performance of heterodyne detection and show that, in suitable parameter regimes, the corresponding classical estimation precision closely approaches the ultimate quantum limit predicted by our scheme. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed setup within currently available cavity magnon mechanical platforms. Owing to its general character, the framework developed here can be readily extended to the high precision estimation of other physical parameters in hybrid quantum systems.

TL;DR: Randomized shadow tomography considerably expedites Lindblad tomography for quantum processor characterization without sacrificing precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating decoherence and noise in quantum processors is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Efficient characterization methods are vital due to the exponential resources required by conventional tomography.

Method: We developed a randomized ('shadow') measurements method to accelerate Lindblad tomography. The proposed approach assumes local Lindblad parameters, requiring far fewer measurements than full tomography while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Our shadow tomography method enabled characterization of a five-qubit superconducting transmon processor in 9 hours, compared to the projected 58 hours for conventional methods.

Conclusion: Randomized shadow tomography represents a practical, high-accuracy method for quantum processor dynamics characterization, scalability enhancing its applicability in larger quantum systems.

Abstract: Spurious couplings and decoherence degrade the performance of solid-state quantum processors, demanding careful design, calibration, and mitigation protocols. These strategies often rely on characterization of the idling processor, but tomographic recovery of (time-independent) Lindblad dynamics scales exponentially with qubit count. Here, we experimentally benchmark and demonstrate that randomized ("shadow") measurements accelerate Lindblad tomography on a superconducting transmon processor. We first implement extensible Lindblad tomography, which estimates Lindblad parameters using a complete tomographic dataset, and use it as a baseline to benchmark a shadow tomography approach, shadow Lindblad tomography. The shadow approach recycles randomized configurations to estimate the same Lindblad parameters using far fewer resources under physically motivated locality assumptions. We experimentally verify these assumptions in our processor by implementing the protocols on one- and three-qubit subsystems; here, shadow Lindblad tomography reproduces extensible Lindblad tomography within uncertainties while using exponentially fewer configurations. Leveraging this efficiency, we apply shadow Lindblad tomography to the full five-qubit processor and recover all single qubit dissipation and two-qubit coupling parameters in 9 hours of acquisition time compared to an estimated 58 hours for extensible Lindblad tomography. Additionally, our shadow implementation is compatible with conventional Gaussian error propagation, avoiding the use of median-of-means estimators. Together, these results demonstrate how randomized shadow tomography protocols can be practically implemented to learn quantum processor dynamics at an increasing qubit count.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with globally reciprocal couplings -- such as the Hatano-Nelson model with stochastic imaginary gauge fields -- avoid the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, displaying erratic bulk localization while retaining ballistic transport. An open question is whether similar behavior arises when non-reciprocity originates at the Liouvillian level rather than from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained via post-selection. Here we investigate this scenario in a lattice model with globally reciprocal Liouvillian dynamics and locally asymmetric incoherent hopping, a disordered setting in which Liouvillian-specific effects have remained largely unexplored. While the steady state again shows disorder-dependent, erratic localization without boundary accumulation, we find that global reciprocity in the Liouvillian does not protect transport. Instead, in the regime dominated by incoherent hopping, excitations spread via Sinai-type subdiffusion, dramatically slower than the ordinary diffusion found in symmetric stochastic lattices. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between globally reciprocal Hamiltonian and Liouvillian dynamics: global reciprocity suppresses the skin effect in both cases, but only in Liouvillian dynamics can it coexist with ultra-slow, disorder-induced subdiffusive transport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving decoding efficiency for quantum error-correcting codes to enhance quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical decoder that operates in polynomial time and achieves optimal decoding at lower levels. The decoder leverages the structural properties of the underlying graph states and the well-defined structure of the projective syndrome measurement.

Result: The proposed approach shows higher efficiency and effectiveness than full maximum-likelihood decoding, as demonstrated by numerical simulations.

Conclusion: This advance offers a promising method for decoding graph codes, promising to significantly enhance practical quantum error correction schemes, particularly in large-scale quantum computing systems where resource efficiency is crucial.

Abstract: In this work, we develop an efficient decoding method for graph codes, a class of stabilizer quantum error-correcting codes constructed from graph states. While optimal decoding is generally NP-hard, we propose a faster decoder exploiting the structural properties of the underlying graph states. Although distinct error patterns may yield the same syndrome, we demonstrate that the post-measurement state follows a well-defined structure determined by the projective syndrome measurement. Building on this idea, we introduce a hierarchical decoder in which each level can be solved in polynomial time. Additionally, this decoder achieves optimal decoding performance at the lower levels of the hierarchy. This strategy avoids the need for full maximum-likelihood decoding of graph codes. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: We derive simple and unified closed-form expressions for projections with respect to fidelity (equivalently, the Bures and purified distances) onto several sets of interest. These include projections of bipartite positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices onto the set of PSD matrices with a given marginal, and projections of ensembles of PSD matrices onto the set of PSD decompositions of a given matrix, with important special cases corresponding to projections onto the set of quantum channels (via the Choi isomorphism) and onto the set of measurements. We introduce prior-channel decompositions of completely positive (CP) maps, which uniquely decompose any CP map into a prior PSD matrix and a quantum channel. This decomposition generalizes the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism by establishing a bijective correspondence between arbitrary bipartite PSD matrices and channel-state pairs, and we show that it arises naturally from the fidelity projections developed here. As applications, we show that the pretty good measurement - associated with a weighted ensemble - is the fidelity projection of the ensemble onto the set of measurements, and that the Petz recovery map - associated with a reference state and forward channel - is the projection of a CP map (constructed from the channel-state pair) onto the set of reverse quantum channels, thereby recasting the well-known identification of the Petz map with quantum Bayes' rule in information-geometric terms. Our results also provide an information-geometric underpinning of the Leifer-Spekkens quantum state over time formalism [Leifer and Spekkens, Phys. Rev. A 88, 052130 (2013)].

Abstract: The performance of quantum classifiers is typically analyzed through global state distinguishability or the trainability of variational models. This study investigates how much class information remains accessible under locality-constrained measurements in the presence of noise. The authors formulate binary quantum classification as constrained quantum state discrimination and introduce a locality-restricted distinguishability measure quantifying the maximum bias achievable by observables acting on at most $k$ subsystems. For $n$-qubit systems subject to independent depolarizing noise, the locally accessible signal is governed by a Pauli-weight-dependent contraction mechanism. This motivates a computable predictor, the $k$-local Pauli-accessible amplitude $A_{k}(p)$, which lower bounds the optimal $k$-local classification advantage. Numerical experiments on four-qubit encodings demonstrate quantitative agreement between empirical accuracy and the prediction across noise levels. The research identifies an operational breakdown threshold where $k$-local classifiers become indistinguishable from random guessing despite persistent global distinguishability.

Motivation: Advances in quantum computing and nonlinear dynamics motivate the study of photonic quantum memristors.

Method: Experiments were conducted on a silicon nitride photonic integrated circuit with a room-temperature single-photon source utilizing a silicon-vacancy color center SiV$^-$ in a nanodiamond. The memristors were implemented using integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers with adaptive transfer functions based on photon detection events.

Result: The system exhibits non-Markovian input-output dynamics, including inter-memristor input-output hysteresis with larger form factors and self-intersecting loops, revealing bistability and topologically non-trivial memory dynamics. Numerical simulations support the observed phenomena.

Conclusion: The coupled memristors demonstrate scalable components for future quantum neuromorphic and reservoir computing architectures, expanding the scope of photonic quantum systems.

Abstract: Photonic quantum memristors provide a measurement-induced route to nonlinear and history-dependent quantum dynamics. Experimental demonstrations have so far focused on isolated devices or simple cascaded devices configurations. Here, we experimentally realize and characterize a network of two coupled photonic quantum memristors with crossed feedback, implemented on a silicon nitride photonic integrated circuit and fed by a room-temperature single-photon source based on a silicon-vacancy color center SiV$^-$ in a nanodiamond. Each memristor consists of an integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose transfer function is adaptively updated by photon detection events on another memristor, thus generating novel non-Markovian input-output dynamics with an enhanced memristive behaviour compared to single devices. In particular, we report inter-memristor input-output hysteresis curves exhibiting larger form factors and displaying self-intersecting loops, respectively revealing marked bistability and topologically non-trivial memory dynamics. Furthermore, numerical simulations show how these features emerge from the interplay between memory depth and relative input phase, for both intra- and inter-memristor input-output relations. Our results establish coupled integrated photonic quantum memristors as scalable nonlinear building blocks and highlight their potential for implementing compact quantum neuromorphic and reservoir computing architectures.

TL;DR: A probabilistic cutoff policy for quantum repeater chains improves end-to-end fidelity and secret-key rates under certain conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum repeater efficiency and fidelity is crucial for secure quantum communication networks.

Method: The study compares a probabilistic cutoff policy with a deterministic one by analyzing end-to-end fidelity, secret-key rates, and achievable rates.

Result: The probabilistic policy shows comparable performance to the deterministic one in chains with few nodes or high link generation probabilities. It also outperforms the deterministic policy when a minimum fidelity threshold is imposed.

Conclusion: Implementing a probabilistic cutoff policy can enhance quantum repeater performance without the need for tracking link ages, offering a practical trade-off between control and efficiency.

Abstract: We study quantum repeater chains in which entangled links between neighbouring nodes are created through heralded entanglement generation and adjacent links are swapped as soon as possible. Since heralded entanglement generation attempts succeed only probabilistically, some links will have to be stored in quantum memories at the nodes of the chain while waiting for adjacent links to be generated. The fidelity of these stored links decreases with time due to decoherence, and if they are stored for too long then this can lead to low end-to-end fidelity. Previous work has shown that the end-to-end fidelity can be improved by deterministically discarding links when their ages exceed some cutoff value. Such deterministic cutoff policies provide strict control of the fidelity of all links, but they come at the expense of having to track link ages. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic cutoff policy that does not require tracking link ages, at the cost of abandoning strict control of the fidelity. We benchmark this new probabilistic cutoff policy against a deterministic cutoff policy. We compare the policies in terms of the end-to-end rate and fidelity, and the secret-key rate. We find that even though the probabilistic cutoff policy keeps track of less state, it can provide secret-key rates of the same order of magnitude as the deterministic cutoff policy in chains with few nodes or high elementary link generation probabilities. Moreover, we identify a scenario in which the probabilistic cutoff policy can deliver end-to-end links that are required to have some minimum threshold fidelity at a higher rate than the deterministic cutoff policy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum states with sub-Planck features exhibit sensitivity to phase-space displacements beyond the standard quantum limit, making them useful for quantum metrology. In the context of the SU(1,1) group, sub-Planck features have been constructed through the superposition of four Perelomov coherent states on the hyperbolic plane (the SU(1,1) compass state). However, these structures differ in scale along different phase-space directions, resulting in nonuniform sensitivity enhancement. We overcome this limitation by constructing $\overline{n}$-component compass states, which are obtained by superposing $\overline{n} \geq 6$ SU(1,1) coherent states, with an even total number, evenly arranged along a circular path on the hyperbolic plane; that is, all components lie at the same distance from the origin and have equal angular spacing of $\frac{2π}{\overline{n}}$. These generalized SU(1,1) compass states generate circularly shaped sub-Planck features (isotropic sub-Planckness) and provide uniform enhancement in sensitivity to phase-space displacements. As the number of coherent states $\overline{n}$ increases, these refinements progressively improve. While verified for $\overline{n} = 16$ SU(1,1) coherent states, the results remain valid for superpositions with arbitrarily large $\overline{n}$ components.

We showcase the flexibility of our diabatic-adiabatic protocols through two examples in spin-based quantum information processing: state initialization and qubit state transfer.

Conclusion: 该研究通过几何和概率的方法，成功构建了与周期边界条件兼容的可扩展的局域化张量，为局域化和二聚化的实验探测提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: We revisit the localization tensor (LT) from geometric and probabilistic perspectives and construct extensions that are naturally compatible with periodic boundary conditions (PBC), without redefining the position operator. In open boundary conditions, we show that the LT can be written exactly as the covariance of a bivariate probability distribution built from density-density correlations. This leads to two conceptually distinct extensions to PBC: (i) a geometric one based on the Riemannian center (Frechet mean) on the circle, and (ii) a metric-free one based on the mutual information I, which treats the configuration space purely as a probability space. We then relate the LT to the static structure factor by identifying the diagonal part, Cpp, as a "localization function" C(p), whose small-momentum behavior determines the LT in the thermodynamic limit. This clarifies why the LT is sensitive to transitions out of the extended phase but by itself cannot distinguish Anderson-type localization from dimerization: both share the same low-momentum asymptotics. We show that the finite-momentum behavior of C(p), together with an inverse participation ratio (IPR)-based upper bound valid in localized phases, provides a sharp criterion that discriminates localization from dimerization. These results are illustrated on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Aubry-Andre models, with and without interactions, and suggest that structure factor-based probes offer robust and experimentally accessible diagnostics of localized and dimerized phases under PBC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on quantum computing in portfolio optimization, particularly under ESG and cardinality constraints, necessitates efficient algorithms to maintain portfolio relevance and performance.

Method: The authors propose a modified QAOA formulation using a Dicke state initialized XY-mixer Hamiltonian that enforces strict Hamming weight constraints. They address the 'Barren Plateau' issue by introducing a Trotterized parameter initialization schedule. This method is compared against Simulated Annealing and Hierarchical Risk Parity using a basket of 10 US equities over 2025.

Result: Our QAOA approach achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 1.81, significantly outperforming Simulated Annealing (1.31) and Hierarchical Risk Parity (0.98).

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the challenges of strict cardinality constraints and quantum computing for portfolio optimization, offering a superior and practical solution in institutional investment settings.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization under strict cardinality constraints is a combinatorial challenge that defies classical convex optimization techniques, particularly in the context of "Direct Indexing" and ESG-constrained mandates. In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) offers a promising hybrid approach. However, standard QAOA implementations utilizing transverse field mixers often fail to strictly enforce hard constraints, necessitating soft penalties that distort the energy landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a constraint-preserving QAOA formulation against Simulated Annealing (SA) and Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP). We implement a specific QAOA ansatz utilizing a Dicke state initialization and an XY-mixer Hamiltonian that strictly preserves the Hamming weight of the solution, ensuring only valid portfolios of size K are explored. Furthermore, we introduce a Trotterized parameter initialization schedule inspired by adiabatic quantum computing to mitigate the "Barren Plateau" problem. Backtesting on a basket of 10 US equities over 2025 reveals that our QAOA approach achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 1.81, significantly outperforming Simulated Annealing (1.31) and HRP (0.98). We further analyze the operational implications of the algorithm's high turnover (76.8%), discussing the trade-offs between theoretical optimality and implementation costs in institutional settings.

Abstract: We develop a comprehensive quantum estimation framework to quantify how precisely gravitationally induced decoherence can be inferred in optomechanical systems, using single-mode Gaussian probe states.

Abstract: We study the absorption time and spreading rate of the discrete-time quantum walk propagating on a line in the presence or absence of an absorber. We analytically establish that in the presence of an absorber, the average absorption time of the quantum walker is finite, contrary to the behavior of a classical random walker, indicating an infinite resource reduction on moving over to a quantum version of a walker. Furthermore, numerical simulations indicate a reversal of this behavior due to the insertion of disorder in the walker's step lengths. Additionally, we demonstrate that in the presence of an absorber, there is a speed-up in the spreading rate, and that a disordered quantum walk that is sub-ballistic regains the ballistic spreading of a clean quantum walk.

Conclusion: 本文为QAOA算法的优化提供了一种新的思路，通过学习和传递最优调度策略来提高算法的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices, yet its scalability is limited by the difficulty of optimizing \(2p\) variational parameters for a large number \(p\) of layers. Recent empirical studies indicate that optimal QAOA angles exhibit concentration and transferability across problem sizes. Leveraging this observation, we propose a schedule-learning framework that transfers spectral-gap-informed adiabatic control strategies from small-scale instances to larger systems.
  Our method extracts the spectral gap profile of small problems and constructs a continuous schedule governed by \(\partial_t s = κg^q(s)\), where \(g(s)\) is the instantaneous gap and \((κ, q)\) are global hyperparameters. Discretizing this schedule yields closed-form expressions for all QAOA angles, reducing the classical optimization task from \(2p\) parameters to only \(2\), independent of circuit depth. This drastic parameter compression mitigates classical optimization overhead and reduces sensitivity to barren plateau phenomena.
  Numerical simulations on random QUBO and 3-regular MaxCut instances demonstrate that the learnt schedules transfer effectively to larger systems while achieving competitive approximation ratios. Our results suggest that gap-informed schedule transfers provide a scalable and parameter-efficient strategy for QAOA.

Abstract: Programmability is increasingly central in emerging quantum network software stacks, yet the node-internal controller-to-hardware interface for quantum repeater devices remains under-specified. We introduce the idea of an instruction-set architecture (ISA) for controller-driven programmability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center quantum repeater nodes. Each node consists of an optically interfaced electron spin acting as a data qubit and a long-lived nuclear-spin register acting as a control program. We formalize two modes of programmability: (i) deterministic register control, where the nuclear register is initialized in a basis state to select a specific operation on the data qubit; and (ii) coherent register control, where the register is prepared in superposition, enabling coherent combinations of operations beyond classical programmability. Network protocols are expressed as controller-issued instruction vectors, which we illustrate through a compact realization of the BBPSSW purification protocol. We further show that coherent register control enables interferometric diagnostics such as fidelity witnessing and calibration, providing tools unavailable in classical programmability. Finally, we discuss scalability to multi-electron and multi-nuclear spin architectures and connection to Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) and Kraus formulation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid approach (qUCC) to reduce quantum circuit depth while maintaining accuracy for systems with strong correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional UCC methods in scaling to large quantum systems by reducing circuit depth through hybridization.

Method: The method involves using Taylor series expansion for UCC factors with small angles, treating large-angle factors exactly. This approach is applied to quadratic order (qUCC).

Result: The results demonstrate significant improvements in handling strong correlations and geometrical distortions, with exact treatment of a manageable number of factors leading to systematic convergence. This method outperforms traditional coupled cluster approaches in challenging systems.

Conclusion: The qUCC method successfully balances circuit depth reduction with accuracy, offering a promising approach for quantum computations in complex molecular systems like hydrogen chains and BeH2.

Abstract: The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) algorithm is one of the most promising implementations of the variational quantum eigensolver for quantum computers. However, for large systems, the number of UCC factors leads to deep quantum circuits, which are prohibitive for execution on quantum hardware. To address this, circuit depth can be reduced at the cost of more measurements with a Taylor series expansion of UCC factors with small angles, while treating the large-angle factors exactly. We implement this approach to quadratic order (qUCC) for systems with strong correlations and systems where conventional methods like coupled cluster (CC) with low excitation levels fail, but UCC and qUCC perform well. We study hydrogen chains and the BeH2 molecule that allow us to change the degree of strong correlation due to geometrical distortions. We show, via a dramatic increase in number of factors able to handle exactly, a systematic convergence of these results as more exact UCC factors are included in the calculations -- the hardest to converge regime is in the crossover from weak to strong coupling. In all cases the total number of UCC factors needed to be treated exactly is much less than the total number of UCC factors available (typically about one-third to one-half of the total number of factors).

Conclusion: 这些机制的共同点是改变电池结束半周期的电位，从而提高锂离子库存。建立了定量模型，可为其他电池系统的设计提供指导。

Abstract: Silicon-containing lithium-ion batteries can exhibit capacity gain early in life, which makes forecasting future cell behavior difficult. We have observed these anomalous trends even in conditions where known mechanisms, such as overhang equalization and excessive electrolyte oxidation, are unlikely to be significant. Here, we combine simulations and experiments to analyze four cases that can produce increased capacity in Si cells. Three of these pathways relate to break-in processes, where improved mass and charge transport can lead to increased access to active electrode domains and decreased cell impedance. The fourth case occurs at high levels of prelithiation, when the positive electrode (PE) is completely replenished with Li+ at the end of cell discharge. We show that the commonality among these mechanisms is that the underlying transformations change the potentials experienced by electrodes at the end of half-cycles, increasing the Li+ inventory available to the cell. A quantitative framework to describe these effects is presented, enabling these ideas to be extended to other battery systems.

TL;DR:   An efficient PIMD implementation in LAMMPS has been developed and shown to achieve several-fold acceleration compared to i-PI, particularly for water simulations using DP potentials.  


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:   High computational demands of PIMD, especially with a large number of beads, necessitate efficient implementations to leverage modern supercomputers fully.  

Method:   The implementation, fix pimd/langevin in LAMMPS, optimizes molecular dynamics calculations using MD and MPICH, with support for interatomic potentials like DP.  

Result:   The code achieves significant acceleration for water simulations and scales well in parallel environments.  

Conclusion:   This implementation enhances the efficiency of PIMD simulations, making them more accessible for large-scale studies.  

Abstract: Path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD), which maps a quantum particle onto a fictitious classical system of ring polymers and propagates the "beads" of this extended classical system using molecular dynamics, is widely used to capture nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) in molecular simulations. Accurate PIMD calculations typically require a large number of beads and are therefore computationally demanding. While software packages such as i-PI offer comprehensive PIMD functionality, the high efficiency of simulations driven by machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Deep Potential (DP), calls for more efficient PIMD implementations that fully exploit modern massively parallel supercomputers. Here we present fix pimd/langevin, an efficient PIMD implementation in LAMMPS that supports commonly used features and leverages the Message Passing Interface architecture of LAMMPS to achieve high computational efficiency. We demonstrate the usage and validate the correctness of our code using liquid water as a representative example, and provide a comprehensive overview of the supported features. Then we discuss several important technical aspects of the implementation. Using DP simulations of water as a benchmark, we show that our implementation achieves several-fold acceleration compared to i-PI. Finally, we report strong and weak scaling results that demonstrate the favorable parallel performance of our code.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The precision and performance challenges in simulating non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems drive the development of efficient algorithms.

Method: The EH-TEMPO algorithm reformulates the Feynman-Vernon influence functional as an imaginary time evolution governed by an effective Hamiltonian, which is compactly represented as a matrix product operator. It combines one-shot global evolution with a backward retrieval approach for enhanced efficiency.

Result: When benchmarked against the process tensor TEMPO algorithm, EH-TEMPO achieves numerically exact accuracy with significant speedups of up to 17.5x on GPU hardware compared with standard CPU implementations.

Conclusion: EH-TEMPO represents a substantial advancement in the simulation of open quantum systems through enhanced accuracy and algorithmic efficiency, particularly leveraging GPU acceleration compared to traditional CPU-based methods.

Abstract: Accurately simulating the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems remains a significant challenge. While the recently proposed time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) algorithm based on path integrals successfully circumvents the exponential scaling associated with memory length, its reliance on layer-by-layer tensor contractions and compressions leads to steep scaling with respect to the system Hilbert space dimension. In this work, we introduce the effective Hamiltonian-based TEMPO (EH-TEMPO) algorithm, which reformulates the calculation of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional as an imaginary time evolution governed by an effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that this effective Hamiltonian admits a highly compact matrix product operator representation, enabling substantial compression with negligible loss of accuracy. Combining a one-shot global evolution with a backward retrieval approach, EH-TEMPO significantly reduces algorithmic complexity and is naturally suited for GPU acceleration. We benchmark the method against the process tensor TEMPO algorithm using the 7-site Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex model. The results demonstrate that EH-TEMPO achieves numerically exact accuracy with superior efficiency, delivering speedups of up to 17.5x on GPU hardware compared to standard CPU implementations.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A framework is created to reconstruct the spinors Γ7 and Γ8 of Cr³⁺ ions in glasses using optical measurements. The spin-orbit coupling constant, crystal field strength, and Racah parameters are derived from the absorption spectrum. The entanglement entropy is calculated and analyzed across a range of chromium-doped glasses. Initially, no correlations were found between individual parameters and the entanglement entropy, but a linear relationship emerged when examining the ratio of the spin-orbit coupling constant to the crystal field strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the spin-orbit coupling and its effects on quantum states in materials is crucial for advancements in quantum information technology and materials science. The entanglement entropy is a key measure of quantum correlations, and elucidating its dependence on material parameters is essential.

Method: The method involves synthesizing an aluminum phosphate glass doped with 1 mol % chromium, recording its optical absorption spectrum, and using it to reconstruct the spinors. From these spinors, the spin-orbit coupling constant, crystal field strength, and Racah parameters are calculated. Finally, the spin-orbital entanglement entropy is computed and analyzed across different Glasses.

Result: The research reveals that individual material parameters (spin-orbit coupling constant, crystal field strength, Racah parameters) do not exhibit a direct correlation with the entanglement entropy. However, the ratio of the spin-orbit coupling constant to the crystal field strength shows a linear correlation with the entanglement entropy. This finding suggests that the interplay between these parameters in influencing quantum correlations is non-trivial and requires further investigation.

Conclusion: The developed framework successfully reconstructs the spinors and calculates the spin-orbit coupling parameters and entanglement entropy for chromium-doped Glasses. The results highlight the importance of considering the ratio of the spin-orbit coupling constant to the crystal field strength when studying entanglement entropy in such systems.

Abstract: A framework for reconstructing the one-electron spinors $Γ_7$ and $Γ_8$ of Cr$^{3+}$ embedded in glasses from optical measurements has been developed. From the spinors, the spin-orbital von Neumann entropy can be calculated. An aluminum phosphate glass doped with 1 mol % chromium is prepared, and its optical absorption spectrum is recorded to validate the method. The spin-orbit coupling constant, crystal field strength, and Racah parameters are obtained from the absorption spectrum. Subsequently, the spin-orbital entanglement entropy is calculated and analyzed for a family of chromium-doped glasses. It is found that individually, neither the spin-orbit coupling constant, nor the crystal field strength, nor the Racah parameters correlate with the entanglement entropy. In contrast, the ratio between the spin-orbit coupling constant and the crystal field strength correlates linearly with the entanglement entropy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to develop machine learning potentials (MLPs) that achieve both high accuracy and high computational efficiency for modern molecular simulations. The challenge lies in balancing model performance with computational cost, especially for complex molecular systems.

The approach combines these elements to model the total potential energy as a sum of effective monomeric contributions.

Result: The results show that MB-PIPNet accurately reproduces reference ab initio electronic energies and reliably captures key molecular properties. It also demonstrates a substantial advantage in computational efficiency over other MLP models for combined energy and force evaluations. The framework is scalable and efficient, making it suitable for large-scale quantum and classical simulations of complex molecular systems.

Conclusion: This paper successfully introduces an efficient and accurate machine learning potential framework (MB-PIPNet) that can be applied to a wide range of molecular systems, addressing a significant challenge in the field of molecular simulations.

Abstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLPs) have become important tools for modern molecular simulations. However, developing models that simultaneously achieve high accuracy and high computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. In this work, we extend the recently proposed MB-PIPNet framework to general covalently bonded molecular systems by combining monomer-based energy decomposition, permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) descriptors, and neural networks within a fragmentation-based strategy. Within this framework, the total potential energy is represented as a sum of effective monomeric contributions, where PIPs provide compact and chemically motivated descriptions of both monomer internal structures and their local chemical environments. As a proof-of-concept application, we apply the MB-PIPNet framework to linear alkanes, using n-Tetradecane as a representative system, and benchmark its performance against established atomistic machine-learning models. The resulting MB-PIPNet potential accurately reproduces reference ab initio electronic energies and reliably captures key molecular properties, including torsional potential energy profiles, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and vibrational power spectra obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Importantly, MB-PIPNet demonstrates a substantial advantage in computational efficiency over other MLP models for combined energy and force evaluations. These results establish MB-PIPNet as a scalable and efficient framework for constructing MLPs, providing an additional route for large-scale quantum and classical simulations of complex molecular systems.

Result: They successfully developed a quantitative framework that links the structure, excitonic coupling, and charge-transfer interactions of PCPs with their optical properties. This framework provides valuable design principles for optoelectronic materials.

Conclusion: This study bridges theoretical models and experimental results, offering a comprehensive understanding of PCPs' properties and establishing design guidelines for optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Aromatic $π$-stacking interactions play an important role in both natural and artificial systems, influencing processes such as charge separation in photosynthesis and charge transport in organic semiconductors. Controlling the geometry and distance between aromatic units is therefore crucial for tuning intermolecular interactions and charge-transfer efficiency. Due to their well-defined stacking geometry, paracyclophanes (PCPs) composed of two or more aromatic units connected by rigid linkers, provide an ideal platform for a systematic study of such effects. Despite extensive experimental studies of PCPs, a comprehensive and quantitatively validated theoretical description linking the structure with the electronic and optical properties is still missing. Here, we present an extensive computational and experimental investigation of the electronic and optical properties of homo-PCPs containing naphthalene diimide (NDI) or pyrene chromophores linked by bridges of varying length and rigidity. We introduce a robust methodology for an accurate simulation of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of PCPs based on a combined TD-DFT and CC2 approach, achieving excellent quantitative agreement with experiment. We also present and validate a fragment-based description of PCPs using the Frenkel exciton model. Such approach is valuable not only for interpretation of the electronic and optical properties of PCPs, but it can also significantly reduce the cost of the calculation while maintaining the accuracy of the supermolecular approach. This work establishes a quantitatively reliable framework linking structure, excitonic coupling, and charge-transfer interactions in PCPs with optical properties, providing design principles for next-generation optoelectronic materials.

Abstract: Determining the structure and following the structural evolution of molecules undergoing chemical reactions is one of the key goals of ultrafast molecular physics and chemistry. Recently, Coulomb explosion imaging has emerged as a promising technique for imaging the evolving structure of individual molecules in the gas phase. However, its practical application for structure determination is hampered by the lack of suitable algorithms to directly retrieve the molecular structure from the measured fragment-ion momentum data. Here, we propose a scheme to solve the underlying inverse problem by employing neural networks to infer the initial atomic positions from the final ion momenta on an event-by-event basis. Using this scheme, we retrieve the structure of several polyhalomethane isomers from simulated Coulomb explosion imaging data with an average per-atom position error of approximately 0.1 atomic units, i.e., to within 5% of the typical bond lengths. This development paves the way for an automated structure retrieval from Coulomb explosion data one molecule at a time, making it ideally suitable for analyzing pump-probe experiments where several products are formed that need to be distinguished.

Abstract: Coarse-grained molecular dynamics often sacrifices accuracy and transferability for computational efficiency, but the use of machine learned potentials is helping coarse-grained models attain performance on par with atomistic molecular dynamics. Nevertheless, developing representations of the coarse-grained potential energy surface faces severe scaling challenges due to the extreme data demands of widely used "bottom-up" coarse-graining objectives. In this work, we show that mean force matching, a strategy for training thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained models, requires 50x fewer training samples and 87% less total atomistic simulation time, while obtaining better accuracy on the potential of mean force for unseen proteins compared to other commonly used objectives. By systematically removing noise from the objective function, we demonstrate that it is possible to scale machine learning architectures for coarse-graining, enabling highly accurate and transferable models. We show the advantages of mean force matching both theoretically and through exhaustive benchmarking using thermodynamic consistency as the primary metric of accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work prompted need for more efficient simulation methods without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Utilizes non-conservative forces with a dual-level reversible propagator algorithm to enhance simulation speed while maintaining physical accuracy.

Result: DMTS-NC shows 15-30% speedup, is more stable and easier to implement.

Conclusion: DMTS-NC advances acceleration strategies in molecular dynamics simulations, particularly for neural network potentials, offering significant practical benefits.

Abstract: Following our previous work (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2026, 17, 5, 1288-1295), we propose the DMTS-NC approach, a distilled multi-time-step (DMTS) strategy using non conservative (NC) forces to further accelerate atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the "holes" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS. Requiring no finetuning steps, it is easier to implement and can be pushed to the limit of the systems physical resonances to maintain accuracy while providing maximum efficiency. As for DMTS, DMTS-NC is applicable to any neural network potential.

Abstract: Fast secondary neutrons created at the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP) facility following proton irradiation were characterized by the foil activation technique and compared with FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations. The FLUKA-simulated neutron flux was spectrally adjusted following the maximum entropy formalism using the International Reactor Dosimetry and Fusion File (IRDFF-II), with predictions agreeing with experimental measurements to within 9% following the adjustment procedure. A multitude of degrader configurations were simulated to assess the feasibility of improving the fast (En > 20 MeV) secondary neutron yield at the proposed neutron target position (N-slot). A configuration where the N-slot is closest to the proton degrader produced the highest fast neutron yield, with tungsten degraders achieving the best performance. Assuming the optimized target-degrader configuration proposed in this work, we discuss potential isotope production opportunities with secondary neutrons. In most cases the yields are in the order of several mCi.

Abstract: The unique anisotropic properties of graphene, particularly impermeability, have made it a promising candidate for further advances in corrosion prevention applications. Despite the large number of experimental works divulging the use of graphene in anticorrosion coatings, there is no report on the numerical modelling and simulation of the relationships between the orientation of graphene sheets in composite coatings and the introduced corrosion protection efficiency, to our knowledge. Herein, it is tried to model the influence of the orientation of graphene sheets dispersed in organic coatings on the diffusivity and flux of corrosive substances besides the corrosion initiation time of the protected substrates. To discover the relationship between the graphene orientation and corrosion-related phenomena, this study introduces a novel model consisting of a trigonometric factor named unprotected projected surface area proportion, which calculates corrosion-related parameters based on the principal Fick's laws. The model reveals that the decrease in the angle between graphene sheets and the substrate is highly beneficial for postponing the corrosion onset. It is accordingly estimated that a mismatch angle of 10 degree can slow down the diffusion process significantly and delay the corrosion initiation by around 65 times in a 100 micron thick epoxy/graphene composite coating in comparison to the counterpart with the perpendicular alignment. The predicted corrosion parameters were in a good agreement with the experimental data, indicating the merit of the proposed model. Thus, this model can be further employed as the fundamental of future research on the optimum graphene orientation in anticorrosion composite coatings.

Abstract: Cellular metamaterials offer a vast design space for tailoring nonlinear mechanical responses, yet exploring this space with conventional modeling approaches is often infeasible or not scalable. To fully exploit their nonlinear behavior for inverse design, it is essential to learn the full stress-strain response rather than relying on bulk quantities, motivating the use of neural operators for function-to-function mapping. However, data-driven modeling of nonlinear response for metamaterials is severely constrained by the limited availability of costly experimental data. Here, we propose a Bayesian multi-fidelity deep operator network that aggregates abundant low-fidelity finite element simulations with sparse high-fidelity experimental data from in-situ nanomechanical experiments on spinodal metamaterials, enabling heterogeneous information aggregation. A hybrid Bayesian active learning strategy is introduced to select informative samples by jointly maximizing epistemic uncertainty and geometric diversity of the microstructure, substantially reducing the cost of 3D nonlinear simulations. This approach adaptively trains the low-fidelity operator, which is then augmented by a high-fidelity Bayesian residual learner. We demonstrate that only 22 strategically selected samples from a design pool of 3000 are sufficient to achieve an 84.1 percent reduction in MSE compared to the high-fidelity baseline. The framework significantly outperforms single-fidelity baselines, providing superior predictions for full nonlinear stress-strain responses as well as stiffness, strength, and energy absorption. This work provides a robust, data-efficient pathway for the inverse design and constitutive modeling of cellular metamaterials.

Abstract: Dielectric waveguide (DWG) interconnects frequently utilize multimode waveguides due to their low dispersion in the fundamental mode. However, these links are more vulnerable to cross-modal coupling that significantly impacts their overall performance. This study presents a technique aimed at minimizing the coupling of energy into higher-order modes within weakly coupled rectangular dielectric waveguides that are excited by a linear taper. The approach involves wrapping the waveguide with a material of a higher dielectric constant than both the core and the cladding of the waveguide. The added material significantly improves the modal confinement factor of the fundamental mode to the core, leading to a much smaller coupling to the parasitic higher-order cladding modes. The new waveguide with the additional material cladding is analyzed, and semi-analytical approximate expressions are derived to predict the mode profiles and cutoffs. Design equations are given to choose the thickness of the wrapping material. The waveguide is fabricated and compared against a similar cross-section waveguide without the additional wrapping material. Unlike the unwrapped waveguide, the group delay (GD) results of the proposed (wrapped) waveguide closely match the EM-simulated GD of the fundamental mode, confirming the significant isolation of higher-order modes. The measured GD of the proposed DWG is 50 ps/m, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 35 ps/m. On the contrary, the unwrapped DWG shows a measured GD of 200 ps/m with significant oscillations, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 25 ps/m, demonstrating that wrapping the waveguide significantly improves the GD by reducing the higher-order mode propagation.

### [152] [Measuring Spin-Charge Separation by an Off-diagonal Dissipative Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13776)
*Liang Tong,Shi Chen,Yu Chen*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: Fractionalization of symmetry in quantum systems has been studied, but its experimental detection remains challenging. This paper proposes a dissipative response protocol using DRT to directly detect spin-charge separation. By selectively dissipating spin-↓ particles and measuring spin-↑ response, a universal temporal signature is observed: cubic growth at short times and linear decay at long times. Coefficients encode anomalous dimensions and velocities, effectivelly proving fractionalization. Numerical verification using tDMRG and microscopic parameters validate the approach for detecting quantum fractionalization in synthetic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents an innovative method to verify the phenomenon of fractionalization, a key aspect in the study of quantum many-body systems. It provides a clear pathway for experimentalists to detect previously elusive excitations.

Method: The authors propose the use of off-diagonal dissipative response theory, employing numerical simulations (tDMRG) and a Bethe ansatz-based approach for verifying the theoretical framework. They discuss the selective dissipation of particular spin states and the measurement of the resulting responses.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates that the off-diagonal dissipative response exhibits distinct temporal behavior, specifically a transition from cubic to linear growth. This behavior correlates with the presence of fractional excitations, providing unambiguous evidence of spin-charge separation. The findings contribute to the understanding of quantum fractionalization and offer a practical method for its experimental detection.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol marks a significant step forward in the experimental investigation of quantum fractionalization. It opens new avenues for studying exotic states of matter and their underlying mechanisms in both theoretical and applied physics contexts.

Abstract: Fractionalization of symmetry - exemplified by spin-charge separation in the 1D Hubbard model and fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect - is a typical strongly correlated phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite the success in measuring velocity differences, however, it is still quite challenging in probing emergent excitations' anomalous dimensions experimentally. We propose a off-diagonal dissipative response protocol, leveraging dissipative response theory (DRT), to directly detect spin-charge separation. By selectively dissipating spin-$\downarrow$ particles and measuring the spin-$\uparrow$ response, we uncover a universal temporal signature: the off-diagonal response exhibits a crossover from cubic-in-time ($t^3$) growth at short times to linear-in-time ($t$) decay at long times. Crucially, the coefficients $\varkappa^s$ (short-time) and $\varkappa^l$ (long-time) encode the distinct anomalous dimensions and velocities of spinons and holons, providing unambiguous evidence of fractionalization. This signal vanishes trivially without spin-charge separation. Our predictions, verified numerically via tDMRG, with microscopic parameters linking with Luttinger parameters by Bethe ansatz, establish off-diagonal dissipative response as a probe of quantum fractionalization in synthetic quantum matter.

Motivation: Cold atoms are vital for quantum technologies, but their transport challenges limit scalability. This work addresses these challenges for near-degenerate temperatures, opening new quantum sensing and computing possibilities.

Method: Moving optical lattice using two Bessel beams directed oppositely. A gas of 3×10^5 ytterbium atoms at 340nK is transported 34cm in 350ms with >60% efficiency. A degenerate gas with 40% condensate fraction is produced through phase synchronization driven by atomic interactions. The method enables fast preparation of ultracold atomic beams and arrays for quantum sensing, simulation, and computing.

Result: Highly efficient transport demonstrated with scalability, facilitating significant advances in quantum technologies.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in cold atom transport paves the way for scalable quantum devices and technologies by overcoming key limitations in atom transport near quantum degeneracy.

Abstract: Efficient transport of cold atoms is essential for continuous operation, enabling applications ranging from atomic lasers to continuously operated qubits. However, deep potentials required to overcome vibrations, axial trap nonuniformity and insufficient cooling have limited transport of cold atoms near quantum degeneracy. Here we demonstrate rapid optical transport of cold atoms to Bose-Einstein condensation using a moving optical lattice formed by two Bessel beams. A gas of $3 \times 10^5$ ytterbium atoms at a temperature of $340\,$nK is transported over $34\,$cm in $350\,$ms with efficiency over $60\%$. Furthermore, a degenerate gas of $1 \times 10^5$ atoms with a $40\%$ condensate fraction emerges from the phase synchronization process driven by atomic interactions. This demonstration enables the fast preparation of ultracold atomic beams and large-scale atom arrays for quantum sensing, simulation and computing.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to measure atom-surface interactions using a combination of different traps and a rotating surface. The method allows measuring the Casimir-Polder force coefficient with a relative uncertainty of 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand atom-surface interactions, specifically measuring the Casimir-Polder force coefficient, which has important implications in fields like quantum sensing and nanotechnology.

Method: The method combines an optical dipole trap, a magnetic trap using current-carrying wires, and a rotating surface. This setup allows adiabatic transport of a Rb BEC from a few micrometers to a few hundred nanometers from the surface. The experiment also includes modeling noise-induced heating and calibration biases.

Result: The result shows that using typical trapping parameters, the relative uncertainty of the Casimir-Polder force coefficient ($c_4$) is estimated to be 10%.

Conclusion: This method provides a feasible and accurate way to measure the Casimir-Polder force, which can be applied to other atomic species as well.

Abstract: We propose a novel method to measure the interaction between an ultracold gas of neutral atoms and a surface. This solution combines an optical dipole trap reflected by the surface, a magnetic trap formed by current carrying wires embedded below the surface, and a rotation of the surface itself. It allows to adiabatically transport a $^{87}$Rb BEC from few $μ$m to few hundred nm of the surface. At such distances, atom-surface interaction strongly affects the trapping potential, causing an increase of the tunneling rate towards the surface. In this paper, we show that the measurement of the lifetime of the cloud and its comparison to a tunneling model will allow to extract the Casimir-Polder (CP) force coefficient in the retarded regime ($c_4$). Our model includes noise-induced heating, calibration biases of experimentally controlled parameters and accuracy of the atom lifetime measurement. Using typical trapping parameters and experimental uncertainties, we numerically estimate the relative uncertainty of $c_4$ to be 10%. This method can be implemented with any atomic species that can be magnetically and optically trapped.

Abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a synthetic Hall torus using a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring-shaped trap with in situ imaging. By cyclically coupling three hyperfine spin states via Raman and microwave fields, we impose a periodic boundary condition in the synthetic dimension, which together with a real-space ring trap, realizes a toroidal geometry with a synthetic magnetic flux. This flux induces azimuthal density modulations in the condensate, whose periodicity is uniquely determined by the quantized toroidal magnetic flux-a hallmark of the Hall torus geometry. By varying the relative phase between the couplings across repeated experimental runs, we control the location of the density extrema, emulating the behavior of Thouless charge pump in a toroidal geometry. We further investigate the onset of these modulations as the system transitions from a cylindrical to a toroidal topology. Our results establish a versatile platform for investigating quantum Hall physics and topological phenomena in synthetic curved spaces.

Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated systems in two dimensions is notoriously challenging due to rapid entanglement growth and frustration. Here, we introduce the adaptive projected-purified pseudoboson density-matrix renormalization group (A3P-DMRG) tailored to explore the ground states of dilute lattice models. The method compresses cluster Hilbert spaces by retaining only the most probable low-occupation Fock states, identified via probabilistic bounds and refined through a self-consistent mean-field basis optimization. We demonstrate that A3P-DMRG is advantageous in low-filling and weak-coupling regimes for large system sizes where conventional DMRG struggles. This establishes the method as a versatile tool for studying dilute quantum many-body systems relevant to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators, photonic lattices, Moiré materials and quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Spin ladders are key models that act as intermediaries between one-dimensional and two-dimensional spin systems. In this study, we examine a coupled spin-$1/2$ ladder, where frustrated ladders with leg, rung, and diagonal interactions are linked through a horizontal coupling. By introducing a spatially anisotropic third-nearest-neighbor interaction along the horizontal direction, the model was found to possess an exact dimer ground state, characterized by a product of singlets forming a columnar dimer phase. The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a Néel ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to Néel phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the Néel order vanishes for $J_1 > 4.5$. The static spin structure factor further corroborates the nature of the ordered phases.

TL;DR: The paper describes a hidden density-wave instability in the ruthenate compound Ba4Ru3O10, which exhibits lattice, charge, and magnetic anomalies at low temperatures, suggesting an electronically driven reconstruction mechanism influenced by its antiferromagnetic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the hidden instabilities in oxide materials is crucial for advancing the field of correlated electron systems and developing new materials with tailored electronic and magnetic properties.

Method: The study employs a combination of first-principles electronic structure calculations and inelastic light scattering analysis to analyze the material's properties at different temperatures and magnetic fields.

Result: The material exhibits a phase transition at TA = 100 K, characterized by lattice deformations and changes in magnetic susceptibility. At lower temperatures (T* = 20 K), it shows nonlinear charge transport phenomena such as depinning thresholds and negative differential resistance, consistent with a density-wave scenario.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that Ba4Ru3O10 hosts a unique correlated electronic state hosting a strongly pinned collective electronic mode intertwined with antiferromagnetism, providing new insights into density-wave physics in oxide compounds.

Abstract: We report a hidden density-wave instability in the trimer-based ruthenate Ba4Ru3O10, previously regarded as a pure antiferromagnet with a phase transition at TA=100 K. This transition is manifested in lattice parameters, transport, thermodynamics, and magnetic susceptibility, yet remains remarkably insensitive to magnetic fields up to at least 14 T, indicating an electronically driven reconstruction. At much lower temperatures T*= 20 K, charge transport becomes strongly nonlinear, exhibiting distinct depinning thresholds, negative differential resistance, pronounced current- and frequency-dependence, and slow collective dynamics in the Hertz range. While each feature is characteristic of density-wave transport, their simultaneous occurrence in an antiferromagnetic oxide is unprecedented. All nonlinear signatures vanish upon only 3% Ir substitution, which preserves the crystal structure and insulating state, ruling out Joule heating or extrinsic artifacts. The wide separation between the electronic reconstruction at TA and the emergence of nonlinear dynamics at T* identifies Ba4Ru3O10 as a rare correlated system hosting a strongly pinned collective electronic state intertwined with antiferromagnetism.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the evolution of magnetic correlation in strongly correlated systems, specifically focusing on systems with alternating magnetic spin splitting. The study examines how the spin splitting generated by spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor hopping, parameterized by $t'$, affects the Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularities in a two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model. The research uses the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method to determine how the momentum-resolved spin structure factor changes with the system's filling and the ratio $t'/t$. The findings reveal a transition from antiferromagnetic $(π,π)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(π,q)$ order as the spin anisotropy or doping increases beyond half-filling, ultimately leading to a regime where both stripe and spiral correlations coexist. This suggests a potential pathway for designing systems that realize spiral magnetic correlations, which could be useful for future spintronic applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the evolution of magnetic correlations in strongly correlated electron systems is crucial for advancing our knowledge of complex quantum phenomena. This paper addresses a gap in the exploration of magnetic correlation dynamics in systems with alternating magnetic spin splitting, which has not been thoroughly investigated despite its relevance to potential spintronic applications.

Method: The study employs the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method to compute the momentum-resolved spin structure factor in a two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model. This method allows for the systematic investigation of how the system's parameters, such as $t'/t$ and the electron filling factor, influence the dominant magnetic correlations.

Result: The research finds a transition from antiferromagnetic $(π,π)$ order to non-collinear spiral $(π,q)$ order, with further evidence of coexisting stripe and spiral correlations in the short-range correlation regime. The findings suggest that spiral magnetic correlations can emerge in systems with alternating magnetic spin splitting, potentially offering a new avenue for the design of spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of magnetic correlations in systems with alternating magnetic spin splitting. The study reveals a clear pathway for the emergence of non-collinear spiral magnetic correlations, which could pave the way for the realization of spintronic devices that leverage these unique magnetic properties.

Abstract: The evolution of magnetic correlation in strongly correlated electron systems with altermagentic spin splitting remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate how spin splitting generated by spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ reshapes the Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularities in the two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model, leading evolution of magnetic instabilities. Using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, we find the dominant magnetic correlation as functions of the filling and $t'/t$ by computing the momentum-resolved spin structure factor. The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(π,π)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(π,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist. These findings highlight a possible route to realizing spiral correlation in altermagnetic systems, potentially providing a platform for spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In topological bands, it is impossible to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions while preserving the symmetries. Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems.

Motivation: Understanding exotic quantum phenomena and the role of non-Hermiticity and PT symmetry in such systems is crucial for advancing our knowledge of complex quantum systems and their applications. This research provides a unique opportunity to study these phenomena in a controllable and symmetric setup, offering new insights into the behavior of Kondo systems under non-Hermitian conditions.

Method: The study employs several sophisticated theoretical tools, including the Bethe ansatz, non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group calculations, and boundary conformal field theory, to analyze the low-energy spectrum, thermodynamic quantities, and transport properties of the system.

Result: 1. The existence of a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like state is identified in the model under the conditions of PT asymmetry. 2. Numerical evidence suggests that this state emerges distinctly in the PT-symmetric regime with strong non-Hermiticity. 3. The Kondo conductance exhibits an anomalous temperature dependence, which can't be explained by conventional Hermitian Kondo systems.

Conclusion: The research successfully combines non-Hermitian physics and PT-symmetry to uncover new collective quantum phenomena, providing a deeper understanding of these exotic systems and opening new avenues for future studies.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo problems host both non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermitian physics, which provide a prototypical model to explore exotic collective quantum phenomena driven by the two different ingredients. Here, we first propose an experimental setup that realizes this model with exact channel symmetry as well as a controllable PT symmetry. Then, we perform a multi-method study of this model, focusing on the low-energy spectrum, the thermodynamic quantities, and the transport properties associated with different fixed points. Using the Bethe ansatz approach, we identify existence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like state previously found in the non-Hermitian single-channel Kondo model. Then, based on non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group calculations, we reveal clear numerical signatures of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state emerging in the relatively strong non-Hermiticity regime of the PT-asymmetric model. Furthermore, our boundary conformal field theory, which is found to be applicable for the PT-symmetric model, uncovers an anomalous temperature dependence of the Kondo conductance, which is beyond conventional Hermitian Kondo systems.

Abstract: Strong correlation, when combined with dissipation in open systems, can lead to a variety of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we study nontrivial interplays between non-Fermi liquid behaviors emerging from strong correlation and non-Hermiticity arising from open systems. We propose a practical physical setup that realizes a non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model. We identify a weak-coupling local moment fixed point and a strong-coupling non-Fermi liquid fixed point under PT symmetry, both are enriched by the non-Hermitian effect. Remarkably, universal unconventional Kondo conductance behaviors are found for both cases, which are distinct from all previously studied Kondo systems. Particularly, we show that an anomalous upturn of conductance could take place with increasing the temperature, originating from the interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity. Our results identify a novel class of transport phenomena unrecognized before, driven by intertwined effects of correlation and dissipation.

Abstract: We present a first-principles investigation of magnetic exchange interactions and critical behavior in (111)-oriented (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$|(SrMnO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices for $n=2,4,6$. For all superlattices under investigation, we find robust half-metallic ferromagnetism extending across all the layers of both component regions. Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. Conversely, as thickness increases, a two-phase behavior emerges, where the SrMnO$_3$ region loses long-range order faster than the LaMnO$_3$ region. While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Incorporate controlled disorder in correlated materials, particularly VO₂- and V₂O₃-based resistive-switching oscillators, can induce stochastic firing. Ion beam irradiation increases disorder, leading to transitions from regular to irregular oscillations and reduces switching energy. The systems functionality is validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of neuromorphic hardware necessitates the exploration of non-conventional computing methods, particularly those that can mimic biological neural networks. The ability to create devices with inherent stochastic behavior is essential for emulating the irregular activity seen in biological systems.

Method: The research employs a multi-faceted approach combining experimental and numerical methods. Irradiation experiments are conducted on VO₂ and V₂O₃-based oscillators, and numerical simulations are based on the Mott resistor network model dedicated to studying defect dynamics and nucleation processes.

Result: The key findings include the induction of irregular firing patterns, reduction in switching energy, and the formation of percolating metallic filaments. These results indicate that disorder can be harnessed to create more efficient and adaptable devices suitable for neuromorphic applications.

Conclusion: The successful integration of controlled disorder in certain materials provides a novel pathway for creating efficient neuromorphic hardware with enhanced functionalities. This approach could pave the way for the development of more sophisticated and biologically inspired electronic devices, potentially revolutionizing the field of neuromorphic computing.)

Abstract: Controlled disorder in correlated materials provides a new route to emergent stochastic dynamics in neuromorphic hardware. Here we show that focused ion beam irradiation in VO$_{2}$- and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$-based resistive-switching oscillators induces a transition from regular periodic oscillations to strongly irregular stochastic firing, while simultaneously reducing the required switching energy by orders of magnitude. Under an applied electric field, these materials undergo a volatile insulator-to-metal transition characterized by the formation of percolating metallic filaments within an insulating bulk. Using numerical simulations based on the Mott resistor network, we demonstrate that defect-induced modifications to filament nucleation and stability drive these devices into stochastic oscillatory regimes. These results are validated by experimental measurements on irradiated VO$_{2}$ and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices.

Conclusion: 分数组符的产生机制被打通了连续与离散拓扑相变的理论框架，提出了在实空间中的操作性条件来检测和设计各种拓扑相变。

Abstract: The understanding of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has been deeply guided by band topology and quantum geometry. Here, we introduce a real-space theoretical framework in which FCIs are understood in terms of composite bosons, local objects consisting of electrons bound to their energetically excluded surrounding orbitals. The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms.

Abstract: Using quantum distance, magnetic susceptibility in the non-interacting limit can be rigorously split into two contributions: one arising solely from band dispersion, while the other stems from quantum geometric contributions. In this Letter, we apply this decomposition to two materials, LaFeAsO and Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O, and demonstrate that their dominant magnetic fluctuations originate from the geometric contribution. In LaFeAsO, stripe-type antiferromagnetic fluctuations arise primarily from quantum geometry, while in Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O the geometric term suppresses antiferromagnetic fluctuations and stabilizes ferromagnetic fluctuations. Our findings highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in governing magnetic fluctuations in multi-band systems, and provide a unique and quantitative framework to disentangle band-structure and wavefunction-geometry effects that have often been discussed collectively as multi-orbital effects.

Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering experiments with a large set of comounted Na$_2$IrO$_3$ crystals reveal the low-energy magnon dispersion in this candidate material for Kitaev physics. The magnon gap amounts to 1.7(1) meV and can be interpreted similarly to the sister compound $α$-RuCl$_{3}$ to stem from the zone boundaries in the antiferromagnetic zigzag structure. The neutron experiments find no evidence for low-energy excitations with ferromagnetic character, which contrasts to the findings in $α$-RuCl$_{3}$. Our results are consistent with a recently proposed microscopic model that involves an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg nearest-neighbor exchange in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ in contrast to the ferromagnetic one considered for $α$-RuCl$_{3}$. Although the magnetic response shows the signatures of bond-directional anisotropy in both materials the different relative signs of Kitaev and Heisenberg interaction result in different deviations from the initial Kitaev model. Low-energy ferromagnetic fluctuations cannot be considered as a fingerprint of ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium many-body physics is one of the core problems in modern physics, while the dynamical scaling from a gapless phase to the critical point is a most important challenge with very few knowledge so far. In the driven dynamics with a tuning rate $R$ across the quantum critical point (QCP) of a system with size $L$, the finite-time scaling shows that the square of the order parameter $m^2$ obeys a simple scaling relation $m^2\propto R^{2β/νr}$ in the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling limit with $RL^r\gg1$. Here, by studying the driven critical dynamics from a gapless ordered phase in the bilayer Heisenberg model, we unveil that the approaches to the scaling region dominated by the KZ scaling limit with $RL^r\gg1$ are {\it non-commutative}: this scaling region is inaccessible for large $R$ and finite medium $L$, while merely accessible for large $L$ and moderately finite $R$. We attribute this to the memory effect induced by the finite-size correction in the gapless ordered phase. This non-commutative property makes $m^2$ still strongly depends on the system size and deviates from $m^2\propto R^{2β/νr}$ even for large $R$. We further show that a similar correction applies to the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics. Our results establish an essential extension of nonequilibrium scaling theory with a gapless ordered initial state.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a new compound, Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$, and reveal the hidden time-reversal-like degenerate states within it. Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ is an antiferromagnet with the distorted kagome lattice of Ce atoms, in which several fractional magnetization plateaus emerge with the increase of magnetic field. At the 1/2 magnetization plateau, obvious hysteresis has been observed in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity during the rise and fall of the magnetic field. However, hysteresis vanishes in the corresponding measurements of magnetization, indicating the existence of degenerate states with the same net magnetization but different electronic transport properties. The degenerate states can be connected by the time-reversal-like operation. In addition, by comparing with HoAgGe, it is suggested that the special crystal structure in Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ may have a shielding effect on the time-reversal-like operation, thereby affecting the distinction of degenerate states. Our work establishes Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ as an example of utilizing electronic transport properties to identify and distinguish hidden symmetries in frustrated magnetic systems.

Motivation: Understanding and realizing chiral topological phases is important for advancing the field of quantum materials and quantum computing.

Method: The authors used the VQE framework in combination with quantum circuits and the tangent space excitation ansatz to prepare and study chiral topological phases in spin systems.

Result: The proposed approach successfully demonstrated that low-energy excitation spectra in all topological sectors of the Kitaev honeycomb model matched well with the exact solution, and it also showed promise for non-exactly solvable models on square lattices.

Conclusion: The method provides a feasible route to prepare and characterize chiral topological phases in spin systems using quantum circuits.

Abstract: Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.

Abstract: We study the proximity effect in the Hubbard model coupled to BCS superconductors describing a single-layer strongly correlated electron system in a phase-biased Josephson junction. We find two distinct gapped solutions, one Mott-like insulating (M-phase) and one proximitized superconducting phase (S-phase), separated by first-order transition with hysteresis. In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $φ=π$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity.

TL;DR: The paper shows how external pressure can tune charge ordering in quantum materials by suppressing the momentum-dependent EPC in a rare-earth tetragonal system, providing evidence that the CDW transition in EuAl4 can be controlled via pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how external pressure affects charge ordering in quantum materials is crucial for materials science and condensed matter physics, as it can help in designing new materials with desired properties.

Method: The researchers used high hydrostatic pressure generated by diamond anvils and performed IXS experiments to study the effects of pressure on the EPC-mediated CDW transition in EuAl4.

Result: The study reveals that as temperature and pressure increase, momentum-dependent EPC decreases, leading to a suppression of the CDW transition in EuAl4, demonstrating the role of pressure in controlling CDW ordering.

Conclusion: The findings provide clear evidence that external pressure can be used as a controllable parameter to tune CDW transitions in rare-earth tetragonal materials, offering a new avenue for manipulating magnetic and electronic properties in such systems.

Abstract: In the intermetallid rare-earth tetragonal EuAl4 system, competing itinerant exchange mechanisms lead to a complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring a centrosymmetric skyrmion lattice. Previous inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) experiments revealed that the incommensurate charge-density wave (CDW) transition in EuAl4 (TCDW = 142 K) is driven by momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC). We present the results of IXS under high hydrostatic pressure induced by diaond anvils and show how the EPC in EuAl4 is renormalized and suppressed in the material's temperature-pressure phase diagram. Our findings highlight the crucial role of momentum-dependent EPC in the formation of the CDW in EuAl4 and provide further insights into how external pressure can be used to tune charge ordering in quantum materials.

Conclusion: 在能量上，研究结果支持区分两种不同量子态体的存在。高能量态为典型的狄拉克量子态体，低能量态可能表现出更接近磁性有序状态的特性，其中之一可能是一个微弱有序状态或间隙量子态。

Abstract: Previous studies of the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$--$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet have inferred the existence of a non-magnetic ground-state phase for an intermediate range of $J_2$, but disagree concerning whether it is a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL), a gapless (Dirac) QSL, or a weakly symmetry-broken phase. Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.

Abstract: We investigate the nematic phase transition in the Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$-model on square and triangular lattices, accounting for finite lattice compressibility and bond-length-dependent magnetic exchange. Using Nematic Bond Theory, a diagrammatic self-consistent method, we study the nematostriction that happens when the onset of nematic order in the spin-system drives a concomitant structural phase transition. We analyze the mechanisms by which the magnetoelastic couplings renormalize the critical temperature and modify the phonon spectrum. The magnetoelastic feeback can also alter fundamentally the nature of the phase transition. Specifically, on the square lattice, the transition shifts from continuous to weakly first-order (discontinuous) beyond a critical magnetoelastic coupling threshold. Conversely, on the triangular lattice, the transition remains discontinuous regardless of coupling strength.

Abstract: Recent experiments in moiré quantum materials exhibit quantized Hall states without an external magnetic field, motivating continuum mechanisms based on smooth moiré-periodic pseudospin textures. We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moiré-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and rhombohedral graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride.

Abstract: We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.

Abstract: Fuzzy sphere models conjecturally realize 3d CFTs in small systems of spinful fermions, but why they work so well is still not fully understood. Their Hamiltonians are built from electron density operators projected to the lowest Landau Level. We analyze the algebra of the density modes and verify that it satisfies the Jacobi identity. The fuzzy sphere geometry admits two thermodynamic limits: a local planar limit yielding the fuzzy plane, and a commutative limit yielding an ordinary sphere. In the planar limit, high-angular-momentum modes recover the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, whereas in the commutative limit the low-angular-momentum modes become semiclassical. We further find an explicit representation of the conformal algebra so(3,2) in the minimal two-electron system and extend it to larger systems via an so(3) equivariant coproduct. Because the coproduct splits one so(3) representation into a tensor product, it is structurally mismatched with the thermodynamic limit of critical fuzzy sphere Hamiltonians.

Abstract: The excavation of the Hyper-Kamiokande cavern, 600 m underground, is complete. Measuring 69 m in diameter and 94 m in height, it is among the world's largest rock caverns. A vertically oriented, dome-capped cylindrical design was chosen to optimize cost and performance. Combined with substantial overburden, the geometry posed major engineering challenges. This paper outlines the underground works, main cavern design, excavation plan, and the evolution of support design and construction methods during excavation, namely the information-based (observational) design and construction approach.

Abstract: Highly charged ions (HCIs) combine compact electronic structure with strong relativistic effects, offering both robustness against external perturbations and enhanced sensitivity to variations of the fine-structure constant. Recent advances in sympathetic cooling and trapping enable precision measurements of highly charged ions; however, fully exploiting their potential requires accurate theoretical predictions. In particular, reliable calculations of clock wavelengths are essential for experimentally locating HCI clock transitions. Here, we treat Cf17+ as a univalent ion and perform calculations within the relativistic coupled-cluster framework, iteratively including nonlinear single-double contributions and valence and core triple excitations. We also assess quantum-electrodynamic corrections and basis-set and partial-wave truncation effects. Our results establish the impact of different correlation contributions on the low-lying energy spectrum and provide a quantitatively reliable prediction of the 5f_5/2 - 6p_1/2 clock transition, highlighting the critical role of core-valence correlations and iterative triples for precision spectroscopy and optical clock development.

Motivation: Cold-atom interferometers are essential for gravimetry and fundamental physics, but their performance is limited by noise. This paper aims to address this challenge by proposing a new method for designing robust pulses.

Method: The study establishes a theoretical model for the atom-laser interaction and applies the Krotov quantum optimal control algorithm to optimize the temporal shape of the pulse's amplitude and phase.

Result: Numerical simulations show that the optimized pulses maintain high fidelity over a wider range of laser parameters compared to standard pulses. Additionally, the robustness of these pulses enhances fringe contrast in interferometer simulations.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that quantum optimal control can effectively suppress noise and improve the performance of cold-atom sensors.

Abstract: The performance of high-precision cold-atom interferometers, which are important for applications in gravimetry and fundamental physics, is often limited by noise and imperfections in the driving laser system. To address this, we propose and numerically demonstrate a method for designing robust Raman pulses using the Krotov quantum optimal control algorithm. We establish a theoretical model for the atom-laser interaction and detail the implementation of the Krotov method to optimize the temporal shape of the pulse's amplitude and phase. Numerical simulations indicate that, compared to standard pulses, the optimized pulses maintain high atomic manipulation fidelity over an extended range of laser frequency detunings and intensity fluctuations. Furthermore, in simulations of a full interferometer sequence, this robustness translates to a significant enhancement in the final fringe contrast under a systematic detuning. This work demonstrates that quantum optimal control is a promising pathway for suppressing experimental noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio and precision of next-generation atomic sensors.

Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light-matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits, making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius $r_\mathrm{p}$, constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of $r_\mathrm{p}$ from recent measurements of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen. This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S-6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of $r_\mathrm{p}$ and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result $ν^{}_{\text{2S-6P}}$ = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of $r_\mathrm{p}$ = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.

Rev. \textbf{A} 109, 033106 (2024)}] to study multielectron ionization and the formation of highly excited Rydberg states in O$_{2}^+$ driven by intense infrared laser pulses. Our model fully accounts for the Coulomb interaction between all particles, except for the Coulomb repulsion between bound electrons which is replaced by effective potentials. This replacement overcomes the hurdle of artificial autoinization. In addition, the multielectron motion is treated on an equal footing with nuclear motion, that is, electrons and nuclei are both allowed to move at the same time. We focus on triple and double ionization as well as frustrated triple and double ionization. For these processes, we identify and explain the main features of the sum of the kinetic energies of the final ion fragments resulting from the break-up of O$_{2}^+$. We also describe a physical mechanism that underlies frustrated triple ionization.

Abstract: Neutrino oscillations probe the quantum gravity interface in unique ways. While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We study spherically symmetric, self-similar wormhole solutions supported by colliding streams of negative-energy null dust, and their dynamical formation. Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole. Our analysis generalizes the formation model for static wormhole solutions proposed by Hayward and Koyama in 2004 to non-static wormhole solutions, offering a novel perspective on the formation of regular traversable wormholes.

Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation serves as the fundamental benchmark for detecting the gravitational-wave background (GWB) in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) within General Relativity (GR). However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone.

Abstract: We investigate static and dynamical spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) framework. We derive and solve the modified vacuum field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, revealing that the classical Schwarzschild geometry receives perturbative corrections scaling as $r^{-4}$. We establish that the GfE framework is consistent with current strong-field astrophysical observations. Higher-order geometric stresses inherent to the GfE vacuum drive a consistent mass-evolution profile. In the limit of large black hole mass, the theory predicts a constant background evaporation rate $ -β/24$, suggesting an inherent "entropic leakage" of the vacuum. At intermediate scales, the framework replicates the standard Hawking radiation mass-loss law as $\dot{M} \propto M^{-2}$ through a purely classical response of the modified background.

Abstract: This study offers a comprehensive reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity model with three distinct non-linear as well as novel forms employing a hybrid scale factor to depict the expansion history of the universe starting from early decelerated epoch to late-time accelerated evolution. Model parameters are rigorously constrained using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis with the help of Bayesian statistics and incorporating late-time observations from BAO and Patheon+SH0ES. The investigation of dynamical parameters such as the equation of state parameter and cosmological parameters indicates alignment with an accelerated expansion phase in both the present and late time epochs. Validation is conducted by assessing the energy conditions, verifying the feasibility of the model forms with particular emphasis on the violation of the strong energy condition that indicates dark energy dominance in modified gravity scenarios. This investigation has been instrumental in determining models that remain consistent with cosmological observations and theoretical requirements. The reconstructed forms of the model effectively mimic $Λ$CDM at late times, providing significant insights into possible extensions of general relativity and bolstering $f(T)$ gravity theory as a robust explanation for cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: In this paper we use the Newtonian gravitational potential corrected by non-liner effects to obtain new bounds on graviton mass using non-linear density wave theory (NLDW). This potential differs from the gravitational potential obtained in other modified gravity theories (e.g. the weak field limit of Yukawa gravity, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, non-local theories, $Λ$ cold dark matter..). Using this model, we are able to define wavelength of the non-linear wave as an analytical solution of integrable non-linear differential equation (namely, non-linear Schrodinger equation). Assuming that the wavelength of the non-linear wave represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we have found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. We compare obtained result with first assessments of LIGO $\&$ Virgo collaboration and we find they are in a good agreement. Present model used to determine the upper limit of graviton mass is completely independent from other methods published until now. We have compared our result with results obtained using several chosen published methods.

Abstract: We study scalar perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole embedded in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and demonstrate that the radial Klein Gordon equation exhibits an emergent conformal structure. The smooth traversable throat induces a logarithmic tortoise coordinate that allows the radial equation to be recast as the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue equation, paralleling the hidden conformal symmetry of the rotating Kerr black hole but arising here in a horizonless geometry. The AdS-Teo spacetime possesses two disconnected timelike AdS conformal boundaries that remain causally connected through the wormhole throat, in contrast to the two-sided eternal AdS black hole where horizons play a central role. Using the emergent conformal symmetry, we construct the near-throat generators, derive the effective potential, and obtain a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum determined by regularity at the throat and standard AdS boundary conditions at infinity. The AdS embedding further enables a minimal holographic interpretation. As an explicit illustration, we compute an equal-time two-point function in the large-Delta (geodesic) limit from a regulated spacelike geodesic that traverses the wormhole, showing how the bulk geometry couples the two asymptotic boundaries. Together, these results provide a unified description of hidden conformal structure, spectral properties, and boundary correlators in a rotating, horizonless asymptotically AdS wormhole.

Motivation: The paper builds on previous work by Koide and van de Venn, aiming to explore torsion's role in quantum fluctuations and its implications for cosmology.

Method: The authors use a combination of Metric-Affine Gravity (which includes torsion) and the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) to model quantum fluctuations and analyze their effects.

Result: Torsion affects both spin and spinless degrees of freedom, contributing to non-linear quantum mechanics. The study also reveals a connection between SVM and information geometry, hinting at broader applications in gravity theories.

Conclusion: The interplay between torsion and quantum fluctuations, along with the link to information geometry, suggests promising avenues for future research in gravity and cosmology.

Abstract: This review paper comprehensively examines the influence of spatial torsion on quantum fluctuations from the perspectives of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) and the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM). We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schrödinger equation. Finally, we discuss the structural parallelism between SVM and information geometry, highlighting that the splitting of time derivatives in stochastic processes corresponds to the dual connections in statistical manifolds. These insights pave the way for future extensions to gravity theories involving non-metricity and are expected to deepen our understanding of unresolved cosmological problems.

Conclusion: Mimetic Gravity作为解决现代物理问题的重要工具，尽管 faces挑战如梯度和 Ghost 不稳定性，但仍具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: Mimetic gravity has emerged as a compelling extension of General Relativity (GR), originally motivated by the attempt to isolate the conformal degree of freedom of the gravitational field. By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, φ)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\Box φ)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Hořava gravity. Finally, we discuss the role of the mimetic field in the early universe, specifically in the context of asymptotically free gravity and the resolution of the self-reproduction problem in inflation.

Conclusion: 通过影形态的变化，该研究为识别紧凑物提供了新的diagnotic工具。

Abstract: We investigate the shadow cast by a rotating traversable wormhole in the Teo class endowed with a general redshift function, with particular emphasis on the emergence of cuspy structures. The shadow boundary is the common envelope of two critical orbit families: unstable circular orbits outside the throat and orbits at the throat itself. The formation of cusps, marking the transition between smooth and cuspy shadow boundaries, only becomes possible when the redshift parameter $λ$ is allowed to vary. Moreover, we uncover a universal critical value $λ_c$ that signals the onset of the cusp. A phase diagram characterized by the spin and redshift parameters reveals four distinct morphologies: smooth, cuspy, ears touching, and throat drowning. The morphology of the wormhole shadow may provide observational diagnostics for the different compact objects in future high-resolution imaging observations.

Motivation: 研究引力波的量子状态和演化，特别是不同频率范围内的模式行为，是重要且基础的理论和应用课题。通过分析 relic 引力波的初始状态和量子性质，将有助于理解宇宙早期的量子引力效应及其对当前宇宙结构和演化的影响。

Method: 研究采用分析不同波长引力波在 Hubble 线长度交点时量子态的性质，考虑它们的能量密度和相互作用。利用傅里叶分析和功率谱理论，对初值态是否为真空进行了比较，并推断其对功率谱的影响。层次法和一致性检验是主要内容的方法。

Conclusion: 研究结论为宇宙早期引力量子效应提供重要信息，指出引力波在不同频段的量子行为，以及初始态对结果的微弱影响。特别是在 kHz 到 THz 的区间内，量子效应显著，并且高阶频段依赖于最初强大的 Hawking 温度。这些发现为检验量子引力理论和理解宇宙演化提供了新的视角。

Abstract: After distinguishing the role of classical and quantum inhomogeneities in cosmological backgrounds, we constrain the initial states of the relic gravitons as soon as the different wavelengths of the spectrum cross the comoving Hubble radius, without any reference to earlier timescales. According to this pragmatic perspective the quantum states with finite energy density at the crossing time consistently affect the two-point functions and the related power spectra. An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum. The non classical correlations are expected to dominate between the kHz and the THz since in this region gravitons are produced quantum mechanically with a negligible contribution from the initial state.

Method: The authors assume the synthetic null energy condition (NEC) and introduce a new trappedness condition called 'synthetically asymptotically regular'. The focus is on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the generalization to weighted cases.

Result: The main result is the generalization of the Gannon-Lee theorem under these conditions, showing that the theorem holds for weighted cases. This indicates potential for applying the theorem to spacetimes with lower regularity.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for further extensions of the Gannon-Lee theorem to low regularity spacetimes, suggesting applicability in scenarios where classically strict conditions are not met.

Abstract: We prove the Gannon-Lee incompleteness theorem for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. We assume the synthetic null energy condition of Ketterer and a trappedness condition we call "synthetically asymptotically regular". Our result generalizes this classical result to the weighted case. It also motivates and indicates extensions to low regularity, which are deferred to future work.

Conclusion: Λ(t)CDM模型更适合解释观测数据，强调随时间和相互作用的cosmological常数变化。

Abstract: We investigated a time-varying cosmological constant model using recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, combined with Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon$^{+}$, DES-Dovekie, and Union3) and CMB shift parameters, to constrain the $Λ(t)$CDM model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. We find that the interaction term $Q(z)$ shows a sign change for all dataset combinations by crossing $Q(z)=0$, depending on the choice of the dataset: at low redshift $Q(z)<0$, indicating vacuum energy decaying into dark matter, while at high redshift $Q(z)>0$, corresponding to dark matter decaying into vacuum energy. The dynamical system analysis found three critical points, namely $P_1,P_2$, and $P_3$ respectively. The resulting critical points, determined by the underlying cosmological parameters, correspond to distinct epochs in cosmic evolution. Depending on the parameter combinations, these points characterize various cosmological phases, ranging from an accelerated stiff matter-dominated era to late-time accelerated expansion. The stability of each critical point is analyzed using linear stability theory, with the relevant physical constraints on the cosmological parameters duly incorporated throughout the analysis. For each dataset combinations, the $Λ(t)$CDM model predicts that $ω_0 > -1$, showing a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant scenario with $ω_0 = -1$. Consequently, the model exhibits a transition phase in the range $N \equiv \log a(t) \approx -0.51$ to $-0.48$ and predicts $q_0$ in the range $-0.54$ to $-0.52$, with the precise transition point depending on the choice of dataset. Finally, the Bayesian evidence shows strong support for the $Λ(t)$CDM model over $Λ$CDM

Abstract: In this paper, we address a foundational challenge in quantum field theory on curved spacetime by developing a consistent framework within loop quantum gravity. We introduce a methodology for defining meaningful superpositions of quantum geometry and matter states. This is achieved by identifying a restricted subspace of the gravitational phase space, which ensures unitary equivalence among Fock representations of a scalar field across different quantum geometries. Within the resulting well-defined state space, we derive weak solutions to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. Furthermore, we generalize the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state to this quantum geometric framework. The resulting state exhibits the inherent entanglement between geometry and matter, which arises from the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. This work establishes a principled framework for studying geometry-matter entanglement and offers new insights into the quantum foundations of the black hole information paradox.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel quantum effect wherein particle spectra show extra broadening due to local short-time acceleration (as well as in a deSitter spacetime background). This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent.

Abstract: There has been recent progress in developing well-posed theories of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and of gravitational effective field theories. These have in common the feature that they introduce unphysical degrees of freedom. We address the problem of how these should be treated. We propose a ''reduction of order'' approach which is applied not at the level of equations of motion but only to initial data. This specifies uniquely the data for the unphysical modes in terms of the data for the physical modes. We argue that the apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance associated with this approach is not a problem provided one restricts to Lorentz frames for which the assumptions of effective field theory are manifestly valid.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can shed light on the currently unknown dense matter equation of state. The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors.

Abstract: We identify a fundamental tension between the standard formulation of CP violation and diffeomorphism invariance in general relativity. The effective Hamiltonian approach, while phenomenologically successful, relies on a preferred time foliation that is incompatible with general covariance. The CP-violating phases are scalars along the worldline of the decaying parent particle; however, the definition of masses and phases presupposes a local covariant structure, which becomes ill-defined near the origin where curvature is large and metric fluctuations become significant. We propose an information-geometric framework based on relative entropy, exploiting pure quantum states in particle and antiparticle Hilbert spaces. We show how the Sakharov conditions could be reinterpreted in terms of information-geometric quantities, although a fully rigorous phenomenological implementation remains to be developed.

Abstract: We generalize our previous theorem for FLRW spacetime within the framework of generic metric gravity theories. In our earlier work, we demonstrated that, in the absence of matter fields, the field equations of any generic gravity theory reduce to the Einstein field equations with an effective perfect fluid source. In the present study, we extend this analysis by incorporating scalar and vector fields into a generic gravity theory and show that the resulting field equations remain equivalent to the Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid distribution. We further verify our findings by explicitly examining recently developed Einstein-scalar and Einstein-Proca field theories.

Motivation: 使用金暗s波浪形式（GW）源进行Hubble常数H_0的精确测量是天文学的重要目标，这些波浪形式源具有强烈引力波信号且无电磁伴随物，适合高精度测量。

Method: 研究方法包括搭建一个由二黑子组成的合成人口群体，与XG级探测器时期的分析框架相结合。通过比较现成的波形模型与数值相对论为基础的参考信号，量化波形模型化和数据分析中的系统误差，评估这些误差对视界距离估计、 host galaxy关联以及单事件H_0推断的影响。

Result: 结果显示，即使当前的波形模型足以恢复统计上一致的H_0后验概率，但微小的波形 induce偏移仍然会导致三维定位和host galaxy排名的显著偏差，有时甚至导致错误的红移分配。此外，研究还推导出探测器校准准确性对金暗s波浪形式观测所需的基本要求，以确保校准系统误差在后期探测器的金暗s波浪形式观测中占主导地位。为了实现亚百分比的H_0测量，需要通过提高信号到噪声比的平方关系的量级来改进波形模型、数值相对论和探测器校准。

Abstract: Golden dark sirens - exceptionally well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts - offer a powerful route to precision measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with next-generation (XG) detectors. The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\mathcal{O}(ρ^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era.

Motivation: Constructing Gödel-like solutions in non-relativistic gravity to explore spacetime structures and dynamics.

Result: Exact solutions describing rotating universes without CTCs, relying on $D(x) > H(x)$ condition.

Conclusion:  significant contribution to understanding non-relativistic gravity, suggesting novel spacetime geometries with unique properties.

Abstract: The article deals with Gödel-like solutions in the context of Galilean gravity, a geometric formulation of non-relativistic gravitation defined on a five-dimensional Galilean manifold. Within this framework, non-relativistic matter fields admit a covariant description, while the physical Newtonian dynamics is recovered through an immersion into the usual $3+1$ spacetime. By adopting a Gödel-like metric ansatz and coupling the gravitational field to a Galilean fluid derived from a variational principle, we obtain a system of highly nonlinear and coupled field equations. Exact solutions are constructed by fixing the matter sector consistently with the field equations. The resulting configurations describe rotating non-relativistic universes and satisfy $D(x)>H(x)$ throughout the entire spatial domain. As a consequence, the associated Killing vector remains spacelike everywhere and no closed timelike curves arise.

Abstract: Strong coupling in wave-based systems often causes level repulsion, leading to mode splitting and reduced response at the target frequency. This problem is pronounced in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where strong mutual inductance between a receive coil (RC) and a metamaterial (MM) degrades B1 performance. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian complex-coupling decoupling strategy based on a dual-resonator model. By engineering a phase delay in the coupling pathway, an imaginary coupling component is created, driving the system from the PT-symmetric to the anti-PT-symmetric phase and enabling eigenmode degeneracy without added dissipation. Implemented through a high-permittivity ceramic layer, this mechanism restores single-mode resonance in the MM - RC system and suppresses frequency splitting. Simulations show a ~14-fold B1 enhancement compared with the strongly repulsive regime. This passive, compact, and hardware-compatible approach offers a general route for coupling control in electromagnetic, acoustic, optical, and quantum systems.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the investigation of optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics, particularly in the presence of external electromagnetic fields, aiming to understand phase shifts, wave propagation, and related phenomena such as the Goos-Hänchen effect and Kerr rotation.

Method: The authors revisit solutions for refractive indices in ModMax electrodynamics under uniform magnetic and electric fields, derive propagating modes and phase shifts for plane waves in magnetic fields, analyze the Goos-Hänchen effect at an interface described by ModMax, and discuss complex Kerr rotation with electric and magnetic background fields in two distinct scenarios.

Result: The study reveals that the γ parameter and the (B/E) ratio and their reciprocals are crucial in determining the Kerr signals, including rotation and ellipticity, of systems influenced by non-linear electromagnetic effects.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of optical phenomena in ModMax electrodynamics, highlighting the significance of the γ parameter and the (B/E) ratio in understanding and predicting Kerr rotation and related effects in such systems.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics (ModMax) in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Considering uniform and constant magnetic and electric backgrounds, the solutions for the refractive indices are revisited. Using these results, we obtain the propagating modes and the phase shift (birefringence) for plane wave solutions in the presence of a pure magnetic background field. Afterwards, we investigate the Goos-Hänchen effect considering the interface between a simple dielectric and a medium whose electromagnetic response tensors are ruled by the ModMax electrodynamics. Further, based on the general reflection problem, we discuss the complex Kerr rotation with both the electric $(E)$ and magnetic $(B)$ background fields, considering two main cases: i) $B>E$ and ii) $E>B$. Our findings indicate that the $γ$ parameter and ratios $(B/E)$ and $(E/B)$ play a central role in describing the Kerr signals (rotation and ellipticity) of systems with optical effects induced by non-linear electromagnetic effects.

Abstract: Radiative defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are active in a broad spectral range from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. Representatives of these defects act as bright single photon sources, spin-1 systems, and multiproperty atomic-scale sensors. They are predominantly investigated in bulk hBN films, where defects are decoupled from surface and interfacial effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of surface defects optically active in the green/yellow visible spectral range, which exhibit photophysical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts. High-power resonant laser illumination quenched the emission from the ensemble of such defects, which was attributed to a light-driven structural reconfiguration. The quenched defects were found to recover their emissive capabilities via a thermal cycling process, revealing an activation energy of 24.5 meV for the structural transition. Alternatively, permanent quenching of the defects was triggered by surface chemistry, involving lithiation-enabled attachment of functional groups. These mechanisms were utilized to realize negative-contrast direct laser writing, designing arbitrary geometric emissive patterns on demand in a microscopic configuration. The surface-active radiative centers in hBN appear particularly attractive for exploring environmental sensitivity, surface science, and coupling to photonic structures or electronic devices by taking unique advantage of the two-dimensional characteristics of the host lattice.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is scalable quantum information processing using classical optics, particularly photonic Ising machines.

Method: This paper introduces a high-precision full-aperture calibration scheme that performs wavefront retrieval and correction with < λ/40 accuracy, together with wavefront-based SLM compensation and a novel interaction-normalization method for uniform coupling representation.

Result: The result is a high-fidelity SPIM architecture that overcomes scalability limits and enables larger, more reliable photonic Ising computations.

Conclusion: This work opens a new direction for scaling up photonic quantum information processing machinery using classical optics, achieving computations that were previously thought impossible.

Abstract: Ising machines are emerging as a powerful physical alternative to digital processors for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Among them, spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) offer compact, room-temperature hardware with inherently parallel, energy efficient, single-shot optical evaluation of the Ising Hamiltonian. However, scalability has been fundamentally limited by optical aberrations and non-uniform illumination, which corrupt phase-based spin encoding and distort coupling representation, forcing operation to a restricted spatial light modulator (SLM) region. Here we introduce a high-precision full-aperture calibration scheme that overcomes these constraints. By implementing wavefront retrieval and correction with < λ/40 accuracy, we restore faithful phase encoding across the entire SLM area. Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction-normalization method, which compensates for amplitude curvature and enables uniform coupling representation. Together, these advances establish a high-fidelity, full-area SPIM architecture that unlocks true scalability and enables larger and more reliable photonic Ising computations.

Abstract: We report a high-energy, bidirectional, dissipative soliton mode-locked fiber laser operating in the 1550 nm normal-dispersion regime. By leveraging intracavity dispersion management and a Lyot filtering mechanism, the laser achieves flat-top optical spectra with 10-dB bandwidths exceeding 20 nm in both directions. Single-pulse energies of 2.7 nJ and 1.5 nJ are achieved for the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, respectively. Furthermore, the all-fiber configuration exhibits superior noise performance and inherent common-mode noise suppression. To facilitate broadband and high-speed dual-comb spectroscopy, we employ a dynamic repetition rate difference control technique via pump power modulation, enabling zero-crossing dynamic scanning. This approach achieves a spectral measurement bandwidth of approximately 16 nm at an acquisition rate of 500 Hz. Compared to static operation, this represents a nearly two-order-of-magnitude improvement in acquisition speed and achieves a fivefold measurement bandwidth beyond the Nyquist aliasing limit. Experimental results demonstrate that the system maintains robust coherence even under dynamic modulation. By implementing a phase-correction algorithm, a mutual coherence time of 0.5 s is successfully achieved, yielding a spectral resolution exceeding 7.2 GHz. This work fills a gap in high-energy dissipative soliton dual-comb sources at 1550 nm and provides an ideal solution for low-cost, high-sensitivity dual-comb spectroscopy requiring both broad bandwidth and high speed.

Abstract: The optical frequency comb has made a significant impact in precision spectroscopy and on our ability to probe atomic, molecular and, recently, nuclear transitions to further our understanding of their fundamental properties and how their dynamics and complex interactions affect the observed world. To expand the energy scales and types of systems that can be studied, frequency comb sources from terahertz to vacuum ultraviolet frequencies and beyond have been pursued. Dual-comb spectroscopy, enabled by the development of these frequency comb sources, allows broadband absorption measurements of complicated spectra, exceeding the limitations of direct, single-comb spectroscopy. To date, however, the dual-comb approach has not been able to directly access many important transitions that lie at challenging vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate dual-comb spectroscopy in the vacuum ultraviolet utilizing intracavity high harmonic generation. This multi-harmonic source is used to measure molecular absorbance spectra at $λ=210$~nm and $λ=149$~nm from room-temperature samples of acetylene and ammonia, respectively. These measurements resolve the Doppler broadened structure of congested molecular spectra with absolute frequency accuracy. Noise contributions to the vacuum ultraviolet dual-comb spectroscopy measurements are characterized, guiding future efforts and technological development in this region.

However, the development of robust and ultracompact topological charge lasing operation remains insufficiently explored. Here, we theoretically propose a translationally deformed topological charge vortex nanocavity with a low mode volume of 0.32 $(λ/n)^3$, and experimentally demonstrate the corresponding lasing emission with a low lasing threshold of around 0.74 $μ$W. The designed topological nanocavity, constructed by translationally deformed photonic crystals, supports an ultracompact optical mode carrying a topological charge characterized by polarization winding. The well-defined topological charge characteristics of the fabricated device are revealed in both near- and far-field polarization-resolved optical profiles. Our work opens a promising avenue for versatile topological photonic integration and gives new potential for exploring intriguing structured light-matter interactions under the topological photonics scenario.

Abstract: The design of high-performance optical systems remains a specialized domain gated by the limited availability of expert engineers, creating a bottleneck that stalls innovation despite the growing demand for imaging hardware. While deep learning has improved parameter optimization, it has yet to address the fundamental challenge of conceptualizing valid optical architectures from functional requirements. Here, we present an end-to-end generative framework that couples the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a differentiable ray-tracing engine to democratize the synthesis of diffraction-limited optical prescriptions. By treating optical design as a semantic-to-physical translation task, the system autonomously interprets prompts ranging from high-level end-user requests to rigorous technical specifications. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across three distinct regimes: (1) finite-conjugate industrial metrology systems, where the model autonomously enforces application-specific constraints such as telecentricity to achieve diffraction-limited performance; (2) a suite of infrared objectives (NIR, SWIR, and LWIR), demonstrating the framework's ability to synthesize valid topologies and optical prescriptions for non-visible spectral bands, and (3) complex aspheric mobile lenses, where the system successfully navigates the high-dimensional optimization landscape to produce high-resolution designs suitable for modern sensors. Validated against industry-standard simulation tools, these results establish a new paradigm for automated optical engineering, bridging the gap between semantic intent and physical realization.

Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems are pivotal for precise distance and velocity measurement, yet widespread deployment requires solutions that balance their performance, robustness, and simplicity. Here, we propose a novel chaotic LiDAR system based on a semiconductor vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback. By exploiting the intrinsic competition between the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, the system generates a polarization-multiplexed dynamics: a chaotic TM mode serves as the reference, while a feedback-modulated TE mode probes the target. This all-in-one source eliminates the need for external optical modulators or complex coherent detection. The system's dynamics is finely tunable via a half-wave ($λ$/2) plate in the feedback loop and the laser injection current, enabling real-time optimization of the cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results demonstrate precise linear ranging with a resolution of approximately 1.2 cm. Furthermore, the system exhibits strong inherent resistance to external optical interference, maintaining accurate ranging even in the presence of a secondary laser source. This compact, tunable, and interference-resilient platform offers a promising pathway toward low-cost, high-performance LiDAR for applications in autonomous navigation, robotics, and industrial metrology.

Abstract: Spectral and spatial fringes in polarized light are produced by the interference of transmitted and reflected waves at the interface between materials with different indexes of refraction. These instrumental artifacts can affect the accuracy of optical designs conceived for high-sensitivity spectroscopy and polarimetry. We review the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for these artifacts and the possible design pathways that allow us to mitigate them. In order to do so, we also present an approximate treatment of the problem of the transmission and reflection of light through (possibly absorptive) birefringent layers, relying on a few fundamental results that can be found in the already extensive literature on the subject. Unfortunately, many of these results remain the domain of a niche of investigators working in the field of thin films and optical coatings, and are often overlooked even by experienced designers of spectro-polarimetric instrumentation. The treatment presented in this work is limited to isotropic materials and uniaxial crystals, which are the most common types of optics employed in polarimetric instrumentation, and it fundamentally relies on the approximation of small birefringence for its implementation. An extensive set of modeling examples is provided to highlight the salient characteristics of polarization fringes, as well as to assess how approximate treatments such as this compare to exact but more computational expensive formulations of the problem such as Berreman's calculus.

Abstract: The manipulation of optical properties, including reflection, refraction, polarization, phase, and frequency, has long been central to advancing photonic and optoelectronic technologies. However, existing electro-optical approaches rely on volatile mechanisms that require continuous power consumption. Here, we demonstrate strong, nonvolatile modulation of optical dispersion in monolayer tungsten disulfide (ML WS2) using patterned ferroelectric domains in aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). By locally poling ferroelectric domains into opposite states, we achieve substantial manipulation of the complex refractive index (Delta n > 0.7, Delta k > 0.4) and excitonic energy shifts (~50 meV) in ML WS2, comparable to previous gate-tuning approaches while eliminating continuous power consumption. We introduce an asymmetric screening model that reveals how ferroelectric polarization induces carrier-density-dependent Coulomb screening, leading to distinct excitonic behaviors between electron- and hole-doped regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate a gate-free lateral p-n homojunction with a rectification ratio of 6e10^3, formed through spatial carrier redistribution. These findings establish ferroelectric/2D heterostructures as a powerful platform for nonvolatile optical dispersion engineering, enabling energy-efficient, reconfigurable photonic and optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Structured light beams with space-variant polarization can be efficiently generated using voltage-tunable nematic liquid-crystal (Q-plate). By appropriately selecting the input state and the retardation of the Q-plate, an optical field acquires a spatially structured polarization distribution that is capable of encoding non-trivial topological information across the beam profile. These features can be directly read out through interaction with plasmonic nano-structures, such as circular and spiral slits. Here we show that, upon illumination, polarization-dependent excitation of surface plasmons converts the hidden topology of the polarization structure into observable intensity distributions, including plasmonic vortices and characteristic interference patterns, while the tunability of the input parameters enables a rich variety of distinct topological forms.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) constitutes a key basement structure to human organisms by acting as a complex network of large proteins and carbohydrates that provide structural support to surrounding cells. Remodeling in the extracellular matrix's structural fibers leads to insight into the development of diseases such as cancer, fibrosis and carcinoma. While standard tissues visualization in the ECM involves multiple lengthy histopathological staining protocols, Mueller matrix-based polarimetry provides label-free tissue slices' microstructural information and optical properties. This work aims to identify three types of fiber tissues commonly found in the ECM of gastrointestinal tissue specimens by analyzing their polarization properties. To address decomposition methods' reliance on restrictive hypotheses and inability with an individual polarization-based parameter to determine the nature of a given biological tissue; this study employs Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method to offer greater discriminative power and flexibility. Subsequently, polarization-based features will be extracted and compared between fiber regions statistically to discern potential diagnostic differences. By providing colorized images, this work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of distinguishing different fibers with polarization approach, offering insights for future clinical development while complementing existing staining methods for pathological tissue specimens.

Abstract: We present a two-well terahertz (THz) quantum cascade laser designed for high temperature operation based on the InGaAs/AlInAs material system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores practical limits of Zernike phase-contrast imaging while maintaining theoretical quantum Fisher information limits.

Method: Used a finite incident beam and finite phase cutoff, and for a speckle beam, an approximate method to achieve a similar system performance.

Result: Despite practical constraints, >95% of the quantum limit is achievable.

Conclusion: Zernike phase-contrast imaging can approach quantum limits in real scenarios, expanding its practical applications.

Abstract: Zernike phase-contrast imaging is unique among imaging techniques in that it enables the upper limit of Fisher information allowed by quantum mechanics. Here we show that, in a departure from an ideal setting, using an incident beam of finite width, and a $π/2$ phase plate having a finite cutoff, the technique can still deliver $>95\%$ of the quantum limit. We point out that the Zernike method is, in principle, applicable to any incident beam. As an example, we sketch an approximate implementation of the method for an incident speckle beam, and show that it too can deliver $>95\%$ of the quantum limit.

TL;DR: The paper presents NIR-LDHM, a lensless digital holographic microscopy extension to near-infrared wavelengths with improved performance in scattering media compared to visible wavelengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Holographic microscopy faces limitations in turbid samples, so extending it to near-infrared may enable better performance. NIR imaging typically requires longer wavelengths and is less computationally intensive.

Method: The authors used a CMOS sensor and tested with tissue mimicking milk and calibration targets. They analyzed performance across wavelengths, scattering strength, and distances.

Result: NIR-LDHM shows better resolution beyond 1.4 mm in scattering media, achieves reconstructions under low light, and extends lateral resolution by moving samples 9 mm farther.

Conclusion: NIR-LDHM overcomes visible regime limitations and shows promise for biophotonics applications with minimal hardware changes.

Abstract: Lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) relies on interference between an unscattered reference wave and a weakly scattered object wave - an assumption that rapidly fails in turbid samples under multiple scattering. To overcome this limitation, we present near-infrared LDHM (NIR-LDHM), a in-line holographic platform that operates up to the silicon cutoff (~1100 nm) using a conventional board-level CMOS sensor designed for visible (VIS) imaging. Using tissue-mimicking milk scattering layers and calibrated resolution targets, we quantify reconstruction performance versus wavelength, scattering strength, and sample-sensor distance. NIR-LDHM maintains resolvable features through scattering layers up to ~1.4 mm, whereas visible regime fails to resolve features below ~350 um. Importantly, despite a detector quantum efficiency of only 0.19% at 1100 nm, robust reconstructions are obtained under low-photon-budget conditions. We further identify advantageous mechanism by which increasing the sample-sensor distance from ~3 to 12 mm improves lateral resolution by twofold under strong scattering. Finally, we demonstrate wide-field, label-free amplitude-phase imaging of uncleared mouse tissues, resolving internal structure in brain and liver slices up to ~250 um and ~60 um, respectively. By extending lensless complex-field microscopy into strongly scattering regimes with minimal hardware changes, this work has relevance to computational imaging through complex media and biophotonics.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: An improved method for calculating guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibers is developed, addressing the limitations of standard textbook methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accurate calculation of guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibers is essential for applications in nanophotonics, including quantum interfaces and vectorial light sensing. However, standard methods may introduce significant errors due to the ill-conditioned problem of determining field amplitudes.

Method: The original method relies on solving a 4×4 matrix eigenvalue problem. The new semi-analytical method starts from the symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and analytically reduces the problem to a 2×2 system, eliminating the need for numerically unstable null space calculations.

Result: The new method provides a more reliable and accurate way to calculate the full vectorial field structure of guided modes in optical nanofibers, overcoming the limitations of the standard approach and ensuring precise knowledge of field polarizations, particularly the longitudinal components.

Conclusion: This advancement offers a powerful tool for the design and analysis of nanofiber-based devices in nanophotonics and related fields.

Abstract: The accurate calculation of guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibres is critical for applications in nanophotonics, from quantum interfaces to vectorial light sensing. Standard textbook methods rely on solving a $4\times4$ matrix eigenvalue problem to find the modal fields. While widely used, this approach has a subtle but significant flaw: the final determination of the field amplitudes requires finding the numerical null space of a theoretically singular matrix, an ill-conditioned problem that introduces large relative errors in the small but physically crucial longitudinal field components. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally more robust and efficient semi-analytical method. By starting from the foundational symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and employing a judicious normalisation of the field amplitudes, we demonstrate that the problem can be analytically reduced to a much simpler $2\times2$ system. This reformulation yields two decisive advantages: the dispersion relation is obtained numerically from a simple and well-behaved transcendental equation, and more importantly, the modal field amplitudes are subsequently determined \emph{analytically}. Our approach completely bypasses the numerical null space calculation, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the full vectorial field structure. This method provides a powerful and reliable tool for the design and analysis of nanofibre-based devices, particularly for applications in chiral quantum optics and nanophotonics where precise knowledge of field polarisation and specifically of the longitudinal components is paramount.
