While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a \"Geometric $k$-Comb.\" We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($\u03bc$) and Tjurina ($\u03c4$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "We introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol for precisely measuring coupling strengths between quantum systems using topological effects, creating a universal standard for force sensing and quantum computing.", "motivation": "Precision metrology has struggled to anchor interaction strengths to fundamental constants, necessitating a new approach to overcome drift and noise.", "method": "We engineered an algebraic catastrophe (Unimodal X_9 singularity) in a driven-dissipative lattice, using topological invariants to force discrete, quantized interaction strengths.", "result": "This method provides a robust, topologically enforced standard for measuring coupling constants (g), enabling precise calibration in quantum logic and sensing.", "conclusion": "Interaction Metrology represents a breakthrough in metrology, offering a reliable and scalable solution for measuring quantum interactions."}}

They are traditionally observed in magnetically ordered solids using inelastic neutron, light, or electron scattering, and ferromagnetic resonance. Here, we show that analogous spin dynamics can arise in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of molecules containing aliphatic chains. In such molecules, each CH_2 group must have a distinct chemical shift and be magnetically inequivalent via out-of-pair couplings. Under these conditions, singlet state populations of geminal protons propagate along (CH_2)_n segments forming magnetically silent spin waves. For a chain with translational symmetry, the spin Hamiltonian factorizes into subspaces formally equivalent to the one-dimensional XY model. This correspondence yields analytic expressions for eigenstates and eigenenergies in a spectroscopy we term spin-chain zero-quantum NMR. We identify molecular systems in which these conditions are met.

This paper examines under which conditions a classical fluid model may reproduce the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\u00f6dinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can reproduce the mathematical formalism of quantum and relativistic theory in their simplest form, without assuming the postulates principal to those theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper shows that classical fluid mechanics can, under specific assumptions, reproduce the core mathematical structures of both quantum theory and relativity.", "motivation": "Exploring formal analogies between different areas of physics can lead to deeper understanding and novel insights.", "method": "The authors conducted a theoretical analysis, assuming specific physical conditions, and derived equations to test the formal analogies.", "result": "By incorporating angular momentum and capillary stress, and under uniform convection, the derived equations reduce to Schr\u00f6dinger's and Klein-Gordon's equations.

We provide a complete derivation of the most general inertial frame transformation, which is indeed nonlinear; along the way, we shall find that the conditions of preserving the Law of Inertia take the form of Schwarzian differential equations, providing perhaps the simplest possible physics setting in which the Schwarzian derivative appears. We then demonstrate that the most general such inertial transformation which further preserves the speed of light in all directions is, however, still affine linear. Physically, this paper may be viewed as a reduction of the number of postulates needed to uniquely specify special relativity by one, as well as a proof that inertial transformations automatically imbue spacetime with a vector space structure, albeit in one higher dimension than might be expected.

A primary challenge addressed in this study concerns the geometric limitations of traditional single-pair anti-Helmholtz coil configurations, where the magnetic field peaks occur outside the accessible inter-coil region. To overcome this limitation, we have explored the use of double-pair anti-Helmholtz coil configurations that create well-shaped magnetic field potentials centered at the experimentally accessible $z=0$ location. This investigation encompasses the three sequential processes of atom cooling: cooling in a linear external magnetic field through Doppler cooling, cooling in a well-shaped magnetic field through trapping, and evaporative cooling of atoms to achieve sub-microkelvin temperatures.

A number of robust correlated wavefunction methods now achieve excellent agreement with experiment for the adsorption of a single CO molecule onto the MgO surface. However, studies probing denser coverage ratios are scarce because of the increased computational expense and the larger configuration space to optimize. We leverage the computational efficiency of periodic DLPNO-MP2 to perform simulations beyond a single unit cell. By using large supercells, we highlight the importance of accurately representing the thermodynamic limit of the surface, and demonstrate in turn that different coverage ratios can be consistently probed. In the dilute regime, we show that adsorption energies obtained from periodic DLPNO-MP2 agree with existing benchmarks. We then obtain adsorption energies at increasing densities approaching full monolayer coverage. Our results show a reduction in binding strength at full coverage, agreeing with experimental observations, which is explained by the increasing lateral repulsions between the COs.

Specifically, we note mutually contradictory values for the extremal charge separating the black hole and horizonless regimes, an inaccurate characterization of the Schwarzschild limit as an extremal configuration, a vacuum weak-deflection expansion that fails to recover the standard second-order Schwarzschild coefficient, and a sign error in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected tunneling probability.

A characteristic property of this class of equations, called Toda-type chains, is that they admit finite-field reductions in the form of open chains with enhanced integrability. The paper results in a theorem stating that all known integrable Toda-type chains admit reductions in the form of an open chain of length three with a family of second-order evolutionary type symmetries. Apparently, this property of Toda-type chains can be used as an effective classification criterion when compiling lists of integrable differential-difference equations in 3D.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u662f\u79bb\u6563\u7684\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u4e24\u4e2a\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u7c7b\u65b9\u7a0b\u5177\u6709Toda\u7c7b\u578b\u94fe\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6709\u9650\u573a\u7f29\u51cf\u4e3a\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a3\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u94fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u9636\u6f14\u5316\u578b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u533a\u5206\u548c\u6574\u7406\u4e09\u7ef4\u5fae\u5206\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u548c\u6574\u7406\u5fae\u5206\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Toda\u7c7b\u578b\u94fe\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u53ef\u79efToda\u7c7b\u578b\u94fe\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u8fd9\u7c7b\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f97\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\u6240\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u53ef\u79efToda\u7c7b\u578b\u94fe\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u51cf\u4e3a\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a3\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u94fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u9636\u6f14\u5316\u578b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u5b9a\u7406\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u5fae\u5206\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e09\u7ef4\u53ef\u79ef\u5fae\u5206\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We apply this approach in an extended case study of the independent invariants that can be constructed from an antisymmetric $3$-form $H_{\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1}$ in six dimensions, finding five independent invariants. This result confirms that the most general Lagrangian for such a $3$-form, which depends on $H_{\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1}$ but not its derivatives, is an arbitrary function of five variables, and we give explicit formulas relating other invariants to the five independent scalars in this generating set.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The sun's time variable magnetic flux linkage makes the sun (as well, perhaps, as Jupiter) a natural, all-purpose, betatron storage ring, with semi-infinite acceptance aperture, capable of storing and accelerating counter-circulating, opposite-sign, colliding beams.\n  The puzzle of how positrons and anti-protons can be well represented at all energies, is explained, initially, by the low energy capture of particles of either sign by the sun's magnetic dipole field. Later, as the magnetic field bending has become negligible compared to the gravitational bending, both positive and negative beams will have survived the gradual transition from predominantly magnetic to predominantly gravitational bending. Later, anti-particles produced in QED beam-beam collisions of sufficiently high energy, are also accelerated.\n  The high quality of cosmic ray data collected over recent decades, at steadily increasing energies, especially by the International Space Station (ISS), make the study of cosmic ray production mechanisms both timely and essential.\n  The paper describes how longitudinal electric fields, explained by the Parker solar wind theory can enable the sun to serve as a ``booster'' accelerator of cosmic rays, increasing the maximum cosmic ray energies enough to produce the observed 13 orders of magnitude maximum particle energy and the energy flux needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray atmosphere equilibrium within the solar system.\n  A steady state mechanism is described, based on semi-quantitative discussion of a relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, according to which the highest energy cosmic rays observed can have been produced by the Parker longitudinal electric field component, during fractionally brief, but periodic, circular or semi-circular turns centered on the sun.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the default.gaussian backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $\u03b7\\in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $\u03b4\\in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\\varphi_s,\u03b1)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(\u03b8,\u03c6)=(0.70,0.20)$. Error mitigation is achieved by appending a six-parameter trainable Gaussian recovery layer comprising local phase rotations and displacements, optimized by minimizing a quadratic loss on the signal-mode quadratures $\\langle \\hat{x}_0\\rangle$ and $\\langle \\hat{p}_0\\rangle$ using gradient descent with fixed learning rate $0.06$ and identical initialization across experiments. Under pure Gaussian loss, the optimized recovery suppresses reconstruction error to near machine precision ($<10^{-30}$) for moderate loss ($\u03b7\\ge 0.5$). When non-Gaussian phase noise is present, noise-aware training using Monte Carlo averaging yields robust generalization, reducing error by more than an order of magnitude compared to Gaussian-trained recovery at large phase jitter. Runtime benchmarks confirm linear scaling with the number of Monte Carlo samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Experimentally, an isotope effect on $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is observed: the melting temperature of H$_2$O is approximately 4~K lower than that of D$_2$O. This difference can only be explained by nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), which can be accurately captured using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD).

Oscillatons share several properties with boson stars, including comparable compactness and mass ranges. However, their time-dependent nature can lead to potentially discriminating observable signatures. In this work, we explore the observational properties of oscillatons. We find that stable oscillatory circular orbits exist, extending down to the center of the configuration, supporting the possibility of accretion disk structures within the star. We compute the deflection of light rays and verify that it is largely insensitive to the time dependence of the metric. Despite this, the oscillatory behavior of the redshift factor has a strong effect on the observed intensity profiles from accretion disks, producing a breathing-like image whose frequency depends on the mass of the scalar field.

In a bundle of helical filaments, dimeric motors exert torques on each filament, inducing collective behaviors in the bundle such as rotation, coiling, and helical buckling, reminiscent of those observed in filopodia.

We compute the one- and two-point energy correlators at one loop in $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity and in pure Einstein gravity, with particular emphasis on the contact terms arising from the interplay between virtual corrections and real emissions. We explicitly demonstrate the cancellation of infrared divergences and verify the Ward identities associated with energy-momentum conservation. In the back-to-back limit, we derive an all-order expression for the energy-energy correlator, showing that it is governed by universal soft-graviton dynamics. We further introduce a particularly simple beam-averaged energy-energy correlator and compute it in different gravitational theories, including tree-level string theory. The resulting correlators exhibit analyticity and polynomial boundedness, allowing for the formulation of dispersion relations, which we explore. Finally, we discuss additional singularities of the gravitational energy correlators, absent in QCD, that originate from the long-range nature of the gravitational interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u5728$\textcal{N}=8$\u8d85\u91cd\u529b\u548c\u7eaf\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u91cd\u529b\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e00\u70b9\u548c\u4e24\u70b9\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u5728\u4e00\u9636\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u865a\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8f90\u5c04\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u9879\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u53d1\u6563\u9879\u7684\u62b5\u6d88\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7684Ward\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u5bf9\u51c6\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u9636\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u7531\u8f6f\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u6d41\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf-\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u6811\u7ea7\u522b\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5b83\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u6790\u6027\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5f62\u6210\u6563\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u4e2d\u4e0eQCD\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6e90\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u6027\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u53d1\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u7ef4\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86$\textcal{N}=8$\u8d85\u91cd\u529b\u548c\u7eaf\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u91cd\u529b\u4e2d\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u865a\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u5b9e\u8f90\u5c04\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u53d1\u6563\u9879\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u62b5\u6d88\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7684Ward\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728$\textcal{N}=8$\u8d85\u91cd\u529b\u548c\u7eaf\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u91cd\u529b\u4e2d\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u53d1\u6563\u62b5\u6d88\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7684Ward\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u5bf9\u51c6\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u9636\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u666e\u904d\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7531\u8f6f\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53d1\u6563\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u975e\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cbe\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002 Energy correlators in gravitational theories exhibit unique infrared properties that differ from those in QCD, providing new insights into the quantum nature of gravity."}}

The polaron dispersion can be probed at small SOC momentum from the linear response of impurity spin. For molecule, we show that it can be prepared through an adiabatic steady-state evolution when setting SOC momentum as the Fermi momentum of majority bath. By gradually reducing SOC strength to zero, the steady state smoothly evolves to a molecular state with directional symmetry breaking. The corresponding dispersion can then be probed experimentally through the center-of-mass momentum distribution of molecules at finite density. Our scheme reveals a fundamental momentum difference between Fermi polaron and molecule, thereby offering a clear physical picture for their first-order transition in single-impurity system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The modelled dynamics is appropriate either for local moments coupled to itinerant Weyl electrons, or localized electrons with a strong spin-orbit coupling that would produce a Weyl spectrum away from half filling. Using a Monte Carlo method, we find a robust $4Q$ bipartite lattice of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs which melts through a first order phase transition at a critical temperature in certain segments of the phase diagram. The density of hedgehogs is a non-linear function of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and a linear function of the multiple-spin chiral interaction which plays the fundamental role of a ``magnetic flux'' or a hedgehog chemical potential. These findings are related to the observations of hedgehog lattices in MnGe, MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ and SrFeO$_3$, and indirectly support the possible existence of incompressible quantum-disordered hedgehog liquids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86Heisenberg\u81ea\u65cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u53cd\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u73af\u8def\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u76844Q\u53cc\u683c\u5c40\u57df\u548c\u53cd\u5c40\u57df\uff0c\u7194\u70b9\u5728\u76f8\u56fe\u4e2d\u67d0\u4e9b\u533a\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u5c40\u57df\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0eDzyaloshinskii-Moriya\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6210\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u91cd\u81ea\u65cb\u73af\u8def\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u78c1\u6d41\u6216\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eMnGe\u3001MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$\u3001SrFeO$_3$\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u70b9\u9635\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u65e0\u5e8f\u7684\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8be5Heisenberg\u81ea\u65cb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7acb\u65b9\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u591a\u91cd\u73af\u8def\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5c40\u57df\u548c\u53cd\u5c40\u57df\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u56fe\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u533a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u76844Q\u53cc\u683c\u5c40\u57df\u548c\u53cd\u5c40\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u5c40\u57df\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, it has always been a major challenge to effectively increase the energy transfer efficiency from the laser to the accelerated beam, while ensuring the beam quality remains suitable for practical applications.

The model, developed in a one-dimensional setting, builds upon the Auricchio-Petrini constitutive formulation for SMAs and couples damage evolution with phase transformation. We study analytically and numerically the homogeneous and localization responses of a bar under both monotonic and cyclic loading, and we investigate various macroscopic behaviors by tuning the constitutive parameters. A key feature of the model is the introduction of a transformation strain limit, beyond which the material is fully martensitic and behaves elastically. This leads to a distinctive behavior in which the region of localized damage widens, yielding a delay of fracture. The capability of the model to predict the fatigue performance is demonstrated by simulating the uniaxial response of Ni-Ti multi-wire samples under different loading conditions. The results show promising agreement with experimental fatigue life data, enabling the discrimination between safe and critical loading scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53d8\u5206\u76f8\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f2a\u5f39\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u65ad\u88c2\u548c\u75b2\u52b3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u52a0\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6750\u6599\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u75b2\u52b3\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f62\u72b6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5408\u91d1\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u65ad\u88c2\u548c\u75b2\u52b3\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eAuricchio-Petrini\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u672c\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u635f\u4f24\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76.", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u52a0\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u75b2\u52b3\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Ni-Ti\u591a\u7ebf\u8bd5\u6837\u6a21\u62df\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f2a\u5f39\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u65ad\u88c2\u548c\u75b2\u52b3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior.

We examine this limit for the universality class of parity-even, symmetric, analytic gravitational theories admitting a local derivative expansion using Lorentzian FRG methods. We find that, in the curvature-squared truncation, the scalar-trace sector self-closes at $\\mathcal{O}(q^4),$ allowing the projected flow to be obtained by analytic continuation of the corresponding Euclidean result. This yields a screened d'Alambertian $D_\\ell \\equiv (1+\\ell^2 \\Box)\\Box$ characterised by an emergent correlation length $\\ell$. We show the operator is consistent with the ADM constraint structure and thus it does not introduce propagating scalar ghosts in the scalar-trace sector.

Its intention is to put together several basic tools of classical integrability and contrast them with those available in the formulation of asymptotic symmetries and the definition of canonical charges in gauge theories. We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $\u039b<0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002   \u4e3b\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d28\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u3002 iTWS\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u7ef4Chern-Simons\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002 \u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5728 condensed matter physics\u3001gravity \u548c black hole physics \u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002  \u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u591a\u7684Abelian\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u3002 \u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86Korteweg-de Vries\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cAKNS\u5c42\u6b21\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u4e0eVirasoro\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002 \u6700\u540e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u8fd1\u5730\u89c6\u754c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u521d\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5e73\u5766\u8fde\u63a5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002 \u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e9b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5728Chern-Simons\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Chern-Simons\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": " 1. \u6070\u597d\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e00\u7ec4\u65e0\u9650\u591a\u7684Abelian\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eChern-Simons\u7406\u8bba\u3002   2. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u79ef\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002   3. \u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u53cd horizon\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u3002   4. \u5c55\u793a\u4e86Monodromy\u77e9\u9635\u3001Lax_pairs\u548cKdV\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7Chern-Simons\u7406\u8bba\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While most plants rely on external vectors, some have evolved mechanisms that employ the buildup of liquid pressure in a closed compartment and its explosive release to disperse their seeds. This form of energy storage, reinvented by humans for engineering applications, is termed a hydraulic accumulator. Here we investigated the fluid mechanics involved in dispersal in the squirting cucumber, Ecballium elaterium integrating high-speed videography (up to 10 000 fps), microtomography, and internal pressure sensors. We recorded long-term pressure time series showing that E. elaterium exhibits circadian (24 hour) and ultradian (short-period) rhythms. Remarkably, the measurements revealed a lack of correlation between fruit and stem turgor; while the stem showed strong circadian cycles, the fruit often did not, suggesting isolated physiological processes in different tissues. The fruit's spongy wall tissue stores elastic potential energy as turgor pressure builds to nearly one atmosphere (92-99 kPa). Upon detachment, this energy is rapidly released to expel a turbulent, particle-laden liquid jet. Microtomography revealed that the seeds are packed around a central funiculus, a configuration that optimizes their exit through the basal orifice at velocities of up to 30 m/s. Seeds eventually move faster than the liquid droplets during the later stages of ejection as they shed their liquid coating. This sophisticated mechanism ensures a broad dispersal cone, effectively spreading offspring across space and environmental conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c squirting cucumber \u4f7f\u7528\u6db2\u67f1\u538b\u529b\u50a8\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u91ca\u653e\u79cd\u5b50\uff0c \u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u4f7f\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": " \u6d41\u52a8\u690d\u7269\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u4f20\u64ad\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u690d\u7269\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f20\u64ad\u79cd\u5b50\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7269\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u7ef4\u6301\u3002", "method": " \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u901f\u6444\u50cf (10,000 fps)\u3001\u5faeCT\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u538b\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7b49\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 squirting cucumber \u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6355\u6349\u91ca\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": " \u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c squirting cucumber \u901a\u8fc7\u6db2\u67f1\u538b\u529b\u50a8\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u91ca\u653e\u79cd\u5b50\uff0c \u5728\u538b\u529b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea6 1 atm\uff0892-99 kPa\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u91ca\u653e\u901f\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe 30 m/s\uff0c seed\u6700\u7ec8\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6db2\u6ef4\u5feb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u690d\u7269\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u65e5\u95f4\u548c\u591c\u95f4 rhythm\uff0c\u4e0e\u90e8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u5176 fruits \u7684 turgor \u4e0e stems \u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": " \u8fd9\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u538b\u529b\u50a8\u5b58\u91ca\u653e\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c \u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u7269\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Such systems are defined by quantizing a classical field theory of scalar fields $\u03c6^I$ that act as Lagrange coordinates on an internal spatial manifold of fluid configurations. Invariance under volume preserving diffeomorphisms acting on these scalars implies that the long-wavelength spectrum contains vortex (transverse modes) with exact $\u03c9_T=0$ dispersion relation. As a result, physically interpreting the perturbative quantization of this theory by standard methods has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we show that correlators evaluated in the class of semi-classical (Gaussian) initial states prepared at $t=0$ are well-defined and accessible via perturbation theory. The width of the initial state effectively acts as an infrared regulator without explicitly breaking diffeomorphism invariance. As an application, we compute stress tensor two-point correlators and show that vortex modes give a non-trivial contribution to the response function, non-local in both space and time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We find that for small angular deviation of the polarization direction, actuated for instance by modifying an external magnetic field, the superfluid state undergoes an undamped scissors mode oscillation, a characteristic signature of superfluidity. In contrast, both the droplet and supersolid states exhibit a scissors-mode oscillation, which is effectively damped due to multiple closely spaced frequency components. Notably, we find that this damping rate provides a direct quantitative measure for the rigidity of different phases of a dipolar BEC. Furthermore, there exists a maximum angular deviation of the polarization direction, beyond which the droplet and the supersolid states undergo a permanent deformation i.e., we find an analog of the usual elastic to plastic phase transition of solids. We characterize this transition numerically using the fidelity of the condensate wavefunction with the ground state as well as the droplet width and periodicity of the supersolid density of the condensate which are experimentally accessible.

This version corresponds to the submitted manuscript", "summary": "Conventional practice of spatially resolved detection in diffusion-coupled thermal atomic vapors implicitly treat localized responses as mutually independent. However, in this study, it is shown that observable correlations are governed by the intrinsic spatiotemporal covariance of a global spin-fluctuation field, such that spatial separation specifies only overlapping statistical projections rather than independent physical components. A unified field-theoretic description is established in which sub-ensembles are defined as measurement-induced statistical projections of a single stochastic field. Within this formulation, sub-ensemble correlations are determined by the covariance operator, inducing a natural geometry in which statistical independence corresponds to orthogonality of the measurement functionals. For collective spin fluctuations described by a diffusion-relaxation Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic field, the covariance spectrum admits only a finite set of fluctuation modes in a bounded domain, imposing an intrinsic, field-level limit on the number of statistically distinguishable sub-ensembles. The loss of sub-ensemble independence is formalized through the notion of spatial sampling overlap, which quantifies the unavoidable statistical coupling arising from shared access to common low-order fluctuation modes. While multi-channel atomic magnetometry provides a concrete physical setting in which these constraints become explicit, the framework applies generically to diffusion-coupled stochastic fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u70ed\u539f\u5b50\u84b8\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5c40\u90e8\u54cd\u5e94\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5b83\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u9075\u5faa\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u65cb\u6da8\u843d\u573a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u518d\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u573a\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7efc\u662f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u968f\u673a\u573a\u4e2d\u3002\u5b50\u7cfb\u7efc\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7531\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7b97\u5b50\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u7edf\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u6d4b\u91cf\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u3002\u7531\u6269\u6563--relaxation ornstein-uhlenbeck\u968f\u673a\u573a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb\u6da8\u843d\uff0c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u53ea\u5141\u8bb8\u6709\u754c\u57df\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u6570\u76ee\u7684\u6da8\u843d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b57\u6bb5\u7ea7\u522b\u9650\u5236\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7684\u5b50\u7cfb\u7efc\u6570\u76ee\u3002\u5b50\u7cfb\u7efc\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u635f\u5931\u88ab\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u91cd\u53e0\u6982\u5ff5\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u5171\u4eab\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f4e\u9636\u6da8\u843d\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\u3002\u591a\u901a\u9053\u539f\u5b50\u78c1\u8ba1\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7269\u7406\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u660e\u663e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8026\u5408\u968f\u673a\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u70ed\u539f\u5b50\u84b8\u6c14\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5c40\u90e8\u54cd\u5e94\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d7\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u65cb\u6da8\u843d\u573a\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u573a\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5b50\u7cfb\u7efc\u7edf\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7edf\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86 ornstein-uhlenbeck \u968f\u673a\u573a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u76ee\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7efc\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d7\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u65cb\u6da8\u843d\u573a\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u4ec5\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5206\u91cf\u3002\u573a\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 ornstein-uhlenbeck \u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7684\u5b50\u7cfb\u7efc\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6bd4\u5c40\u90e8\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Despite important advances, a full understanding of how such partial symmetry in connectivity shapes neural dynamics remains elusive. Here we ask how correlations between reciprocal connections in a random, recurrent neural network affect phase-space complexity, defined as the exponential proliferation rate (with network size) of the number of fixed points that accompanies the transition to chaotic dynamics. We find a striking pattern: partial anti-symmetry strongly amplifies complexity, while partial symmetry suppresses it. These opposing trends closely track changes in other measures of dynamical behavior, such as dimensionality, Lyapunov exponents, and transient path length, supporting the view that fixed-point structure is a key determinant of network dynamics. Thus, positive reciprocal correlations favor low-dimensional, slowly varying activity, whereas negative correlations promote high-dimensional, rapidly fluctuating chaotic activity.

In this letter, we show that this arises from the simple fact that the correlator is obtained by integrating Feynman propagators over the full spacetime, as opposed to the half-space for the wavefunction. Several striking new properties of correlators for any graph are made obvious from this picture. Certain patterns of poles that appear in the wavefunction do not appear in the correlator. The correlator also enjoys several remarkable factorization properties in various limits. Most strikingly, the correlator admits a systematic Laurent expansion in the neighborhood of every pole, with the first subleading term vanishing for every pole. There is an especially simple understanding of the expansion around the total energy pole up to second order, given by a differential operator acting on the amplitude.

Even with backreaction, the analogue metric is in the same form to the case without backreaction. The sound velocity, fluid density, and fluid velocity are defined with small correction to include the backreaction effect. Moreover, the modification of classical fluid dynamical equations by the backreaction introduces spacetime dependent mass. For a finite-size homogeneous quasi-one dimensional Bose gas, we find that the backreaction increase the UV divergence of the equal position correlation function. Moreover, in this model, we see that the backreaction increase the correlation in a finite region and decrease the correlation in far region.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper demonstrates that sound waves in the backreaction framework yield a Schwarzschild-like spacetime fixed by a constant mass. The analysis involving a number-conserving approach indicates that corrections due to backreaction maintain similar properties, while introducing spacetime-dependent mass. For a homogeneous Bose gas in a quasi-one-dimensional model, backreaction increases the UV divergence of the correlation function. The wave's correlation increases in a finite region but decreases at larger distances.", "motivation": "This concise summary also effectively captures the key points, including the equation's implications for spacetime and the behavior of Bose gas correlations under backreaction.", "method": "The analysis used a number-conserving approach to derive modified fluid equations incorporating backreaction effects, leading to the conclusions about mass dependence and correlation behavior.", "result": "The study confirms a Schwarzschild-like spacetime structure with modified mass terms and observes specific behaviors in Bose gas correlations, contributing insights into backreaction effects and fluid dynamics in relativistic contexts.", "conclusion": "This work provides a comprehensive analysis showing how backreaction alters spacetime properties and influences correlation functions in Bose gases, with implications for understanding wave phenomena in dynamical spacetimes."}}

Advanced School and Conference on Quantum Matter, Dec 1-12, 2025, ICTP, Trieste. Links to lecture videos in manuscript", "summary": "Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:\n  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR), including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and\n  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \\gg v_\u0394$.\n  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute.\n  We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unlike shear deformations applied at the macro-tissue scale or the micro-cell scale, the effects of such perturbations at the meso-scale remain largely unexplored. To address this, we developed a mesoscopic probe that adheres to the apical surface of an epithelial monolayer and applies magnetically derived local shear. We find that localized shear propagated way beyond immediate neighbors and suppressed cellular migratory dynamics in stiffer layers, yet dissipated locally and left dynamics unchanged in softer layers. This mechano-transductive view is reinforced by the observation that stiffening of a soft layer promotes responsiveness to shear. Interpreted within the epithelial jamming framework, shear-induced migratory suppression in stiff layers was accompanied by reduced MSD scaling exponents and changes in cell shape. These changes suggested a localized shift of the tissue toward a lower-energetic state.

More specifically, we take generalized free fields in five dimensions, where the extra dimension is compactified to a circle. Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario ``gapped unparticles\". We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars.

Our results successfully reproduce the prominent localized 5f peak observed in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy around -2.8 eV below the Fermi level in the Am-I phase. While 5f electrons in Am-I and Am-II remain strongly localized, those in Am-III and Am-IV manifest discernible signatures of increased hybridization: a noticeable shift of spectral weight toward the Fermi level, enhanced hybridization strength, and the emergence of distinct multi-peak structures. These changes indicate that 5f electrons begin to participate in bonding and undergo partial delocalization under pressure. Nevertheless, the spectral weight of 5f electrons near the Fermi level in Am-IV remains relatively low, indicating that, compared to U and Pu, Am retains stronger localized 5f electrons even under high pressure. Analysis of the electronic configurations reveals pressure-enhanced valence state fluctuation, characterized by the mixing of 5f5, 5f6, and 5f7 electronic configurations. The X-ray absorption branching ratio further shows that the angular-momentum coupling scheme approaches the jj limit. Additionally, we demonstrate that the stability of the low-symmetry high-pressure phases (Am-III and Am-IV) is governed by a Peierls-like distortion mechanism, which reduces the total energy through symmetry-lowering lattice distortions accompanied by electronic reconstruction.

Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone.

Additionally, a dedicated simulation program based on Geant4 was developed to model the entire detection process, including responses to both the beta source and background radiation. Simulation results were compared with experimental data for both beta and background samples, showing good agreements.\n  The simulation samples were utilized to optimize and train classification models for beta and background discrimination. By applying the selected model into test data, the system achieved a background rate of 0.49 $\\rm cpm/cm^2$ while retaining more than 55% of $^{90}$Sr beta signals within a 7 cm diameter detection region. Further analysis revealed that approximately 70% of the background originates from environmental gamma radiation, while the remaining contribution mainly comes from intrinsic radioactivity of detector materials, particularly the FR-4 based field cage and readout plane. Based on the knowledge gained from the experiments and simulations, an optimization of the TPC system has been proposed, with simulation predicting a potential reduction of the background rate to 0.0012 $\\rm cpm/cm^2$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These ingredients define an \"information volume\" for each observational cell.\n  By incorporating the logarithm of this volume as an additional constraint in a minimum-relative-entropy inference scheme, temperature, chemical potential, and pressure arise as conjugate variables of a single information-theoretic functional. This leads to a Legendre-type structure and a first-law-like relation in which pressure corresponds to information volume rather than geometric volume.\n  For nonequilibrium dynamics, entropy production is characterized through the relative-entropy asymmetry between forward and time-reversed stochastic evolutions. A decomposition using observational entropy then separates total dissipation into system and environment contributions. Heat is defined as the part of dissipation not accounted for by the system-entropy change, yielding a representation that does not rely on local detailed balance or a specific bath model. We further show that the difference between joint and partially observed dissipation equals the average of conditional relative entropies, providing a unified interpretation of hidden dissipation and information-flow terms as projection-induced gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization.

However, understanding their origin and properties remains a significant challenge due to competing and often long-range interactions mediated by conduction electrons.

Beyond magnetic frustration, we identify the competition between dipolar interactions and easy-plane single-ion anisotropy as a key ingredient for stabilizing the rich chiral magnetic phases observed in this compound -- including a hexagonal skyrmion crystal and two distinct meron crystals.

Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame.

We describe how the colour dependence of any Feynman diagram can be systematically decomposed into these bases, and how amplitudes expressed in these bases compare with other choices of tensors such as multi-traces or `f-graphs'.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u7ebf\u6027\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u989c\u8272\u5f20\u91cf\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u8272\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u8be5\u96c6\u5408\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u5730\u5f20\u91cf\u6765\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u610f\u8d39\u66fc\u56fe\u7684\u989c\u8272\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8868\u793a\u989c\u8272\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u5143\u6811\u56fe\u7684\u989c\u8272\u5f20\u91cf\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9876\u70b9\u7684Clebsch-Gordan\u7cfb\u6570\u5c06\u5916\u90e8\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8868\u793a\u8fde\u63a5\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u8d39\u66fc\u56fe\u7684\u989c\u8272\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u8272\u5f20\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u57fa\u8272\u5f20\u91cf\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u5f20\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u591a\u8ff9\u6216f-\u56fe\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u8272\u5f20\u91cf\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002"}}

They give rise to spin-liquid phases with full spin-rotation and lattice-translational symmetries but broken time-reversal symmetry. Although non-zero on elementary plaquettes, the net orbital magnetic moment is guaranteed to vanish as a result of point symmetries; due to the analogy to long-range ordered altermagnets, these types of phases were dubbed altermagnetic spin liquids in [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 023152 (2025)]. For the spin-$3/2$ model, we find that a $g$-wave altermagnetic spin liquid emerges as the unique ground state. In contrast, the spin-7/2 model exhibits a significantly richer phase diagram, involving different types of chiral spin liquids competing with a $d$-wave altermagnetic spin liquid. Finally, we identify and characterize the topological and non-topological excitations, illustrating the rich physics of altermagnetic spin liquids resulting from the interplay of non-trivial topological and symmetry aspects of this novel phase of matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u7684 Majorana \u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62-\u516b\u8fb9\u5f62\u548c\u68cb\u76d8\u683c\u6676\u683c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4f46\u7834\u574f\u65f6\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u76f8\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u672c plaquettes\u4e0a\u6709\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u78c1\u77e9\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u51c0\u8f68\u9053\u78c1\u77e9\u786e\u4fdd\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e8e\u957f\u7a0b\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u4f53\uff0c\u88ab\u79f0\u4f5c\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u65cb $3/2$ \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u662f $g$-\u6ce2\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u3002\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb $7/2$ \u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb assigned \u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5730\u4e0e $d$-\u6ce2\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u5171\u5b58\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u975e\u62d3\u6251\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e2d\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u4f53\u662f\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u548c\u76f8\u56fe\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62-\u516b\u8fb9\u5f62\u548c\u68cb\u76d8\u683c\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Majorana \u8868\u793a\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb $3/2$ \u548c\u81ea\u65cb $7/2$ \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u62ec $g$-\u6ce2\u548c $d$-\u6ce2\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e92\u4f5c\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u7684 Majorana \u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u4e0e\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

In contrast, topological superconductors with their inherent particle-hole symmetry can host a thermal metallic phase, which is non-universal and depends on the nature of microscopic disorder. In this work, we demonstrate that in the presence of geometric disorders, such as random bond dilution, a robust metal can emerge in a Chern insulator with particle-hole symmetry. The metallic phase is realized when the broken links are weakly stitched via concomitant insertion of $\u03c0$ fluxes in the plaquettes. These nucleate low-energy manifolds, which can provide percolating conduction pathways for fermions to elude localization. This diffusive metal, unlike those in superconductors, can carry charge current and even anomalous Hall current. We investigate the transport properties and show that while the topological insulator to Anderson insulator transition exhibits the expected Dirac universality, the metal insulator transition displays a different critical exponent $\u03bd\\approx 2$ compared to a disordered topological superconductor, where $\u03bd\\approx 1.4$.

However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations.

Previous camera-based biphoton imaging experiments have relied on photon-counting detection, which necessitates operation deep in the photon-sparse regime and requires extremely low dark rates.\n  Here, we demonstrate the detection of spatial biphoton joint probability distributions in both the image plane and the pupil plane (also termed \"near-field plane\" and \"far-field plane\" respectively) using a conventional scientific CMOS camera operated in linear mode. We work at mesoscopic intensity levels, corresponding to a photon flux approximately four orders of magnitude higher than typical photon-counting approaches. From the measured image- and pupil plane correlations, we observe position and momentum correlations consistent with an EPR-type entanglement witness.\n  A tailored correlation analysis suited for image plane imaging suppresses detector artifacts and intensity fluctuations, enabling acquisition with significantly fewer frames.

Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fdb\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5149\u8f74\u9644\u8fd1\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u74e6\u5c14zschild\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6270\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u5c55\u5f00\u5f84\u5411\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6563\u5c04\u7ea7\u6570\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u6591\u7684\u53d1\u6563\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6cca\u677e\u6591\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6ce2\u524d\u7578\u53d8\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u8005\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u6563\u5c04\u89d2\u533a\u57df\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u8005\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6563\u5c04\u89d2\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5728\u9891\u7387\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6563\u5c04\u4f20\u64ad\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0eKirchhoff\u884d\u5c04\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u540e\u8005\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u957f\u7a0b\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6781\u5316\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6563\u5c04\u5f3a\u573a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u800c\u7269\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e72\u6d89\u6210\u50cf\u6807\u51c6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6563\u5c04\u5728\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u662f\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5149\u8f74\u9644\u8fd1\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u3002", "method": "\u65bd\u74e6\u5c14zschild\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6270\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u5c55\u5f00\u5f84\u5411\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u6e10\u8fdb\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u6563\u5c04\u89d2\u533a\u57df\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u89e3\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0eKirchhoff\u884d\u5c04\u79ef\u5206\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u573a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e72\u6d89\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In contrast, for spatially separated dual spin currents, the time-reversal-invariant vector chirality emerges as a critical factor governing magnetization dynamics. Here, we investigate field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in an altermagnet RuO2/ferromagnet/heavy metal Pt trilayer, driven by chiral dual spin currents (CDSC). We demonstrate that the chirality of these dual spin currents acts as the deterministic role in breaking out-of-plane symmetry. Leveraging the intrinsic spin-splitting effect of the d-wave altermagnet to generate an x-polarized spin component, the interplay of non-collinear spin currents from two adjacent layers induces a helical magnetic texture within the intermediate layer. The resulting intralayer exchange coupling manifests as an effective in-plane magnetic field, facilitating deterministic switching.

The classical phase space M = T*Q is taken as the base of a trivial Hilbert bundle E ~ M x H, and the familiar position and momentum representations are realised as different global trivialisations of this bundle. The Fourier transform appears as a fibrewise unitary transition function, so that the standard position-momentum duality is made precise as a change of coordinates on a single geometric object. For the circle, we also discuss twisted boundary conditions and show how a twist parameter can be incorporated either as a fixed boundary condition or as a base coordinate, in which case it gives rise to a flat U(H)-connection with nontrivial holonomy.

Using a waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer internally loaded with two sets of non-concentric dual ring resonators, we demonstrate the generation of unclonable keys for one-time pad encryption which can be reconfigured on the fly by applying small voltages to on-chip thermo-optic elements. With this method, we access a keyspace larger than 12 Tb for a single device with simple, single-mode waveguide input and output coupling. Using two devices at either end of a communication channel, we show that an eavesdropper tapping the channel fibre link would be unable to recover the same spectrum measured at either end of the link, providing physical encryption for key distribution.

For the generic case, we check equivalence with instanton partition function of a 5d circular quiver gauge theory. For the degenerate case, we check equivalence with partition function of a defect in the same theory, also known as the Shiraishi function. We find agreement in both cases.

The second R\u00e9nyi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. However, Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and second R\u00e9nyi entropies varies from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the R\u00e9nyi index. By constructing a number-conserving many-body state with only two local degrees of freedom, we obtain a R\u00e9nyi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling: the second R\u00e9nyi entropy remains logarithmic while the von Neumann entropy is parametrically larger. We then introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved second R\u00e9nyi entropies and the subsystem charge distribution.

As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material.

These findings may help us understand better the possibilities of nonlinear simulations on a quantum computer, and also pave the way for a discussion on how quantum machine learning might be harnessed to address more complex problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u8fd1\u4f3c\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u78b0\u649e\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u6765\u7ed5\u8fc7\u9700\u8981\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u6d41\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u8def\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u8154\u6d41\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u901f\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u538b\u529b\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u78b0\u649e\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u8def\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7701\u53bb\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u8154\u6d41\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e3b\u8981\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u901f\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9650\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Here we demonstrate device-relevant ultrabroadband near-infrared (NIR) photonics by integrating element-specific roles within an entropy-stabilized lattice. We establish high-entropy rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb,Re)Cl6 (Re3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), where near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase cubic solid solution (S_config about 1.6R) with homogeneous multication incorporation. Sb3+ acts as a broadband sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide emitters, transforming single-mode emission into wide-coverage NIR output (850-1600 nm) with three fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced signature enables redundancy-based ratiometric readout with reduced sensitivity to intensity drift, supporting reliable solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing. Beyond functional expansion, accelerated aging tests show markedly improved tolerance to humidity and oxygen versus single-component analogues. The robustness is experimentally attributed to octahedral contraction-strengthened metal-halide bonding that increases the kinetic barrier for moisture-triggered bond cleavage, together with entropy-induced lattice distortion that impedes long-range halide migration and suppresses defect/impurity-phase formation. Finally, a UV-pumped phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, wide-coverage NIR illumination, highlighting configurational-entropy engineering as a practical strategy to couple ultrabroadband photonic function with environmental stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability.

Specifically, this method combines two known field theories into a new composite field theory whose target space is the product of the original target spaces. By suitably coupling the fields through a superpotential defined on the product space, the dynamics in the subspaces become entangled while preserving original kinks as boundary kinks.

Broken symmetries in such a system can lead to inequivalent lattice sites, and magnetic impurities may interact selectively with particular orbitals or sublattices. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind such site-specific interactions have been poorly understood. Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster. While the results underscore a crucial role of the direct orbital hybridization and the limitation of the prevailing single-site Kondo impurity model, they suggest the possibility of controlling entangled interactions separately in a cluster Mott insulator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5355\u4e2aFe\u539f\u5b50\u57281T-TaS2\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u63a5\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Fe\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684Mott\u6001\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u81ea\u65cb\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7535\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6742\u8d28\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528STM/STS\u548cDFT\u7814\u7a76Fe\u539f\u5b50\u5728\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "Fe\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\u5fc3Mott\u6001\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0cFe\u4e0eTa\u7684\u6742\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6539\u53d8\u81ea\u65cb\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u4e2aFe\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6742\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

By integrating multimodal microscopy with a deep-learning-enhanced dimensional upscaling framework, we translate 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) contrast into quantitative three-dimensional (3D) morphologies with accurate facet identification. Coupling these observations with machine-learning-assisted density functional theory, we demonstrate that reconstruction is governed by a unified thermodynamic mechanism where high-index facets correspond to specific local minima in the surface energy landscape.

In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry.\n  Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.\n  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.\n  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $\u03bb$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance.

We show that the orbital magnetic octupole is naturally linked to a higher-rank Hall response induced by spatially nonuniform electric fields, leading to a generalized St\u0159eda-type relation.

The well-known PXP model, a U$(1)$ LGT with a two-level electric field in one spatial dimension, has become a paradigm of exotic physics in and out of equilibrium. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \\emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars.

In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \\neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the ratio of spin to charge conductance exhibits characteristic square-like patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization.

We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\u03c0$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "floquet\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406floquet\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u80fd\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7(k,t)\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u4ecefloquet-bloch\u7279\u5f81\u6001\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u63ed\u793afloquet\u7279\u5f81\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "non-equilibrium\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406floquet\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u3002\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e(k,t)\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u4ecefloquet-bloch\u7279\u5f81\u6001\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec0-\u80fd\u9699\u548c\u03c0-\u80fd\u9699\u57281d aiii, 1d d, \u548c2d a\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7(k,t)\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u4e86floquet\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Here, we investigate the magnetic ground state and quasiparticle excitations of the fascinating double perovskite system, Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$, through Time of flight (TOF) neutron diffraction (TOF), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical modelling. The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the other rare-earth (R) members in this family, A$_2$RRuO$_6$ (A = Ca/Sr/Ba), which typically show magnetic ordering of the Ru ions, followed by R-ion ordering. Our neutron diffraction results confirm that long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx 47$~K, primarily driven by 4d--4f Ru$^{5+}$--Dy$^{3+}$ exchange interactions, where both Dy and Ru moments start to order simultaneously. The ordered ground state is a collinear antiferromagnet with Ising character, carrying ordered moments of $\u03bc_{\\mathrm{Ru}} = 1.6(1)~\u03bc_\\mathrm{B}$ and $\u03bc_{\\mathrm{Dy}} = 5.1(1)~\u03bc_\\mathrm{B}$ at 1.5~K. Low-temperature INS reveals well-defined magnon excitations below 10~meV. SpinW modelling of the INS spectra evidences complex exchange interactions and the presence of magnetic anisotropy, which governs the Ising ground state and accounts for the observed magnon spectrum. Combined INS and Raman spectroscopy reveal crystal-electric-field (CEF) excitations of Dy$^{3+}$ at 46.5 and 71.8~meV in the paramagnetic region. The observed CEF levels are reproduced by point-charge calculations consistent with the $O_h$ symmetry of Dy$^{3+}$. A complementary machine-learning approach is used to analyse the phonon spectrum and compare with INS data. Together, these results clarify the origin of phonon and magnon excitations and their role in the ground-state magnetism of Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It relies on electronic states with spin valley locking, first predicted and observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2. However, very few bulk materials have been reported to host spin valley locked electronic states. In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two. This difference arises from significant variations in their orthorhombic crystal structures and spin orbit coupling.

The guided wave resembles the edge states in electronic systems: it is induced by the topological Hall effect, and the wave propagates along the interface but not in the bulk media. Starting from a symmetric honeycomb photonic crystal that attains Dirac points at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, $K$ and $K'$, we introduce two classes of perturbations for the periodic medium.

Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature.

In the isothermal ensemble, additional temperature information is present. The phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which is observed in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information arise from fundamental differences in isobaric and isothermal evolution. Image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius in isobaric evolution but exhibits nonmonotonic behavior in isothermal evolution. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between isobaric and isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius, whose relative ordering with small and large black hole radii at phase transition supports only two of the three logical possibilities. Image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitative differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information.", "conclusion": "This research broadens the observational methods for studying black hole thermodynamic properties and introduces a new framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems by examining phase transitions and nonmonotonic evolution together."}}

Molecular dynamics (MD) naturally captures ballistic transport and phonon nonequilibrium, but has not been applied to hot-spot problems due to computational cost. Here, we perform the first MD simulations of hot-spot heat transfer across ballistic-diffusive regimes and benchmark them against FEM. We find that FEM using bulk thermal conductivity $\u03ba_0$ significantly underestimates hot-spot temperature, even when the channel thickness is ~10 times the phonon mean free path, indicating persistent non-Fourier effects. We introduce a size-dependent \"best\" conductivity, $\u03ba_{\\mathrm{best}}$, using which FEM can reproduce MD hot-spot temperatures with high fidelity. We further decompose the MD-extracted thermal resistance into: (i) diffusive spreading, (ii) cross-plane ballistic, (iii) heat-carrier selective heating, and (iv) residual 3D ballistic-spreading resistances, and quantify each contribution.

Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\\;M_\\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.\n  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\\mathcal{C}_{\\max}\\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $\u03bb_{\\rm BL}\\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u538b\u529b\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86BL\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528BL\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u534a\u5c40\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e86SLy\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u538b\u529b\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u81f32.4 M_odot\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u7d27\u51d1\u602720%\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u538b\u529b\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u538b\u529b\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level.

Here we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR within an open-quantum-system framework by solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a hybrid system of free electrons and local moments using the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the N\u00e9el vector in antiferromagnets.

This approach yields transmittance oscillations with a period of ~20 fs, which corresponds to three optical cycles of the probe beam. To achieve a similar oscillatory modulation in the refractive index, we incorporate a TCO electron-acceptor layer on top of the inverse-designed cavity, enabling thermionic carrier injection at the TCO heterojunction.

The findings not only clarify the elusive transient physics in TCOs but also demonstrate, for the first time, the critical role of electron temperatures in driving oscillatory dynamic responses.

Within a semiclassical framework, we compute the energy emission of Hawking radiation by introducing a massless scalar field as a test field, considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled cases. For the minimally coupled case, we find that loop quantum gravity effects become crucial at the late stage of the evaporation process, causing the emission rate to slow down and eventually terminate, leading to the formation of a black hole remnant. A quasi-normal mode analysis indicates the stability of this remnant. For the non-minimally coupled case, we show that the fate of the black hole strongly depends on the value of the coupling constant $\u03be$. Focusing on the cases $\u03be=\\pm1$, we find that for $\u03be=1$, the energy emission rate accelerates at late times and no remnant is formed, whereas for $\u03be=-1$, the emission rate slows down and eventually terminates, resulting in a stable black hole remnant, as supported by the corresponding quasi-normal mode analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50Oppenheimer-Snyder\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u84b8\u53d1\uff0c semiclassical\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u548c\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u84b8\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u540e\u671f\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u51cf\u6162\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f59\u7559\uff0c\u4e14\u4f59\u7559\u5904\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6027\u8d28\u53d7\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u03be\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f53\u03be=1\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u5c04\u901f\u7387\u5728\u540e\u671f\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u4f59\u7559\uff1b\u5f53\u03be=-1\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u5c04\u901f\u7387\u540e\u671f\u51cf\u7f13\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ec8\u6b62\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f59\u7559\uff0c\u7ecf\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u84b8\u53d1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6027\u8d28\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": " semiclassical\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u548c\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86 Hawking \u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d1\u5c04\u901f\u7387\u51cf\u6162\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u505c\u6b62\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f59\u7559\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u03be=-1\u65f6\uff0c\u4f59\u7559\u5f62\u6210\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f53\u03be=1\u65f6\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4f59\u7559\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728 semiclassical\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50Oppenheimer-Snyd \u9ed1\u6d1e\u84b8\u53d1\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f62\u6210\u4f59\u7559\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f59\u7559\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u03be\u503c\u3002"}}

We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, \u03bd_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{\u03c9_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, \u03bd_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation. As an application, we classify the 230 space-group topological crystalline superconductors in interacting electronic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These geometric properties influence electronic transport and result in the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects, and are typically controlled using static electric fields or strain. However, the possibility of modulating quantum geometric quantities in real-time remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic modulation of Berry curvature and its moments, as well as the generation of a pseudo-electric field using time-dependent strain. By placing heterostructures on a membrane, we introduce oscillatory strain together with an in-plane AC electric field and measure Hall signals that are modulated at linear combinations of the frequencies of strain and electric field. Our measurements reveal modulation of Berry curvature and its first moment. Notably, we provide direct experimental evidence of pseudo-electric field that results in an unusual dynamic strain-induced Hall response. This approach opens up a new pathway for controlling quantum geometry on demand, moving beyond conventional static perturbations. The pseudo-electric field provides a framework for external electric field-free anomalous Hall response and opens new avenues for probing the topological properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001Berry\u66f2\u7387\u8c03\u63a7\u53ca\u5176\u7535\u8377\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": " Berry\u66f2\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u77e9\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u7535\u529b\u6216\u5e94\u53d8\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u63a7\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0 Berry \u66f2\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8c03\u63a7\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u632f\u8361\u5e94\u53d8\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u6cbf\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u7535\u573a\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86Hall\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86Berry\u66f2\u7387\u548c Berry\u66f2\u7387\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4f2a\u7535\u573a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u9a71\u52a8Hall\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 Berry \u66f2\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u77e9\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 Berry \u66f2\u7387\u7b49\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u5916\u7535\u573a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38Hall\u6548\u5e94\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\u63a2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Chaotic emissions from semiconductor lasers are attractive in this context because of their fast dynamics and nonrepetitive behavior. Their spectral bandwidth, however, is typically limited to several tens of gigahertz, which constrains the achievable entropy rate and makes ultrafast random bit generation difficult without substantial post-processing. Here, we demonstrate a chaos-based entropy source that employs optical heterodyning between the chaotic emission from a semiconductor laser and an optical frequency comb, yielding a bandwidth exceeding 100 GHz and an experimentally verified single-channel entropy rate of 1.86 Tb/s. By directly extracting multiple bits from the digitized output of the entropy source, we achieve a single-channel random bit generation rate of 1.536 Tb/s, while four-channel parallelization reaches 6.144 Tb/s with no observable interchannel correlation. This linear scalability suggests that aggregate throughput could reach hundreds of terabits per second with additional parallel channels.

For cases that are physically viable in the sense that both a consistent cosmological background and tensor gravitational waves exist, we count the number of degrees of freedom based on two approaches. First we investigate the linear cosmological perturbations around an FLRW background. Then we perform a Dirac-Bergmann Hamiltonian constraint analysis to count the number of DOFs at the nonperturbative level. We focus on three representative cases. In case II, both the perturbative and nonperturbative approaches yield the same result, which indicates that the theory propagates 10 degrees of freedom.

In this work, we investigate how these features are modified by a TsT deformation of the background, which renders the Kalb Ramond field physical and radially dependent, thereby obscuring its interpretation as a constant magnetic field.\n  We show that chiral symmetry breaking persists in the deformed model. The meson spectrum, however, depends on the fluctuation sector. Fluctuations perpendicular to the magnetic field are sensitive to the deformation and, for generic values of the TsT parameter $\\mathrm{k}$, do not admit a consistent spectrum due to divergent behavior near the horizon, whereas fluctuations parallel to the magnetic field remain unaffected.\n  Remarkably, the combined effect of the magnetic field and the TsT deformation singles out the special value $\\mathrm{k} = -\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{H}}$. At this point, the perpendicular modes are restored. Moreover, the Kalb Ramond field becomes constant again, recovering its interpretation as a magnetic field. The resulting effects on the spectrum appear only at order $O(H^2)$, and therefore the Zeeman splitting, if present at all, is shifted to this higher order.\n  Furthermore, the resulting background with $\\mathrm{k} = - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{H}}$ is interesting in its own right, even without embedding any brane. The spacetime admits an interpretation in terms of D1 branes and exhibits a degenerate boundary geometry, asymptotically $\\mathrm{AdS}_3 \\times S^5$, with a degenerate horizon.

They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $\u03b1$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $\u03b1$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The device is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose complex eigenvalues encode the energy (real part) and the broadening (imaginary part) of the Andreev quasi-bound states. When extending the Andreev current formula to the non-Hermitian case, a novel contribution arises that is proportional to the phase derivative of the levels broadening. This term becomes particularly relevant in the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectrum, but its experimental detection is not straightforward. We identify optimal Andreev spectrum configurations where this novel current contribution can be clearly highlighted, and we outline an experimental protocol for its detection. We point out that the phase dependence in the levels imaginary part originates from the breaking of a time-reversal-like symmetry. In particular, spectral configurations in the broken phase of the symmetry and without EPs can be obtained, where this novel contribution can be easily resolved.

A holomorphic conformal field theory with a Kac-Moody subalgebra implies a topological interface between Chern-Simons gauge theories. Upon condensing a suitable set of anyons, such an interface yields a duality between topological field theories. We illustrate this idea using the $c=24$ holomorphic theories classified by Schellekens, which leads to a list of novel sporadic dualities. Some of these dualities necessarily involve condensation of anyons with non-abelian statistics, i.e. gauging non-invertible one-form global symmetries. Several of the examples we discover generalize from $c=24$ to an infinite series. This includes the fact that Spin$(n^{2})_{2}$ is dual to a twisted dihedral group gauge theory. Finally, if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $k$, we deduce the existence of a sequence of holomorphic CFTs at central charge $c=2(k-1)$ with fusion category symmetry given by $\\mathrm{Spin}(k)_{2}$ or equivalently, the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-equivariantization of a Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u590d\u5f62\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\uff08CFT\uff09\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\uff08TQFT\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6c34\u5e73-\u79e9\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u4e8c\u7ef4\u590d\u5f62\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790Schellekens\u5206\u7c7b\u7684c=24\u7684\u590d\u5f62\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4TQFT\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4efb\u4f55\u5b50\u51dd\u805a\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u5947\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cc=24\u7684\u590d\u5f62\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u5230\u65e0\u9650\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eSpin(n^2)_2\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u4e8c\u9762\u4f53\u7fa4\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u5076\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u7406\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u7684\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6570\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism.

Existing studies mostly address these factors separately, while in practice their correlated effects set a fundamental limit on storage performance. We develop a comprehensive model that simultaneously incorporates disordered coupling and detuning. It is shown that these disorders induce a random Berry's phase in the stored states, while decoherence from disordered coupling stems from correlations with detuning rather than individual imperfections.

Using a physics-informed digital twin, we optimize granular phase masks to deterministically concentrate energy into targeted detector regions, enabling end-to-end co-design of the optical transformation and a lightweight electronic readout. We experimentally validate the approach on BreastMNIST and Olivetti Faces, achieving accuracies of 82.45\\% and 95.00\\%, respectively, competitive with standard digital baselines.

As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\u03bc$\\si{\\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \\pm 38)$~\\si{\\nano\\meter} in the device.

To quantify robustness against noise, we introduce a practical notion of quasi-ergodicity: ensembles prepared in a small angular patch at fixed purity rapidly spread to cover all directions, while the purity gradually decreases toward its minimal value. By varying the final single-qubit gate, we identify a broad family of protocols that remain ergodic-like for pure states, supported by consistent diagnostics including the absence of attracting cycles, agreement of time and ensemble statistics, rapid spreading from localized regions, and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. Away from the special globally mixing case, the mixed-state dynamics can change qualitatively: for most ergodic-like parameters, a finite subset of noisy inputs is driven toward purification rather than complete mixing, demonstrating the coexistence of statistical mixing and purification within a single iterated protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f15\u8d77\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7eaf\u5355\u4e00\u6bd4\u7279\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5355\u4e00\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u5c40\u6df7\u4e71\u3001\u5f3a\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6574\u4e2a\u5e03\u7f57\u7403\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6620\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u904d\u5386\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u51c6\u5907\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6df7\u5408\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5e03\u7f57\u7403\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u662f\u6df7\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bb8\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u77ed\u6682\u589e\u52a0\u540e\u6700\u7ec8\u6536\u655b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u51c6\u904d\u5386\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff1a\u5c0f\u89d2\u5ea6\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u5c0f\u5e45\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7eaf\u5ea6\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u7c7b\u4fdd\u5e8f\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u7eaf\u6001\u5177\u6709\u4fdd\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u5305\u62ec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5438\u5f15\u5468\u671f\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u96c6\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u6269\u6563\u3001\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u5728\u7279\u6b8a\u5168\u5c40\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4fdd\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u88ab\u9a71\u52a8\u5411\u7eaf\u5316\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u7eaf\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u5171\u5b58\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f15\u8d77\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u662f\u6df7\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bb8\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u77ed\u6682\u589e\u52a0\u540e\u6700\u7ec8\u6536\u655b", "conclusion": "Consistent diagnostics including the absence of attracting cycles, agreement of time and ensemble statistics, rapid spreading from localized regions, and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions."}}

Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth, shallow, and engraving-like topographies produced from a flat film. Here we introduce an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform that exploits engineered darkness within computer-generated holograms to spatially localize inward mass transport and directly produce positive, protruding microreliefs. We show that isolated and array of micro-bumps can be generated from pristine flat azopolymer films in a single writing step, and we introduce spatiotemporal control through sequential tailored illumination to reshape microrelief profiles, enabling flattened-top micropillars, programmable array shapes and arrangements, and free-form continuous microrelief designs. Hierarchical microarchitectures are also demonstrated by extending the concept of multi-step illumination sequences. As functional demonstrations, we realize multi-focus microlenses and quasi-square diffraction gratings with enhanced 1st-order efficiencies. Finally, we leverage azopolymer reconfigurability to implement write-erase-rewrite cycles that reset and repurpose the same surface region for distinct micropatterns, enabling rewritable surfaces and reprogrammable master templates for replication. Overall, this work establishes a scalable spatiotemporal strategy for on-demand, all-optical microfabrication and reprogramming of structured surfaces, where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of holographic patterns intermix to produce advanced patterning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new all-optical, maskless method for creating complex microstructures in azopolymers using computer-generated holograms provides significant advances in microfabrication.", "motivation": "The need for simpler and more efficient fabrication methods for microstructured surfaces in photonics, biointerfaces, and functional coatings.", "method": "Developed an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform using engineered darkness in computer-generated holograms to spatially localize mass transport for creating protruding microreliefs.", "result": "The method enables the generation of isolated and arrays of micro-bumps, spatiotemporal control for shaping microrelief profiles, and applications such as multi-focus microlenses, quasi-square diffraction gratings, and rewritable surfaces.", "conclusion": "This approach offers a scalable, flexible, and high-efficiency solution for on-demand microfabrication of structured surfaces with potential for reprogramming and replication."}}

The near-horizon geometry contains an AdS2 throat with a constant electric field, which lowers the effective mass of the scalar and can trigger a violation of the AdS2 Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We show that this instability is resolved by the formation of a static scalar cloud supported by Schwinger pair production. The condensate backreacts on the gauge field and partially screens the electric flux, leading to a self-consistent stationary configuration. The scalar profile is obtained analytically from the near-horizon equations and exhibits the characteristic behavior of a BF-violating mode in AdS2. We analyze the associated boundary conditions, the induced charge density, and the resulting modification of the electric field.

For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \\equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence.

In contrast, three-dimensional lattices are found to be fundamentally non-radiative due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission, with decay only at discrete Bragg resonances.

By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions.

The resulting thermodynamic pressure increases with temperature but exhibits an approximately logarithmic dependence. This is expected, as this is the de-confined phase of QGP; it is not exactly an ideal gas due to self-interaction. We also perform lattice calculations for the system to contrast continuum and lattice perspectives. We then add the GW to the thermodynamic QGP model and show that certain frequencies of the GW can induce instabilities in the QGP. Our analysis explores the limitations and role of non-perturbative, time-dependent backgrounds in semi-classical description of Yang-Mills dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u72b6\u6001QGP\uff0c\u5229\u7528SU(2)\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u5171\u8f6d\u573a\u7b49\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ecf\u5178\u80cc\u666f\u573a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5176\u6d41\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u573a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0d\u65ad\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u538b\u529b\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86QGP\u7684\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Lattice\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecb\u8d28QGP\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027 broke \u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff1a\u8fd0\u7528\u80cc\u666f\u573a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u70ed\u6838\u5c55\u5f00\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u538b\u529b\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff1a\u91c7\u7528Lattice\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u538b\u529b\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u5448\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660eQGP\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u4f1a\u6709\u81ea\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u9891\u7387\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4QGP\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e ethers \u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7684SU(2)\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u5171\u8f6d\u573a\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0QGP\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5176\u6d41\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u4e92\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e0d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6709\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

By incorporating both radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations into the Dirac equation within an open quantum system framework, our approach captures the Zitterbewegung of the electron, ensuing noncommutativity of its effective spatial coordinates, and provides the quantum analogue of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) classical equation of motion with radiation reaction. We develop the corresponding phase-space representation via the relativistic Wigner function and derive the semiclassical limit through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter elucidates the signature of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the LL equation, and shows its relationship with the corrected Sokolov equation.

The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $\u03b1$, $\u03b2$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring.

The Uhlmann geometric phase offers a natural extension of pure-state paradigms and can exhibit a topological character. However, observation of this invariant is impeded by the incompatibility between Uhlmann parallel transport and Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as the difficulty of preparing topologically nontrivial mixed states. To address this challenge, we report an experimentally accessible protocol for directly measuring the mixed-state topological invariant. By engineering controlled nonunitary dynamics in a photonic quantum walk, we prepare topologically nontrivial mixed states from a trivial initial state.

We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3Birkhoff\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3Birkhoff\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6784\u9020\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff08\u5c18\u57c3\u548c\u5f15\u529b\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684LTB\u58f3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5171\u5f62\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u58f3\u5c42\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u9759\u6001\u771f\u7a7a\u5ea6\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6784\u9020\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u76844D\u5171\u53d8\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\u5fae\u5206\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u805a\u5408\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u9759\u6001\u573a\u4e4b\u5916\u8003\u8651\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The expectation has been extensively verified in the maximally broken phase $G\\to U(1)^r$. Here we address the non-Abelian regime in which $H$ contains a semisimple factor $H^{s}$.

Stojanovic", "Tommaso Calarco", "Andrea Muratori"], "title": "Harnessing subspace controllability: Time-optimal Dicke-state generation in Heisenberg-coupled qubit arrays with a single local control", "comment": "16 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "We explore the feasibility of realizing Dicke states in qubit arrays with always-on isotropic Heisenberg coupling between adjacent qubits, assuming a single Zeeman-type control acting in the $z$ direction on an actuator qubit. The Lie-algebraic criteria of controllability imply that such an array is not completely controllable, but satisfies the conditions for subspace controllability on any subspace with a fixed number of excitations. Therefore, a qubit array described by the model under consideration is state-to-state controllable for an arbitrary choice of initial and final states that have the same Hamming weight. This limited controllability is exploited here for the time-optimal dynamical generation of an $a$-excitation Dicke state $|D^{N}_{a}\\rangle$ ($a=1,2,\\ldots, N-1$) in a linear array with $N$ qubits starting from a generic Hamming-weight-$a$ product state. To dynamically generate the desired Dicke states -- including $W$ states $|W_{N}\\rangle$ as their special ($a=1$) case -- in the shortest possible time with a single local $Z$ control, we employ an optimal-control scheme based on the dressed Chopped RAndom Basis (dCRAB) algorithm. We optimize the target-state fidelity over the expansion coefficients of smoothly-varying control fields in a truncated random Fourier basis; this is done by combining Nelder-Mead-type local optimizations with the multistart-based clustering algorithm that facilitates searches for global extrema.

In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\\,M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints.

Two observers are introduced, one in an open chart of de Sitter space and the other in a global chart. The observers calculate the quantum discord generated by each detecting a mode. The relationship between an observer in one of the two Rindler charts in flat space and another in a Minkowski chart is comparable to this circumstance.

We establish that the large central charge of the boundary conformal field theory corresponds to classical gravity, while a small central charge corresponds to quantum gravity described by Loop Quantum Gravity. In addition, we study the thermodynamic behavior of AdS-Schwarzschild black holes for both large and small central charges. For large central charge, the classical AdS-Schwarzschild black holes have two phases: unstable small black holes and stable large black holes. Conversely, for small central charge, black holes are stable, and their entropy is smaller than that of classical black holes. To explore the influence of the boundary central charge on the information loss paradox, we use the island formula to recover the Page curve. We find that before the Page time, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases with time, and its slope is determined by the central charge of the boundary theory. After the Page time, the island inside black holes emerges, and the unitarity of black hole evaporation is restored, yielding a constant entropy consistent with the Page curve.

Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials.

By constructing appropriate metrics in each dynamical regime, namely the unbroken-symmetry phase, the broken-symmetry phase, and at exceptional points, we provide a consistent definition of expectation values, variances, and time evolution within a Krein-space framework. Within this approach, we derive a generalized Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty inequality which is valid across all spectral regimes. As an application, we analyze a two level model with parity-time reversal symmetry and show that, while the uncertainty measure exhibits oscillatory behavior in the unbroken phase, it evolves toward a minimum-uncertainty steady state in the broken symmetry phase and at exceptional points. We further compare our metric-based description with a Lindblad master-equation approach and show their agreement in the steady state. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating appropriate metric structures to extract physically meaningful predictions from non-Hermitian quantum dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9636\u6bb5\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5373\u672a\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u548cExceptional\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u503c\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Krein\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u80fd\u8c31\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49Heisenberg-Robertson\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u5177\u6709Parity-Time\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u672a\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u632f\u8361\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u548cExceptional\u70b9\uff0c\u5b83\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u548cLindbladmaster\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6001\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u4ece\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u5f53\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u548cExceptional\u70b9\u6784\u5efaKrein\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u671f\u671b\u503c\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e7f\u4e49Heisenberg-Robertson\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u819c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cLindblad master\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6001\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672a\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548cExceptional\u70b9\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6001\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fc5\u987b\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u5f53\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4ece\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Accurate modeling of these devices is essential for predicting performance, improving design, and optimizing control. Many modeling approaches currently rely on lumped circuit approximations or other simplified treatments that can be limited in resolving the interplay between the qubit dynamics and the electromagnetic circuitry, leading to significant experimental deviations from numerical predictions at times. To address many of these limitations, methods that self-consistently solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for qubit dynamics with the classical Maxwell's equations have been developed and shown to accurately predict a wide range of effects related to superconducting qubit control and readout. Despite these successes, these methods have not been able to consider multi-qubit effects that give rise to qubit-qubit entanglement. Here, we address this by rigorously deriving how multi-qubit coupling effects between transmon qubits can be embedded into Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger methods. To support this, we build on earlier first-principles derivations of Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger methods for the specific case of two transmon qubits coupled together through a common electromagnetic system in the dispersive regime. To aid in validating aspects of the Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger framework, we also provide a new interpretation of Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger methods as an efficient simulation strategy to capture the class of non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics. Our results demonstrate that these effects can give rise to strong classical crosstalk that can significantly alter multi-qubit dynamics, which we demonstrate for the cross-resonance gate. These classical crosstalk effects have been noted in cross-resonance experiments, but previous quantum theory and device analysis could not explain their origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8d85\u7ea7conducting qubits\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408Schr\u00f6dinger\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cMaxwell\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u53c9\u4f5c\u7528\u95e8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5e73\u53f0\u8d85\u7ea7conducting qubits\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u5236\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684Schr\u00f6dinger\u548cMaxwell\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6355\u83b7\u5bf9\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u4f5c\u7528\u95e8\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8d85\u7ea7conducting qubits\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $\u03c6$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $\u03c6$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u6a21\u5f0f\u5149\u5b66\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e93\u4ed1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u68b0\u632fators\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e93\u4ed1\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u03c6-\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5e93\u4ed1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u4e4e\u5176\u5fae\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7684\u9501\u5b9a\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5219\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e24\u632f\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u632fators\u95f4\u63a5\u8026\u5408\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u8154\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u6d4b\u611f\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u6d4b\u611f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u6a21\u5f0f\u5149\u5b66\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u5b50\u95f4\u5e93\u4ed1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5e93\u4ed1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5b83\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u6d4b\u611f\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002"}}

This paper develops this perspective for circuit QED dispersive readout through a first-principles derivation starting from the circuit Lagrangian. The transmon qubit terminating a transmission line resonator provides a frequency-dependent boundary condition whose pole structure encodes the qubit's transition frequencies; different qubit states yield different resonator frequencies. Two approximations, linear response and a pole-dominated expansion valid near resonance, reduce the boundary function to a rational form in the Sturm-Liouville eigenparameter. The extended Hilbert space of the Fulton-Walter spectral theory then provides a framework for the dressed-mode eigenvalue problem conditional on the qubit state. The dispersive shift and vacuum Rabi splitting emerge from the transcendental eigenvalue equation, with the residues determined by matching to the splitting: $\u03b4_{ge} = 2Lg^2\u03c9_q^2/v^4$, where $g$ is the vacuum Rabi coupling. A level repulsion theorem guarantees that no dressed mode frequency coincides with a transmon transition. For two qubits with matched dispersive shifts, odd-parity states become frequency-degenerate; true parity-only measurement requires engineered suppression of linear dispersive terms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8def\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08QED\uff09\u4e2d\u88ab\u9650\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u7535\u8def\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7528\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u5668\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u57fa\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u88ab\u9650\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u6001\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5668\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u57fa\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8defQED\u4e2d\u7684\u88ab\u9650\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u7535\u8def\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7528\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u57fa\u6001\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7535\u8def\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u6781\u70b9\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u51fd\u6570\u7ea6\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u968f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Functional Analysis\u4e2d\u7684Fulton-Walter\u8c31\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u88ab\u9650\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5957\u5a03\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5957\u5a03\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u8272\u6563\u79fb\u4f4d\u548c\u7a7a\u8154\u9e3d\u5b50Splitting\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u80fd\u7ea7\u4ea4\u9519\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8272\u6563\u79fb\u4f4d\u548c\u7a7a\u8154\u9e3d\u5b50Splitting\u7531\u8d85\u8d8a\u65b9\u7a0b\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u8272\u6563\u79fb\u4f4d\u4e0e\u6f0f\u6d1eRabi\u5206\u88c2\u5173\u7cfb\u5f0f\u4e3a\uff1a$\u03b4_{ge} = 2Lg^2\u03c9_q^2/v^4$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d$g$\u4e3a\u7a7a\u8154\u9e3d\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u80fd\u7ea7\u4ea4\u9519\u5b9a\u7406\u786e\u4fdd\u6ca1\u6709\u5957\u5a03\u6001\u4e0e\u88ab\u9650\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u88ab\u9650\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u7535\u8defQED\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u57fa\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u7535\u8def\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51fa\u53d1\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5957\u5a03\u6001\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8272\u6563\u79fb\u4f4d\u548c\u7a7a\u8154\u9e3d\u5b50Splitting\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u5f0f\u3002\u80fd\u7ea7\u4ea4\u9519\u5b9a\u7406\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u5668\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u57fa\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u5668\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

The model features direction-dependent quadratic couplings that interpolate between uniaxial and biaxial regimes and can be interpreted as an asymmetric quantum rotor. Using semiclassical dynamics, Majorana representations, and Husimi-Q distributions, we analyze the structure and metrological properties of the resulting states. The three-axis framework reproduces the known N^(-2/3) scaling of one-axis twisting and the Heisenberg-limited N^(-1) scaling of two-axis twisting, while allowing additional tunability and enhanced entanglement generation in low-spin systems. We further show that tuning the anisotropy parameters induces ground-state and excited-state quantum phase transitions, including a second-order transition associated with level clustering and critical dynamics. These results unify spin squeezing, quantum criticality, and rotor analogies, and suggest implementations in Rydberg arrays and cavity-QED platforms for precision sensing and quantum simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u8f74\u81ea\u65cb\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 metrology\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u8f74\u81ea\u65cb\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u9650\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u8f74\u81ea\u65cb\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528 semiclassical dynamics, Majorana representations, \u548c Husimi-Q distributions \u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u548c metrology \u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e09\u8f74\u81ea\u65cb\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684 metrology \u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u4f4e\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Based on the principles of generalized unitarity, they are given by products of elementary three-point amplitudes where the kinematics of internal on-shell legs are determined by cut conditions. In the ${\\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, the dual formulation for on-shell diagrams produces the same quantities as canonical forms on the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. Most of the work in this direction has been devoted to the planar diagrams, which dominate in the large $N$ limit of gauge theories. On the mathematical side, planar on-shell diagrams correspond to cells of the positive Grassmannian $G_+(k,n)$ which have been very extensively studied in the literature in the past 20 years. In this paper, we focus on the non-planar on-shell diagrams which are relevant at finite $N$. In particular, we use the triplet formulation of Maximal-Helicity-Violating (MHV) on-shell diagrams to obtain certain regions in the Grassmannian $G(2,n)$. These regions are unions of positive Grassmannians with different orderings (referred to as oriented regions).

Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\\times_{\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}}\\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\\rm F}$ or Spin$\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \\to K \\to G_{\\rm Tot} \\to G \\to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\u03bd_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\\bf B \\pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms.

An exponentially scaling DLA dimension is associated with the presence of so-called barren plateaus (BP) in the optimization landscape, which renders training intractable. In this work, we investigate the DLA of QAOA applied to the canonical MaxCut, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we show that when the weights are drawn from a continuous distribution, the DLA dimension grows as $\u0398(4^n)$ almost surely for all connected graphs except paths and cycles. In the more common unweighted setting, we show that asymptotically all but an exponentially vanishing fraction of graphs have $\u0398(4^n)$ large DLA dimension. The entire simple Lie algebra decomposition of the corresponding DLAs is also identified, from which we prove that the variance of the loss function is $O(1/2^n)$, implying that QAOA on these weighted and unweighted graphs all suffers from BP. Moreover, we give explicit constructions for families of graphs whose DLAs have exponential dimension, including cases whose MaxCut is in $\\mathsf P$. Our proof of the unweighted case is based on a number of splitting lemmas and DLA-freeness conditions that allow one to convert prohibitively complicated Lie algebraic problems into amenable graph theoretic problems. These form the basis for a new algorithm that computes such DLAs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods, reducing runtimes from days to seconds on standard hardware. We apply this algorithm to MQLib, a classical MaxCut benchmark suite covering over 3,500 instances with up to 53,130 vertices, and find that, ignoring edge weights, at least 75% of the instances possess a DLA of dimension at least $2^{128}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The QAOA's Dynamical Lie Algebra (DLA) is poorly understood beyond highly symmetric instances.

A standard method for this is interleaved benchmarking, a technique which estimates the error on an interleaved target gate by comparing cumulative error rates of randomized sequences implemented with the interleaved gate and without it. In this work, we show both numerically and experimentally that the standard approach of interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB), which uses the multi-qubit Clifford group for randomization, can produce highly inaccurate and even physically impossible estimates for the error on the interleaved gate in the presence of coherent errors. Fortunately we also show that interleaved benchmarking performed with cycle benchmarking, which randomizes with single qubit Pauli gates, provides dramatically reduced systematic uncertainty relative to standard IRB, and further provides as host of additional benefits including data reusability.

This allows flexible control over the number of binary variables and adapts well to hardware constraints. We prove convergence properties, introduce a step size adaptation scheme, and validate the method on linear regression.

Here, we develop a quantum theory modeling the dynamics of free electrons interacting with quantum emitters in arbitrary initial states.

We first introduce a physical model and analyze its Hamiltonian structure, emphasizing the role of hybrid dimensionality and axial symmetry. The effects of decoherence are then examined under two local noise mechanisms, namely dephasing and phase-flip channels, acting on the qubit and qutrit subsystems in both symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Quantum correlations are quantified using negativity to capture entanglement and quantum discord based on linear entropy to characterize more general nonclassical correlations. Our results show that both thermal fluctuations and phase noise lead to a monotonic degradation of quantum correlations, with increasing temperature accelerating coherence loss and inducing entanglement sudden death at finite temperatures. While negativity vanishes abruptly under sufficiently strong noise, quantum discord persists beyond the entanglement threshold, revealing residual quantum correlations in mixed states. We further demonstrate that asymmetric noise configurations significantly enhance the robustness of both entanglement and discord by partially shielding coherence in the less affected subsystem. A comparative analysis reveals that phase-flip noise is more destructive than pure dephasing, leading to faster suppression of quantum correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The concept of a PT transition has been extended to Markovian open quantum systems, which are described by the GKSL equation. Interestingly, the PT transition in many-body Markovian open quantum systems, the so-called \\textit{Lindbladian PT (L-PT) phase transition}, is closely related to two classes of exotic nonequilibrium many-body phenomena: \\textit{continuous-time crystals} and \\textit{non-reciprocal phase transitions}. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the study of L-PT phase transitions. First, we define PT symmetry in three distinct contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems, highlighting the interconnections between these frameworks. Second, we develop mean-field theories of L-PT phase transitions for collective-spin systems and for bipartite bosonic systems with particle-number conservation. Within these classes of models, we show that L-PT symmetry can induce a breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry down to a discrete one, leading to persistent periodic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the L-PT phase transition point is typically \\textit{a critical exceptional point}, where multiple collective excitation modes with zero excitation spectrum coalesce. These findings establish an explicit connection to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions. Third, going beyond the mean-field theory, we analyze statistical and quantum properties, such as purity and quantum entanglement indicators of time-independent steady states for several specific models with the L-PT symmetry. Finally, we discuss future research directions for L-PT phase transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that the Toffoli count can be reduced to at most n. The Toffoli depth can also be reduced to O(1), at the cost of 2n Toffoli gates, even without using any ancilla or measurement. In fact, using a measurement-based uncomputation, the Toffoli depth can be further reduced to 1. From this, we give two corollaries: any controlled Clifford circuit can be implemented with O(1) T-depth, and any Clifford+T circuit with T-depth D can be controlled with T-depth O(D), even without ancillas. As an application, we show how to catalyze a rotation by any angle up to precision $\u03b5$ in T-depth exactly 1 using a universal $\\lceil\\log_2(8/\u03b5)\\rceil$-qubit catalyst state.", "AI": {"tldr": "A controlled circuit with \u03a9(n\u00b2/log n) CNOT gates can be implemented with O(n) Toffoli gates and O(1) Toffoli depth.", "motivation": "Improving quantum circuit efficiency by reducing the number of Toffoli gates and depth is crucial for practical quantum computing applications, especially with the increasing number of qubits and the limited availability of Toffoli gates.", "method": "Through theoretical analysis and circuit optimization techniques, achieving O(n) Toffoli gates and O(1) depth.", "result": "Reduced Toffoli count and depth for controlled circuits lead to more efficient quantum operations.", "conclusion": "Optimized quantum circuits with fewer Toffoli gates and simpler depths enhance practical quantum computing capabilities."}}

Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670dADAPT-VQE\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f4e\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u68af\u5ea6\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
