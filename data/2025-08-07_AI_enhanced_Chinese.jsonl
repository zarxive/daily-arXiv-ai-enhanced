We compare\ntheir distinct interactions with H$_2$O and CO$_2$ through simultaneous thermal\ngravimetric, calorimetric, gas analysis and molecular modeling to evaluate\ntheir performance for dilute CO$_2$ separations like direct air capture.\nThermal and hybrid (heat + low-temperature hydration) desorption experiments\ndemonstrate that the QA-based sorbent binds both water and CO$_2$ more strongly\nthan the amine counterparts but undergoes degradation at moderate temperatures,\nlimiting its compatibility with thermal swing regeneration. However, a\nlow-temperature moisture-driven regeneration pathway at is uniquely effective\nfor the QA-based sorbent. To inform the energetics of a moisture-based CO$_2$\nseparation, we compare calorimetric water sorption enthalpies to isosteric\nenthalpies.

Molecular modeling supports\nthis observation, showing higher water sorption energies and denser charge\ndistributions in the QA-based sorbent. Mixed gas experiments in QA-based\nsorbent show that not only does water influence CO$_2$ binding, but CO$_2$\ninfluences water uptake through counterion-dependent hydration states, and that\nmoisture swing responsiveness in this material causes hydration-induced CO$_2$\nrelease and drying-induced CO$_2$ uptake, an important feature for low-energy\nCO$_2$ separation under ambient conditions. Overall, the two classes of\nsorbents offer distinct pathways for CO$_2$ separation.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems,\ngoverned by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological\nedge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors,\nwe map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes\nthe band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly\ndissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a\ntopologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s\nrigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property.

This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the\nvulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent.

The action is not\nbackground independent and the resulting effective field theory does not appear\nto have standard diffeomorphsim symmetry - instead there is an exotic gauge\nsymmetry that acts on some fields but not others. A new action is found that\nreduces to Sen's action in a certain limit and gives the same results as Sen's\ntheory for physical superstring amplitudes. However, the new theory is\nbackground independent: there is a shift symmetry so that a change in the\nbackground can be compensated for by a corresponding shift in the string\nfields. Sen's theory has two string fields leading to the physical interacting\nsuperstring plus a free superstring that decouples from the physical\nsuperstring. The new terms in the action give self-interactions to the second\nsuperstring which remains decoupled from the physical superstring. The two\nsuperstrings each have a graviton and the effective action for the two\ngravitons coupled to a background metric is studied and shown to be background\nindependent and diffeomorphism invariant, and the origin of further\ndiffeomorphism-like symmetries is explained.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a background-independent reformulation of Sen's superstring field theory, introducing a new action that addresses the unique features of Sen's theory, including symmetry issues and the presence of two superstring fields.

When the linear\npotential is temporally modulated, deviations in the trajectory of the droplet\nemerge relative to the static case, indicating potential applicability in\nprecision gravimetry. To further probe the dynamical coherence properties, we\ncompute the Shannon entropy and the Wigner quasi-probability distribution.

Just like\nevery other quantum circuit, these codes must be compiled to hardware in a way\nto minimize the total physical error introduced into the system, for example\neither due to high latency execution or excessive gates to meet connectivity\nlimitations of the target hardware. However, unlike arbitrary quantum circuits,\nall syndrome extraction circuits have several common properties, for example\nthey have a bipartite connectivity graph, consist only of commuting\nsubcircuits, among other properties. For the most part, compilation methods\nhave aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on\nthe hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and\nresult in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular\ntrapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of\nexcessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit\ninteractions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the\nstructural regularity of QEC circuits based on several key observations: 1.\nonly ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be\nexecuted in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a\nper-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to\nbegin a stabilizer measurement and retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles,\nand 4. QCCD hardware limits the number of parallel operations equal to the\nnumber traps in the system, meaning fewer ancilla are necessary and can be\nreused.

Our results confirm the existence of an\nnear-zero effective refractive index (NZERI) regime at the\n$\\Gamma\\text{-point}$ point in the photonic crystal approach. At this NZERI\nregime a consequence of triply degenerate eigenmodes in a certain frequency\nrange occurs when the effective refractive index of the metasurface approaches\nzero. Our central idea is that the NZERI regime in the all-dielectric\nmetasurface of a graphene substrate can be used to control, enhance, and modify\nthe propagation of SPPs. We applied several independent theoretical methods to\nobtain the effective refractive index of the metasurface at NZERI frequency\nrange for two-dimensional and three-dimensional metasurface structures with a\ngraphene layer.

We study the\nperturbations in a 3-parameter family of such EMDA theories. %The analysis is\nmore involved now, because of the %couplings of the gravitational and\nelectromagnetic modes %to both the dilaton and axion fields. The systems of\nequations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but\nthey can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a\n1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that\ndetermines the coupling of the axion to the $\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}\\,\nF_{\\mu\\nu}\\, F_{\\rho\\sigma}$ term. In the specific case when $b=1$, the theory\nis related to an ${\\cal N}=2$ supergravity. In this one case we find that the\nperturbations in the axial and the polar sectors are related by a remarkable\ntransformation, which generalises one found by Chandrasekhar for the\nperturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om in Einstein-Maxwell theory. This\ntransformation is of a form found in supersymmetric quantum mechanical models.\nThe existence of such mappings between the axial and polar perturbations\nappears to correlate with those cases where there is an underlying supergravity\nsupporting the solution, even though the black hole backgrounds are\nnon-extremal and therefore not supersymmetric. We prove the mode stability of\nthe static black hole solutions in the supersymmetric EMDA theory. For other\nvalues of the parameter $b$ in the EMDA theories that allow decoupling of the\nmodes, we find that one of the radial potentials can be negative outside the\nhorizon if $b$ is sufficiently large, raising the possibility of there being\nperturbative mode instabilities in such a case.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper extends previous work on black hole perturbations in EMD theories to include an axion, finding mode stability when b=1 and potential instabilities for larger b values through a transformation linking axial and polar perturbations.", "motivation": "Analyzing black hole perturbations helps understand their stability and potential instabilities which are crucial for testing theories of gravity and quantum mechanics.", "method": "Mathematical analysis of linear perturbations in EMDA theories with an axion field, establishing when the perturbations are stable based on parameter b.", "result": "Only when $b=1$ is the theory supported by supersymmetry and mode stability; larger b may lead to instability challenges.", "conclusion": "The perturbation analysis shows the importance of the parameter b in determining stability, particularly through a Chandrasekhar-like transformation."}}

It arises from\nJaynes' maximum-entropy principle as the maximally entropic state subject to\nlinear constraints, and is also the reduced state of the microcanonical state\non the system and a large environment. We formulate a maximum-channel-entropy\nprinciple, defining a thermal channel as one that maximizes a channel entropy\nmeasure subject to linear constraints on the channel. We prove that thermal\nchannels exhibit an exponential form reminiscent of thermal states. We study\nexamples including thermalizing channels that conserve a state's average\nenergy, as well as Pauli-covariant and classical channels. We propose a quantum\nchannel learning algorithm based on maximum channel entropy methods that\nmirrors a similar learning algorithm for quantum states. We then demonstrate\nthe thermodynamic relevance of the maximum-channel-entropy channel by proving\nthat it resembles the action on a single system of a microcanonical channel\nacting on many copies of the system. Here, the microcanonical channel is\ndefined by requiring that the linear constraints obey sharp statistics for any\ni.i.d. input state, including for noncommuting constraint operators. Our\ntechniques involve convex optimization methods to optimize recently introduced\nchannel entropy measures, typicality techniques involving noncommuting\noperators, a custom channel postselection technique, as well as Schur-Weyl\nduality. As a result of potential independent interest, we prove a constrained\npostselection theorem for quantum channels.

However, quantum mechanics permits events to occur in a superposition of\ncausal orders, providing new types of quantum resources for quantum information\ntasks. Previous demonstrations of indefinite causal order have relied on a\nprocess known as quantum switch and depended on specific assumptions about the\ndevices used in the laboratory. Recently, a theoretical scheme for the\ncertification of indefinite causal order in the quantum switch has been\nobtained solely from the output statistics of the devices, analogous to the\ndevice-independent proofs of nonlocality through violations of the Bell\ninequality. Here, we report an experimental verification of the causal\ninequality using spacelike-separated entangled photons, where one photon\nfunctions as the control qubit in a quantum switch and the other serves as an\nadditional observer. Through local measurement statistics, we observe a\nviolation of the causal inequality by 24 standard deviations.
