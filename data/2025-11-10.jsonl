Unless these\ntangent space dynamics are modified, the underlying chaotic dynamics will cause\nthe volume to vanish as tangent vectors collapse on the most expanding\ndirection. Here, we propose an alternative linearized dynamics and rectify the\ngeneralized Liouville equation to preserve phase space volume, even for\nnon-Hamiltonian systems. Within a classical density matrix theory, we define\nthe time evolution operator from the anti-symmetric part of the stability\nmatrix so that phase space volume is time-invariant. The operator generates\northogonal transformations without distorting volume elements, providing an\ninvariant measure for dissipative dynamics and a evolution equation for the\ndensity matrix akin to the quantum mechanical Liouville-von Neumann equation.\nThe compressibility of volume elements is determined by a non-orthogonal\noperator made from the symmetric part of the stability matrix. We analyze\ncomplete sets of basis vectors for the tangent space dynamics of chaotic\nsystems, which may be dissipative, transient or driven, without\nre-orthogonalization of tangent vectors. The linear harmonic oscillator, the\nLorenz-Fetter model, and the H\\'enon-Heiles system demonstrate the computation\nof the instantaneous Lyapunov exponent spectrum and the local Gibbs entropy\nflow rate using these bases and show that it is numerically convenient."}

Our simulations are performed for excitation of the strongly bound\nintralayer exciton of an inversion-symmetric homobilayer of MoS2 with in-plane\nelectric fields. We demonstrate that for resonant excitation at the 1s\nK-exciton the SHG and the THG show complex dependencies on both the strength of\nthe static field and the peak amplitude of the optical pulse. For sufficiently\nintense optical excitation, the THG increases and the SHG increases\nsuperlinearly with the amplitude of the static field as long as exciton\nionization is not yet dominating. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that\nthese dependencies arise from an interplay between several effects including\nstatic and transient Stark shifts, exciton ionization, Wannier-Stark\nlocalization, off-resonant Rabi oscillations, and a modified interference\nbetween optical nonlinearities induced by the intraband acceleration.

In this work, we focus on studying the effects of\naccelerated irradiation by maintaining constant neutron fluence while varying\nneutron flux, which results in different lead factors. This approach enables\nthe extrapolation of accelerated test results to real operational conditions of\nthe reactor pressure vessels. In our study, we analyzed irradiated steels using\nthree magnetic techniques. Each technique responds differently to the\nmicrostructural changes induced by irradiation, allowing for a better\ncharacterization of its effects on the material. Through DC magnetometry, the\nanalysis of minor loops shows that the remanence, coercivity, and saturation of\nthe steel depend not only on the fluence with which the material was irradiated\nbut also on the irradiation rate, which means, more specifically, on the lead\nfactor. The AC susceptibility technique shows that the response of the\nirradiated steel to the applied magnetic field increases with fluence but also\nwith the lead factor. For the real part of XAC, there is an increase with the\nlead factor, while the imaginary component of XAC grows with the size of the\nnanoprecipitates.

Prevailing approaches either simulate the\nstochastic differential equations governing the forward dynamics of underlying\nasset prices or directly solve the backward pricing partial differential\nequation.

The\natoms are trapped in counter-rotating azimuthal optical lattices, formed by\ninterfering evanescent fields of laser modes injected into circular PIC\nwaveguides. We develop quantum models for the radial and azimuthal dynamics of\nthe interfering atoms in adiabatic frames, which provide computational\nefficiency. The theory is applied to an exemplary PIC, for which we first\ncompute field modes and atom trapping potentials for $^{87}$Rb. We then\nevaluate non-adiabaticity, fidelity, and sensitivity of the exemplary PIC."}
