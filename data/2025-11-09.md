*Denuwan Vithanage,Skyler Wright,Edith Luveina-Joseph,Christopher Larson,Edward Carlo Samson*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: Fast spatial transport of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity (STA) by counterdiabatic driving (CD) was studied numerically. The transport efficiency and time were compared and simulated using the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fast transport of BEC under various conditions is crucial for applications in quantum technologies and exploring quantum mechanics.

Method: Numerical simulations were conducted using the counterdiabatic driving (CD) method in conjunction with shortcuts-to-adiabaticity (STA). The transport efficiency and time were analyzed by simulating the trapping potential and auxiliary potential using the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE).

Result: The simulations revealed that a minimum transport time is essential for fast transport, consistent with findings in quantum speed limit studies.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into optimizing the transport of trapped BECs using CD and STA, emphasizing the role of minimum transport time in achieving efficient transport.

Abstract: We numerically study the fast spatial transport of a trapped Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity (STA) by counterdiabatic
driving (CD). The trapping potential and the required auxiliary potential were
simulated as painted potentials. We compared STA transport to transport that
follows a constant-acceleration scheme (CA). Experimentally feasible values of
trap depth and atom number were used in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE)
simulations. Different transport times, trap depths, and trap lengths were
investigated. In all simulations, there exists a minimum amount of time
necessary for fast transport, which is consistent with previous results from
quantum speed limit studies.

### [2] [Stability of dark solitons in a bubble Bose-Einstein condensate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04385)
*Raphael Wictky Sallatti,Lauro Tomio,Dmitry Pelinovsky,Arnaldo Gammal*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: Dark solitons on a spherical Bose-Einstein condensate become unstable when the interaction parameter exceeds approximately 8.37, leading to snake instabilities that form vortex dipoles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stability of dark solitons in different geometries, like spherical Bose-Einstein condensates, is crucial for various applications in quantum physics and optics.

Method: The analysis involved deriving equations for the dynamics of dark solitons on a sphere, identifying unstable angular modes, and conducting numerical simulations to confirm the formation of vortex dipoles.

Result: For each angular mode m ≥ 2, there is exactly one unstable mode, and the number of vortex dipoles corresponds to m.

Conclusion: The research highlights the critical interaction parameter beyond which dark solitons become unstable, providing insights into the behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates under strong interactions.

Abstract: The dynamic stability of dark solitons trapped on the surface of a
two-dimensional spherical bubble is investigated. In this spherical geometry of
the Bose-Einstein condensate, dark solitons are found to be unstable for the
interaction parameter ${\epsilon} \gtrsim 8.37$, since discrete angular modes
drive snake instabilities, with the generation of vortex dipoles. We show
analytically and numerically that, for each angular mode $m \ge 2$, there
exists exactly one unstable mode whose dominance determines the number m of
vortex dipoles. Time-dependent simulations confirm the formation of vortex
dipoles.

### [3] [Enhancement of magnon flux toward a Bose-Einstein condensate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04387)
*Franziska Kühn,Matthias R. Schweizer,Tamara Azevedo,Vitaliy I. Vasyuchka,Georg von Freymann,Victor S. L'vov,Burkard Hillebrands,Alexander A. Serga*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Yttrium Iron Garnet薄膜中角度依赖的参数泵Magnon传输机制， focus on 将参数注入的Magnon向Bose-Einstein凝结点转移的机制。通过经典哈密顿形式，分析了参数不稳定性阈值作为微波泵场与外磁场角度的函数，并连续地描述了平行和正交泵之间过渡。还描述了两种相互竞争的四Magnon散射机制，它们将参数Magnon向频率谱最低点转移。实验部分使用了微焦点布里ouin光散射光谱仪和矢量磁铁，实现了对Magnon人口谱的角度分辨率Mapping。观察到，正交泵尽管有更高的不稳定阈值，但在谱最低点的Magnon人口却明显强于平行泵。这些结果表明，动能不稳定渠道在通过泵送使Magnon到达凝结点方面起主导作用。这些发现揭示了泵送几何对Magnon分布的重要性，并为优化Magnon到凝结体的流量提供了指导，有助于进一步控制Magnon Bose-Einstein凝聚在磁体中。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research interest lies in the manipulation of magnons for potential applications in spintronics and quantum information processing. The study of magnon Bose-Einstein condensation (MBEC) is crucial for understanding quantum phenomena at the microscale and has implications for novel quantum devices.

Method: The study combines theoretical and experimental approaches. Theoretically, it employs a classical Hamiltonian formalism to analyze parametric instability thresholds and scattering mechanisms. Experimentally, it uses microfocused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy combined with a vector magnet to perform angle-resolved mapping of the magnon population spectrum under controlled pumping angles.

Result: The key findings reveal that the transfer of parametrically injected magnons to the spectral minimum is strongly influenced by the pumping geometry. Transverse pumping, despite having a higher instability threshold, results in a significantly higher population of magnons at the spectral minimum compared to parallel pumping.

Conclusion: The research provides a detailed understanding of the mechanisms controlling the transfer of magnons to the spectral minimum under different pumping geometries. These findings are crucial for optimizing magnon flux into Bose-Einstein condensates and advancing the control of MBEC in magnetic insulators, with potential implications for spintronic and quantum information technologies.

Abstract: We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of angle-dependent
parametric pumping of magnons in Yttrium Iron Garnet films, with a focus on the
mechanisms that transfer parametrically injected magnons toward the spectral
minimum where Bose-Einstein condensation occurs. Using a classical Hamiltonian
formalism, we analyze the threshold conditions for parametric instability as a
function of the angle between the microwave pumping field and the external
magnetic field, continuously tracing the transition between parallel and
transverse pumping. We also describe two competing four-magnon scattering
mechanisms that transfer parametric magnons toward the bottom of their
frequency spectrum: The step-by-step Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade, which is
allowed for all magnetic field values, and the kinetic instability mechanisms
that provide a much more efficient single-step channel in transferring magnons
directly to the lowest-energy states, but occurs within specific regions of the
pumping angle and the external magnetic field where the conservation laws
permit it. In the experimental part, we employ microfocused Brillouin light
scattering spectroscopy in combination with a vector magnet, allowing for
angle-resolved mapping of the magnon population spectrum under controlled
pumping angle. We observe that transverse pumping, although characterized by a
higher instability threshold, yields a markedly stronger population at the
spectral minimum compared to parallel pumping. These observations demonstrate
that the kinetic instability channel plays a dominant role in transferring
magnons to the spectral minimum under such conditions. These results reveal the
crucial role of pumping geometry in shaping the magnon distribution and provide
guidelines for optimizing the flux of magnons into the condensate, thereby
advancing the control of magnon Bose-Einstein condensation in magnetic
insulators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the superfluid properties of a two-dimensional,
weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in the zero-temperature regime,
when it is subjected to a triangular optical lattice potential. We implement an
original method, which involves solving the hydrodynamic continuity equation to
extract the superfluid fraction tensor from the measured in situ density
distribution of the fluid at rest. In parallel, we apply an independent
dynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity
measurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield
consistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured
density profiles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Theoretical predictions of photochemical processes are essential for
interpreting and understanding spectral features. Reliable quantum dynamics
calculations of vibronic systems require precise modeling of anharmonic effects
in the potential energy surfaces and off-diagonal nonadiabatic coupling terms.
In this work, we present the n-mode quantization of all vibronic Hamiltonian
terms comprised of general high-dimensional model representations. This results
in a second-quantized framework for accurate vibronic calculations employing
the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We demonstrate the accuracy
and reliability of this approach by calculating the excited state quantum
dynamics of maleimide. We analyze convergence and the choice of parameters of
the underlying time-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm
for the n-mode vibronic Hamiltonian, demonstrating that it enables accurate
calculations of complex photochemical dynamics.

Method: 通过使用多项式转换的哈密顿量，推导出适用于所有温度和光场时间标的学生化化率相关函数表达式。采用有效布朗振子谱密度考虑腔体损失，获得了适用于耗能腔体的闭合表达式。

Result: 在高温极限下，恢复了Marcus和Marcus-Jortner的结果；在低温极限下，揭示了能量间隙定律。此外，还可以考虑腔体损失，推导出适用于耗能腔体的闭合表达式，并展示了腔体限制导致的共振效应和电子转移引起的光子发射现象。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解受限电磁场如何重塑电荷转移动力学提供了通用的框架，并为控制和观察电荷转移反应提供了新机会，特别是在微纳光子环境下。

Abstract: With the rapid development of nanophotonics and cavity quantum
electrodynamics, there has been growing interest in how confined
electromagnetic fields modify fundamental molecular processes such as electron
transfer. In this paper, we revisit the problem of nonadiabatic electron
transfer (ET) in confined electromagnetic fields studied in [J. Chem. Phys.
150, 174122 (2019)] and present a unified rate theory based on Fermi's golden
rule (FGR). By employing a polaron-transformed Hamiltonian, we derive analytic
expressions for the ET rate correlation functions that are valid across all
temperature regimes and all cavity mode time scales. In the high-temperature
limit, our formalism recovers the Marcus and Marcus-Jortner results, while in
the low-temperature limit it reveals the emergence of the energy gap law. We
further extend the theory to include cavity loss by using an effective Brownian
oscillator spectral density, which enables closed-form expressions for the ET
rate in lossy cavities. As applications, we demonstrate two key cavity-induced
phenomena: (i) resonance effects, where the ET rate is strongly enhanced at
certain cavity mode frequencies, and (ii) electron-transfer-induced photon
emission, arising from the population of cavity photon Fock states during the
ET process. These results establish a general framework for understanding how
confined electromagnetic fields reshape charge transfer dynamics, and suggest
novel opportunities for controlling and probing ET reactions in nanophotonic
environments.

TL;DR: GNOF和其修改版本GNOFm在捕捉动力电离相关性方面表现良好且无需额外修正或有限活跃空间选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望探索更简单的量子化学方法来准确描述动力电离相关性。

Method: 采用GNOF和GNOFm进行比较研究，使用十二个五、六元环分子作为测试集，这些分子具有主要的动力电离相关性。

Result: GNOF和GNOFm在完整基底极限相关性能量计算方面表现优异，GNOFm在某些方面有小的改进。

Conclusion: GNOF家族在捕捉动力电离相关性方面表现可靠且有效。

Abstract: The Global Natural Orbital Functional (GNOF) provides a straightforward
approach to capture most electron correlation effects without needing
perturbative corrections or limited active spaces selection. In this work, we
evaluate both the original GNOF and its modified variant GNOFm on a set of
twelve 5- and 6-membered molecular rings, systems characterized primarily by
dynamic correlation. This reference set is vital as it comprises essential
substructures of more complex molecules. We report complete-basis-set limit
correlation energies for GNOF, GNOFm, and the benchmark CCSD(T) method. Across
the Dunning basis sets, both functionals deliver a balanced and accurate
description of the molecular set, with GNOFm showing small but systematic
improvements while preserving the overall robustness of the original
formulation. These results confirm the reliability of the GNOF family and its
ability to capture dynamic correlation effects.

*Dimitri N. Laikov*

Result: 简化方法与原VV10泛函同样准确，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 文章提出了一种有效的计算优化方法，适用于处理分子体系，加快了相关计算。

Abstract: A simplification of the VV10 van der Waals density functional [J. Chem. Phys.
133, 244103 (2010)] is made by an approximation of the integrand of the
six-dimentional integral in terms of a few products of three-dimensional
density-like distributions and potential-like functions of the interelectronic
distance only, opening the way for its straightforward computation by fast
multipole methods. An even faster computational scheme for molecular systems is
implemented where the density-like distributions are fitted by linear
combinations of usual atom-centered basis functions of Gaussian type and the
six-dimensional integral is then computed analytically, at a fraction of the
overall cost of a typical calculation. The simplicity of the new approximation
is commensurate with that of the original VV10 functional, and the same level
of accuracy is seen in tests on molecules.

*Jacob F. Steiner,Larissa Melischek,Felix von Oppen*

TL;DR: A generalized RCSJ model for Josephson junctions is derived, accounting for nonlinear currents and supercurrents with arbitrary phase relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies on Josephson diodes suggest the need for a beyond-RCSJ model to account for nonlinear effects.

Method: Generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem is applied to derive the new model, extending the traditional RCSJ framework.

Result: The new model incorporates nonlinear currents and arbitrary current-phase relations, broadening its applicability.

Conclusion: This advancement enhances modeling of complex superconducting devices beyond the tunneling limit.

Abstract: The dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson
junction can be described within the resistively and capacitively shunted
Josephson junction (RCSJ) model. Microscopic derivations of this model
traditionally rely on the tunneling limit. Here, we present a derivation of a
generalized version of the RCSJ model, which accounts for dissipative currents
with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics as well as supercurrents with
arbitrary current-phase relations. This requires a generalized
fluctuation-dissipation theorem to describe the Langevin current, which we
deduce along the lines of fluctuation theorems for mesoscopic conductors. Our
work is motivated in particular by recent theories of the Josephson diode
effect, which is not captured within the RCSJ model in the tunneling limit.

### [10] [Unconventional quantization of 2D plasmons in cavities formed by gate slots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03829)
*Ilia Moiseenko,Olga Polischuk,Viacheslav Muravev,Dmitry Svintsov*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 我们展示了一个平行金属栅Above在二维电子系统（2DES）之间的间隙形成一个具有非常规模式量子化的等离子体腔室。当栅槽宽度L和等离子体波长λ满足条件L = λ/8 + n × λ/2（n=0,1,2...）时，等离子体模式被激发。最低激发波长仅为λ/8，与光学常见的半波长法拉第-Пер overturn cavities不同。这种独特的量子化规则源于2D等离子体在反射边缘时获得的非平凡相移-π/4。栅槽中的等离子体模式对封闭栅档区的2DES的泄漏衰减率很弱，衰减率与栅与2DES之间的距离平方根成正比。不匹配策略下，这些通道的吸收截面积达到~50%的理论上最小极限，而增强效应对加强边的场进行了放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究平行金属栅在2DES之间的等离子体腔室模式具有理论和实验意义，特别是在超导量子计算和量子信息处理方面。该发现为更高效的小尺寸等离子体腔室设计提供了新的思路，为未来开发更紧凑的微电子和光学器件提供了线索。

Method: 通过电子散射理论和电动力学分析，计算了2D等离子体在金属栅边缘的反射相位，导出了量子化条件，并在此基础上推导了等离子体模式的特性。实验中引入了微分电荷面密度和阻力效应，测量了等离子体泄漏和吸收特性。此外，材料键盘的微极化效应也被考虑在内，确保分析与实验结果相符。

Result: 关键结果包括:*) 新型等离子体腔室的首Resonant模式在λ/8间隔情况下激发，这是不同于传统0.5λ法拉第-Пер overturn cavities的特点。*) -π/4相移在等离子体反射后得以实现。*) 等离子体模式的泄漏衰减率随栅与其他结构之间距离的增加而显著增加，其平方行为被实例化。*) 吸收截面积达到约50%，在不采用配对策略的情况下接近理论上限。这些结果为小型等离子体腔室的应用提供了理论基础和设计参考。

Conclusion: 我们在平行金属栅上开发了一种新的等离子体腔室结构，其量子化特性具有非传统性，且在小尺寸下具有显著的吸收特性。这些发现对理解等离子体腔室物理、以及设计紧凑微结构器件具有重要的意义。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above
two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with
unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when
the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition
$L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest
resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth
of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional
half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule
arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon
upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak
decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the
square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption
cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit
without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the
metal edges.

Conclusion: 本文展示了 memristor 基础算法与硬件协同设计对于实现低功耗、可扩展 neuromorphic 硬件的关键作用。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of memristor based neural networks trained with
the hardware-friendly Manhattan update rule, focusing on the trade offs between
learning performance and energy consumption. Using realistic models of
potentiation/depression (P/D) curves, we evaluate the impact of nonlinearity
(NLI), conductance range, and number of accessible levels on both a single
perceptron (SP) and a deep neural network (DNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.
Our results show that SPs tolerate P/D nonlinearity up to NLI $\leq 0.01$,
while DNNs require stricter conditions of NLI $\leq$ 0.001 to preserve
accuracy. Increasing the number of discrete conductance states improves
convergence, effectively acting as a finer learning rate. We further propose a
strategy where one memristor of each differential pair is fixed, reducing
redundant memristor conductance updates. This approach lowers training energy
by nearly 50% in DNN with little to no loss in accuracy. Our findings highlight
the importance of device algorithm codesign in enabling scalable, low power
neuromorphic hardware for edge AI applications.

Abstract: Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band
singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the
emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously
uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them
in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian
generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that
characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of
the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved
polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band
two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access
to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian
quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted
to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in
flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall
physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide
phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and
non-Abelian physics.

*Tarik P. Cysne,Ivo Souza,Tatiana G. Rappoport*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states is presented, including the Berry connection term in k-derivatives, which was previously omitted. The formula applies to any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. Two new contributions are identified: one restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states, while the other provides significant quantitative corrections depending on the system. The impact on the orbital Hall effect in bilayer systems, such as 2H transition metal dichalcogenides and biased bilayer graphene, is examined, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections. Our findings contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and the conceptual foundations of orbitronics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill a gap in the rigorous derivation of OMM matrix elements by including the Berry connection term, which has implications for understanding the orbital Hall effect in bilayer systems and the development of orbitronics.

Method: The method involves deriving the OMM matrix elements from first principles, including the Berry connection term, and applying the formula to bilayer systems to demonstrate its impact on the orbital Hall effect.

Result: The inclusion of the Berry connection term restores gauge covariance and provides significant corrections to the OMM matrix elements. These corrections reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau in bilayer systems, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials are particularly susceptible to these effects. The findings enhance the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and support the conceptual foundations of orbitronics.

Conclusion: The derived OMM corrections are important for understanding the orbital Hall effect in bilayer systems and the development of orbitronics. The inclusion of the Berry connection term is crucial for achieving a rigorous derivation and for accurately modeling the electronic properties of multi-layered materials.

Abstract: We present a rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital
magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states. Our calculations include the Berry
connection term in the k-derivatives of Bloch states, which was omitted in
previous works. The resulting formula for the OMM matrix elements applies to
any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. We identify two new
contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states,
while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant
quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their
impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal
dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new
terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that
neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be
particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections. Our findings may
contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and to the
conceptual foundations of the emerging field of orbitronics.

Abstract: We analyze the thermal and electrical characteristics of the metasurface
consisting of
  the coplanar interdigital array of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected
by nanobridges (NBs). These nanobridges could be implemented using graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs), single-wall semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or
black-arsenic-phosphorus (b-AsP) nanostructures. The bias voltage applied
between neighboring GMRs indices electron and hole two-dimensional systems in
the GMRs and induces thermionic currents flowing through connecting NBs. The
resulting self-heating increases thermionic currents providing an effective
positive feadback between the carrier effective temperature and the injected
currents. This mechanism may lead to thermal breakdown enabling threshold
behavior of current-voltage characteristics and resulting in the S-shape of
these characteristics. The devices based on the GMR/GNR, GMR/CNT, and GMR/AsP
metasurface structures can be used as fast voltage-controlled current switches,
sensors, thermal terahertz and infrared sources, and other devices.

Abstract: Arrays of bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons have emerged as a
promising platform for simulating classical XY models, capable of rapidly
reaching phase-locked states that may be mapped to arrays of two-dimensional
classical spins. However, it remains unclear whether these states genuinely
minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how the convergence time scales
with the system size. Here, we develop an analytical model revealing that an
array of $N$ condensates possesses $N$ stable phase configurations. The system
selectively amplifies a specific configuration dependent on the pump power: at
low power, the state with the smallest eigenvalue of an effective XY
Hamiltonian is favored, while at high power, the state with the largest
eigenvalue prevails. At intermediate pump powers, the system visits all
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Crucially, the formation rate for any of these
phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, independent of the size of
the array, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of
polariton-based XY simulators.

Abstract: Hydrocarbon contamination is an ever-present factor to consider in surface
science measurements. In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the
structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a
self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to
ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic
investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the
effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated
surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer
suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a
long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent.
Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the
current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by
a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from
extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel
junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on
the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence
of surface contamination in STM measurements.

Abstract: Monolayers of group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are
two-dimensional semiconductors that exhibit exceptionally strong light-matter
coupling yet typically suffer from low emission quantum yields. In this letter,
we investigate the heavily n-doped regime of a WSe$_2$ monolayer and show that
multi-particle excitonic complexes produce photoluminescence signals up to two
orders of magnitude stronger than in the neutral state. Time-resolved
photoluminescence and differential reflectivity measurements reveal that the
quantum yield rises with carrier density and exceeds 50% for electron
concentrations above 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. These findings establish TMD
monolayers as a platform for exploring excitonic complexes in high-density
electron gases and point toward new opportunities for efficient, atomically
thin light emitters.

Abstract: Quantum simulators enable studies of many-body phenomena which are
intractable with classical hardware. Spins in devices based on semiconductor
quantum dots promise precise electrical control and scalability advantages, but
accessing many-body phenomena has so far been restricted by challenges in
nanofabrication and simultaneous control of multiple interactions. Here, we
perform spectroscopy of up to eight interacting spins using a 2x4 array of
gate-defined germanium quantum dots. The spectroscopy protocol is based on
Ramsey interferometry and adiabatic mapping of many-body eigenstates to
single-spin eigenstates, enabling a complete energy spectrum reconstruction. As
the interaction strength exceeds magnetic disorder, we observe signatures of
the crossover from localization to a chaotic phase marking a step towards the
observation of many-body phenomena in quantum dot systems.

Abstract: Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent
driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to
nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to
manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart
of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive
heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum
dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached.
However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine,
such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of
the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising
efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum
dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal
machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent
asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to
engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its
performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate
transmission level.

Abstract: Multiscale dynamical systems characterized by interacting fast and slow
processes are ubiquitous across scientific domains, from climate dynamics to
fluid mechanics. Accurate modeling of such systems requires capturing both the
long-term statistical properties governed by slow variables and the short-term
transient dynamics driven by fast chaotic processes. We present a hybrid
data-driven framework that integrates score-based generative modeling with
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to construct reduced-order
models (ROMs) capable of reproducing both regimes. The slow dynamics are
represented by a Langevin equation whose drift is informed by a score function
learned via the K-means Gaussian Mixture Model (KGMM) method, ensuring faithful
reproduction of the system's invariant measure. The fast chaotic forcing is
modeled by a NODE trained on delay-embedded residuals extracted from observed
trajectories, replacing conventional Gaussian noise approximations. We validate
this approach on a hierarchy of prototypical metastable systems driven by
Lorenz 63 dynamics, including bistable potentials with additive and
multiplicative forcing, and tristable non-autonomous systems with cycloperiodic
components. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid framework maintains
statistical consistency over long time horizons while accurately forecasting
rare critical transitions between metastable states with lead times approaching
the Lyapunov time of the chaotic driver. This work establishes a principled
methodology for combining statistical closure techniques with explicit
surrogate models of fast dynamics, offering a pathway toward predictive
modeling of complex multiscale phenomena where both long-term statistics and
short-term transients are essential.

Abstract: Multistability, the coexistence of multiple stable states, is a cornerstone
of nonlinear dynamical systems, governing their equilibrium, tunability, and
emergent complexity. Recently, the concept of hidden multistability, where
certain stable states evade detection via conventional continuous parameter
sweeping, has garnered increasing attention due to its elusive nature and
promising applications. In this Letter, we present the first experimental
observation of hidden multistability using a programmable acoustic
coupled-cavity platform that integrates competing self-focusing and
self-defocusing Kerr nonlinearities. Beyond established bistability, we
demonstrate semi- and fully-hidden tristabilities by precisely programming
system parameters. Crucially, the hidden stable states, typically inaccessible
via the traditional protocol, are unambiguously revealed and dynamically
controlled through pulsed excitation, enabling flexible transitions between
distinct types of stable states. These experimental findings not only offer new
insights into the fundamental physics of emerging hidden multistability, but
also unlock new avenues for applications in information storage, information
encryption, and safety precaution, where multi-state dynamics could enable
advanced control techniques.

Abstract: We investigate energy propagation in a one-dimensional stub lattice in the
presence of both disorder and nonlinearity. In the periodic case, the stub
lattice hosts two dispersive bands separated by a flat band; however, we show
that sufficiently strong disorder fills all intermediate band gaps. By mapping
the two-dimensional parameter space of disorder and nonlinearity, we identify
three distinct dynamical regimes (weak chaos, strong chaos, and self-trapping)
through numerical simulations of initially localized wave packets. When
disorder is strong enough to close the frequency gaps, the results closely
resemble those obtained in the one-dimensional disordered discrete nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Klein-Gordon lattice model. In particular,
subdiffusive spreading is observed in both the weak and strong chaos regimes,
with the second moment $m_2$ of the norm distribution scaling as $m_2 \propto
t^{0.33}$ and $m_2 \propto t^{0.5}$, respectively. The system's chaotic
behavior follows a similar trend, with the finite-time maximum Lyapunov
exponent $\Lambda$ decaying as $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.25}$ and $\Lambda \propto
t^{-0.3}$. For moderate disorder strengths, i.e., near the point of gap
closing, we find that the presence of small frequency gaps does not exert any
noticeable influence on the spreading behavior. Our findings extend the
characterization of nonlinear disordered lattices in both weak and strong chaos
regimes to other network geometries, such as the stub lattice, which serves as
a representative flat-band system.

TL;DR: 对锁定 Murray 结构的分支半径规律进行了总结，提出了EPIC理论，通过将分支选择视为在固定成本和收益下的最优化，即最大化熵通流量每比特代价，得出了半径正比于 r^alpha 的结论，其中 alpha 的值取决于半径在体积和表面积上的价格权重。


<details>

Motivation: 了解生物体内血管或管道网络的最优结构有助于理解自然选择和适应性，进而指导工程设计中的优化。

Method: 通过熵产生（EP）和信息成本（IC）的度量，定义了EPIC比价，将分支选择建模为一种约束优化问题，采用拉格朗日乘数法求解出最优分支比，最终推导出 Murray 定律的扩展形式。

Result: 分支比的幂律指数 alpha 由径向半径的体积和表面积的价格加权决定，分别对应 alpha =3（体积主导）和alpha=2.5（表面积主导），这两种情况都满足流体动力学的基本守恒，从而推导出一种混合定价的通用 Murray 定律。

Conclusion: 通过EPIC框架，将分支选择过程建模为具有经济类比意义的最优化问题，不仅扩展了传统的Murray定律，还能通过实证检验来验证理论的有效性。这种方法为设计符合自然能量效率的管道系统提供了新的工具和思路。

Abstract: At steady laminar Y-junctions (Murray family), the observed branching-radius
law follows from a single ratio extremum: entropy production per information
cost (EPIC). Structure is priced by an effective bit energy Eb,eff = zeta k_B T
ln 2 (J per bit); normalizing viscous entropy production by this tariff defines
an information-priced entropy flux Phi_b = sigma_s / Eb,eff. Extremizing at
fixed demands gives Q proportional to r^alpha with alpha = (m+4)/2 and the node
rule r0^alpha = r1^alpha + r2^alpha, where m encodes how the tariff scales with
radius (m=2 volume-priced -> alpha = 3; m=1 surface-priced -> alpha = 2.5).
Mixed surface/volume pricing implies a local alpha_eff in the range 2.5-3
without changing the fluid physics and leads to a weighted Murray law for
heterogeneous tariffs. The ratio extremum is equivalent to an additive
functional via fractional programming (Dinkelbach) and reduces, for uniform
tariffs, to the familiar near-equilibrium extremum of classical theory (minimum
entropy production). The framework is falsifiable: measure how stabilized-bit
counts and the overhead zeta scale with radius, and alpha must track (m+4)/2.
EPIC recasts branching selection as maximizing entropy throughput per paid bit
and provides a platform-agnostic lever to predict and tune morphology.

Abstract: One of the surprising, and potentially very useful, capabilities of analog
quantum computers, such as D-Wave quantum annealers, is sampling from the
Boltzmann, or Gibbs, distribution defined by a classical Hamiltonian. In this
study, we thoroughly examine the ability of D-Wave quantum annealers to sample
from the Boltzmann distribution defined of a canonical type of competing
magnetic frustration $J_1$-$J_2$ model; the ANNNI (axial next-nearest-neighbor
Ising) model. Boltzmann sampling error rate is quantified for standard
linear-ramp anneals ranging from $5$ nanosecond annealing times up to $2000$
microseconds on two different D-Wave quantum annealing processors.
Interestingly, we find some analog hardware parameters which result in a very
high accuracy (down to a TVD of $0.0003$) and low temperature sampling (down to
$\beta=32.2$) in a frustrated region of the ANNNI model magnetic phase diagram.
This bolsters the viability of current analog quantum computers for
thermodynamic sampling applications of highly frustrated magnetic spin systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) for simulating quantum dynamics, finds that TE scales volumetrically with evolution time for chaotic 1D quantum circuits, and concludes that local observables' rapid thermalization reconciles with IM's high complexity through non-Markovian dynamics, which can be coarse-grained into an area-law IM-MPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the scaling of influence matrices in quantum dynamics is crucial for developing efficient simulation methods, particularly in many-body systems and quantum computing.

Method: The authors solve a random-unitary bath model exactly and use bounds on distillable entanglement to determine TE scaling. They also employ analytical methods for kicked Ising models and numerical simulations elsewhere.

Result: TE shows volume-law scaling for chaotic 1D quantum circuits but transitions to an area-law IM under coarse-graining, implying local dynamics are captured efficiently.

Conclusion: The analysis indicates that local temporal correlations are primarily responsible for TE scaling, supporting the use of efficient IM methods like MPS for simulations.

Abstract: Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a
measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a
many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently
argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law)
scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM
with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation
between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic
quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding
distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue
that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine
non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex
temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is
negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of
measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to
area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d
circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary
points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that
dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide
evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms
accurately describes local evolution.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the first-order Trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model is integrable, and that the discrete time step can be controlled using an inhomogeneous transfer matrix. It also shows that the Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry is preserved under discretization, leading to mappings between different Trotterizations and extending the results to finite-time Floquet evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the integrability and symmetry properties of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing both theoretical frameworks and potential applications in quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method: The authors use the quantum inverse scattering method to construct an inhomogeneous transfer matrix, which allows them to control the discrete time step. They also analyze the effects of discretizing both space and time, particularly on the Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry.

Result: The key findings include the demonstration of integrability for the first-order Trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model, the construction of discrete time conserved quantities, and the preservation of the Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry under discretization. The doubling of these duality operators under discretization is also a significant result.

Conclusion: This work provides a deeper understanding of the integrability and symmetry properties of the Ising model under discrete time evolution. The results are relevant for both fundamental studies and potential applications in quantum dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Integrable trotterization provides a method to evolve a continuous time
integrable many-body system in discrete time, such that it retains its
conserved quantities. Here we explicitly show that the first order
trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model is integrable. The
discrete time conserved quantities are obtained from an inhomogeneous transfer
matrix constructed using the quantum inverse scattering method. The
inhomogeneity parameter determines the discrete time step. We then focus on the
non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for the trotterized evolution.
We find that the discretization of both space and time leads to a doubling of
these duality operators. They account for discrete translations in both space
and time. As an interesting application, we find that these operators also
provide maps between trotterizations of different orders. This helps us extend
our results beyond the trotterization scheme and investigate the
Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for finite time Floquet evolution of the
critical transverse field Ising chain.

### [29] [Realistic GKP stabilizer states enable universal quantum computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03874)
*Fariba Hosseinynejad,Pavithran Iyer,Guillaume Dauphinais,David L. Feder*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Normalizable GKP stabilizer states can be used to implement non-Clifford gates in a measurement-based quantum computation framework using Gaussian operations and homodyne measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to demonstrate a novel method for achieving universal quantum computation using continuous-variable systems, specifically focusing on GKP states.

Method: The method involves using imperfect, or normalizable, GKP stabilizer states along with Gaussian operations and homodyne measurements to implement quantum gates.

Result: The authors show that this approach allows for the implementation of non-Clifford gates, which are essential for universal quantum computation.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for achieving computational universality in measurement-based quantum computing using continuous-variable systems.

Abstract: Physical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are inherently noisy as ideal
ones would require infinite energy. While this is typically considered as a
deficiency to be actively corrected, this work demonstrates that imperfect GKP
stabilizer states can be leveraged in order to apply non-Clifford gates using
only linear optical elements. In particular, Gaussian operations on
normalizable GKP states, combined with homodyne measurements, permit two key
primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates in the normalizable GKP
codespace, thereby implementing Clifford gates with high fidelity; and
probabilistic projection of unmeasured modes onto non-Pauli eigenstates. These
results demonstrate that normalizable GKP stabilizer states combined with
Gaussian operations provide a practical framework for computational
universality within the measurement-based model of quantum computation in a
realistic continuous-variable setting.

*Hans Peter Büchler,Tobias F. Maier,Simon Fell,Nicolai Lang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper presents a method for constructing Hamiltonians that realize topological orders using Rydberg atoms as a platform, showing that exactly solvable models of topologically ordered phases with non-abelian anyons can be achieved with experimentally realistic two-body interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying topological phases of matter is important for understanding new states of matter and potential applications in quantum computing. The inverse problem of engineering Hamiltonians to realize desired topological phases is particularly challenging and relevant.

Method:  the authors use a platform of Rydberg atoms, which are atoms in highly excited energy states that can interact collectively. They employ blockade interactions, where Rydberg atoms in neighboring sites cannot simultaneously be excited, enabling interactions between two-level systems.

Result:  the paper successfully designs Hamiltonians that realize topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models for arbitrary finite groups G. The authors analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state and provide efficient schemes for preparing these states. They also introduce protocols for adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their non-abelian statistics, illustrated for the simplest non-abelian quantum double D(S3).

Conclusion:  this work provides a general framework for engineering topological phases of matter using Rydberg atoms. The approach opens new avenues for exploring and potentially realizing non-abelian anyons in experimental systems, which could have implications for quantum computing and other applications.

Abstract: Exactly solvable models of topologically ordered phases with non-abelian
anyons typically require complicated many-body interactions which do not
naturally appear in nature. This motivates the "inverse problem" of quantum
many-body physics: given microscopic systems with experimentally realistic
two-body interactions, how to design a Hamiltonian that realizes a desired
topological phase? Here we solve this problem on a platform motivated by
Rydberg atoms, where elementary two-level systems couple via simple blockade
interactions. Within this framework, we construct Hamiltonians that realize
topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models. We
analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state, and
present efficient schemes to prepare these states. We also introduce protocols
for the controlled adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their
non-abelian statistics. Our construction is generic and applies to quantum
doubles $\mathcal{D}(G)$ for arbitrary finite groups $G$. We illustrate
braiding for the simplest non-abelian quantum double $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了直接沉积法在量子光子网络领域中的应用，为未来的量子芯片设计提供了技术基础。

Abstract: Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright
single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor
quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while
rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer
exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these
systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to
lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate
low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films
directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an
arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of
epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface
roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature
oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough,
polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.
Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the
orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic
photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical
activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps
preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable
for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials
platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with
semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum
photonic chips.

TL;DR: We propose a new method for electron nuclear dynamics analysis by borrowing concepts from decoherence theory and adapt them to systems with strong electron-nucleus interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum dynamics in coupled systems is important for accurate simulations.

Method: We use the concept of pointer and preferred states from decoherence theory and apply it to electron-nucleus interaction systems. We also improve on mixed quantum classical methods by understanding their foundation in terms of decoherence.

Result: We develop a new method that better explains the success of certain mixed quantum-classical methods and provides a systematic improvement pathway for them.

Conclusion: A better foundation for methods used in quantum dynamics simulations will lead to better simulations in the future.

Abstract: Beyond the adiabatic regime, our understanding of quantum dynamics in coupled
systems remains limited, and the choice of representation continues to obscure
physical interpretation and simulation accuracy. Here we propose a natural and
efficient basis for electron nuclear dynamics by drawing on the concepts of
pointer and preferred states from decoherence theory, adapted to systems where
electrons and nuclei interact strongly. Within this framework, we show that 1)
the independent dynamics exploited by mixed quantum classical (MQC) methods is
best understood as a manifestation of entanglement viewed in a preferred basis,
rather than a consequence of decoherence, and 2) the adiabatic Born Oppenheimer
states satisfy the conditions of an approximate preferred basis. This
perspective reconciles widely used approximations with a more fundamental
structure of the theory and provides a systematic route to more reliable MQC
strategies. In effect, we revisit MQC methods through the lens of preferred
states, clarifying when they succeed and how they can be improved.

TL;DR: A method to control dissipation in open quantum systems to realize both the quantum Mpemba effect and its opposite, offering a versatile tool for quantum control and accelerated relaxation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling the Mpemba effect in quantum systems has implications for quantum information processing and thermodynamics, particularly in understanding non-equilibrium dynamics and potential applications in quantum control and optimization.

Method: The method involves applying a temporary bond-dissipation quench to selectively suppress or enhance slow relaxation modes, reshaping the relaxation pathways irrespective of the system or initial state.

Result: This approach successfully demonstrates the method in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation, with outlined feasible cold-atom implementations, establishing dissipation control as a versatile tool for quantum applications.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for manipulating non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum thermodynamics and information processing.

Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a state farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than
one closer to it, is a striking phenomenon in both classical and quantum
systems. In open quantum systems, however, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME)
typically occurs only for specifically chosen initial states, which limits its
universality. Here we present a general and experimentally feasible strategy to
realize both QME and anti-QME. By applying a temporary bond-dissipation quench,
we selectively suppresses or enhances slow relaxation modes, thereby reshaping
relaxation pathways independently of both the system and the initial state. We
demonstrate this mechanism in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation,
and outline feasible cold-atom implementations. Our results establish
controllable dissipation as a versatile tool for quantum control, accelerated
relaxation, and efficient nonequilibrium protocols.

Motivation:  understanding and encoding topological invariants such as Chern and Euler classes has potential applications in quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method:  extends toric codes by introducing errors that encode obstruction classes.

Result:  novel topological quantum error-correcting codes are constructed that encode obstruction classes like Chern and Euler.

Conclusion:  provides a new framework for quantum error correction based on topological invariants.

Abstract: Topological quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) encode a variety of
topological invariants in their code space. A classic structure that has not
been encoded directly is that of obstruction classes of a fiber bundle, such as
the Chern or Euler class. Here, we construct and analyze extensions of toric
codes. We then analyze the topological structure of their errors and finally
construct a novel code using these errors to encode the obstruction class to a
fiber bundle. In so doing, we construct an encoding of characteristic classes
such as the Chern and Pontryagin class in topological QECC. An example of the
Euler class of $S^2$ is constructed explicitly.

Abstract: Accurately determining ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems
remains one of the major challenges of quantum simulation. In this work, we
present a protocol for estimating the ground-state energy using only global
time evolution under a target Hamiltonian. This avoids the need for controlled
operations that are typically required in conventional quantum phase estimation
and extends the algorithm applicability to analog simulators. Our method
extracts energy differences from measurements of the Loschmidt echo over an
initial ground-state approximation, combines them with direct energy
measurements, and solves a set of equations to infer the individual
eigenenergies. We benchmark this protocol on free-fermion systems, showing
orders-of-magnitude precision gains over direct energy measurements on the
initial state, with accuracy improving rapidly with initial-state fidelity and
persisting for hundreds of modes. We further demonstrate applicability to the
2D Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models and show that the approach extends naturally
to other observables such as order parameters. Finally, we analyze the effect
of experimental imperfections and propose error-mitigation strategies. These
results establish a practical route to compute physically relevant quantities
with high precision using globally controlled quantum simulators.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce an exact expression for the response of a
semi-classical two-level quantum system subject to arbitrary periodic driving.
Determining the transition probabilities of a two-level system driven by an
arbitrary periodic waveform necessitates numerical calculations through methods
such as Floquet theory, requiring the truncation of an infinite matrix.
However, such truncation can lead to a loss of significant interference
information, hindering quantum sensors or introducing artifacts in quantum
control. To alleviate this issue, we use the $\star$-resolvent formalism with
the path-sum theorem to determine the exact series solution to Schr\"odinger's
equation, therefore providing the exact transition probability. The resulting
series solution is generated from a compact kernel expression containing all of
the information of the periodic drive and then expanded in a non-harmonic
Fourier series basis given by the divided difference of complex exponentials
with coefficients corresponding to products of generalized Bessel functions.
The present method provides an analytical formulation for quantum sensors and
control applications.

*Mauricio Gutiérrez,Chiranjib Mukhopadhyay,Victor Montenegro,Abolfazl Bayat*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Optimal quantum-enhanced precision can be achieved in multi-parameter sensing using GHZ probes, but only when quantum error correction is applied. GHZ-based sensing provides super-resolution scaling even with noise, by using multiple probes. This allows for robust and scalable quantum metrology.

motivation: Quantum sensing offers significant advantages in precision measurements, and scaling these advantages to multi-parameter scenarios is crucial for practical applications.

method: The approach involves using GHZ probes with quantum error correction techniques to shield extra parameters from interfering with the measurements. This enables the protocol to achieve optimal precision by treating most parameters as noise that can be corrected.

result: The protocol successfully demonstrates that multi-parameter GHZ sensing can reach Heisenberg scaling in precision, even in the presence of noise, by using multiple probes. This is proven through numerical simulations and Bayesian estimation.

conclusion: GHZ-based quantum sensing can be effectively extended to multi-parameter scenarios, providing a robust and scalable method for quantum metrology despite the presence of noise and uncertainties.

conclusion: GHZ-based quantum sensing can be effectively extended to multi-parameter scenarios, providing a robust and scalable method for quantum metrology despite the presence of noise and uncertainties.

Method: The paper proposes a protocol that uses GHZ probes with quantum error correction techniques to shield multiple unknown parameters, achieving optimal precision in multi-parameter sensing. By treating all but one unknown parameter as noise, they can employ quantum error correction to maintain precision across the entire parameter range. For each GHZ probe, they require one shielded ancilla qubit, allowing them to extract optimal precision for any number of probes. This approach ensures that the measurements remain separable and fixed, simplifying the experimental implementation. For a single GHZ probe, the precision is limited by shot noise but improves through the addition of complementary probes, leading to Heisenberg scaling. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using Bayesian estimation, showing that optimal precision is achievable across the entire parameter space despite the presence of noise.

Result: The paper demonstrates that multi-parameter GHZ sensing can achieve Heisenberg scaling in precision through the use of quantum error correction techniques. Specifically, by employing one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, the protocol achieves optimal precision for any number of probes, with the ability to improve scaling by using multiple complementary GHZ probes. Numerical simulations and Bayesian estimation confirm the effectiveness of the protocol, showing that it maintains precision even in the presence of noise and uncertainties. For a single GHZ probe, the precision is limited by shot noise but can be enhanced through the use of multiple probes, achieving Heisenberg scaling. This demonstrates that GHZ-based sensing is scalable and robust, even in practical scenarios with noise.

Conclusion: GHZ-based quantum sensing can be effectively extended to multi-parameter scenarios, providing a robust and scalable method for achieving optimal precision across all unknown parameter values. By incorporating quantum error correction techniques to shield against extraneous parameters or noise, the protocol demonstrates that precision can be maintained even in the presence of noise and uncertainties. For a single GHZ probe, the precision is limited by shot noise but can be improved through the addition of multiple complementary probes, achieving Heisenberg scaling. This approach maintains the simplicity of the measurement process by keeping the measurements separable and fixed, making it practical for real-world applications. The protocol's effectiveness is confirmed through Bayesian estimation, showing its scalability and robustness against noise in multi-parameter quantum metrology.

Abstract: For single-parameter sensing, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) probes
achieve optimal quantum-enhanced precision across the unknown parameter range,
solely relying on parameter-independent separable measurement strategies for
all values of the unknown parameter. However, in the multiparameter setting, a
single GHZ probe not only fails to achieve quantum advantage but also the
corresponding optimal measurement becomes complex and dependent on the unknown
parameters. Here, we provide a recipe for multiparameter sensing with GHZ
probes using quantum error correction techniques by treating all but one
unknown parameters as noise, whose effects can be corrected. This strategy
restores the core advantage of single parameter GHZ-based quantum sensing,
namely reaching optimally quantum-enhanced precision for all unknown parameter
values while keeping the measurements separable and fixed. Specifically, given
one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, our protocol extracts optimal
possible precision for any probe size. While this optimal precision is
shot-noise limited for a single GHZ probe, we recover the Heisenberg scaling
through use of multiple complementary GHZ probes. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the protocol with Bayesian estimation.

Abstract: The principle that heat spontaneously flows from higher temperature to lower
temperature is a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, often assumed to be
independent of the sequence of interactions. While this holds true for
macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of
interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an
anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder
entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design
a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves
refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum
Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which
provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.

Abstract: Quantum state discrimination, alongside its other applications, has recently
found use as a tool for witnessing generalised contextuality. In this article,
we derive noncontextuality inequalities for both conclusive and inconclusive
outcomes across various guessing strategies. For minimum- error discrimination,
the advantage is in terms of the confidences of individual outcomes, while for
unambiguous state discrimination, it is in terms of the average guessing
probability. For maximum- confidence discrimination, we show that contextual
advantages occur not only for the confidence but also their average, the
guessing probability, as well as the inconclusive outcome rate. Our results
unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and
figures of merit. We envisage that various quantum information applications
based on state discrimination may offer advantages over non-contextual
theories.

Abstract: Pure dephasing is the dominant leak mechanism in photonic cat qubits because
its phase errors disrupt the parity protection, rendering the qubit vulnerable
to energy relaxation. In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing
mechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces
\textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and
odd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the
dynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby
transforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for
probing non-Hermitian physics. Within this platform, we demonstrate the
possibility to control the parity-time symmetry phase transition in a single
cat qubit by adjusting its amplitude. Moreover, we couple two cat qubits to
realize an entanglement phase transition induced by the exceptional point. Our
work constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator, overturning the
conventional paradigm that treats dephasing as harmful noise.

Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a
new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this
work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as
a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven
criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective
measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and
decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits,
MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed
states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay
gives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical
simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the
two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a
diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables
efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body
numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase
transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional Hamiltonians. Our results
highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics
and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: By comparing Schr\"odinger's cat with its classical counterpart, I show that
a quantum superposition should be understood as an expectation over possible
eigenstates weighted by wave-like probabilities. Upon the occurrence of a
certain event, the quantum system is randomly realized into one of the possible
eigenstates due to its intrinsic stochasticity. While the randomness of a
single realization cannot be controlled or predicted, the overall distribution
can be regulated via experimental setup and converges as the number of events
increases. A measurement is indeed an activity employing a certain event to
convert a quantum effect into a macroscopic outcome. Consequently, the puzzling
concepts of wavefunction collapse, many worlds, and decoherence become
unnecessary for understanding quantum superposition. This
expectation-realization interpretation, which integrates probability theory
with wave mechanics, can also be extended to quantum pathways. Moreover, it
reframes tests of Bell's inequalities as validating the wave-like probability
nature of quantum mechanics, with no need to invoke the mysterious notions of
quantum non-locality and "spooky action at a distance".

Abstract: In this work, we experimentally study the fluorescence decay of Acridine
Orange at late times, in order to test whether a late-time power-law behaviour
emerges, a feature expected to be very small but consistent with quantum
mechanical and quantum field theoretical predictions. Using two distinct photon
detectors, we find that the data are well described by a sum of two exponential
functions with lifetimes $\tau_1 = 1.7331 \pm 0.001$ ns and $\tau_2 = 5.948 \pm
0.012$ ns, in agreement with values reported in the literature. While no
deviation from the exponential decay law is observed, this study serves as a
reliable test for the experimental setup and enables a precise determination of
the sample lifetimes.

Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators
for quantum field theory. We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression
in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any
lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of
matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law
directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product
states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to
construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond
quantum cellular automata.

*Amir Yona,Yaron Oz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol using charge teleportation over many-body ground states is developed. The protocol is shown to be robust and compatible with near-term quantum platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum key distribution is a critical component for secure quantum communication. Developing practical QKD schemes with low qubit and energy requirements is essential for near-term quantum networks. This work introduces a novel approach based on charge teleportation, which demonstrates robustness against realistic noise.

Method: The protocol is constructed using Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on entangled many-body ground states. Alice's choice affects a local charge shift at Bob, encoding the key bit. The charge signal is bit-symmetric and more resilient to noise compared to energy teleportation.

Result: The protocol is successfully instantiated on transverse-field Ising models, both star-coupled and one-dimensional chains. For two qubits, exact results are obtained, and larger systems are analyzed using exact diagonalization and circuit simulations. The protocol shows resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, confirming its practicality.

Conclusion: Charge teleportation-based QKD provides a promising, low-rate primitive suitable for near-term quantum platforms, offering robustness and simplicity under realistic conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge
teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an
entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a
local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to
energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a
single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model
imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models,
star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two
qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization,
circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify
resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes
where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results
position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible
with near-term platforms.

*Ahmad Salmanogli,Hesam Zandi*

TL;DR: A scalable superconducting quantum chip architecture is developed that simultaneously preserves entanglement and readout fidelity by optimizing the trade-off between qubit coupling for entanglement and minimizing crosstalk for fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the key challenge in scalable quantum hardware development, which is balancing qubit coupling for entanglement with crosstalk limiting fidelity.

Method: The proposed method involves developing a hybrid multi-qubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits. The interior qubits and a tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The system dynamics are characterized by numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian and the Lindblad master equation.

Result: The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating an avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions.

Conclusion: The results confirm that entanglement strength and measurement fidelity can be co-optimized within a single reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to
simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of
the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In
conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances
entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced
measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit
configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and
exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of
distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an
entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime
under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be
dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit
and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant
coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among
interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through
interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside
the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing
evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by
creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity
around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that
entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single,
reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward
high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Twisted cylindrical tubes are important model systems for nanostructures,
heterostructures, and curved quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the
quantum behavior of an electron confined to a twisted cylindrical surface. By
first calculating the strain tensor to obtain the induced surface metric, we
employ da Costa's formalism to derive the geometry-induced quantum potential.
This potential modifies the Schr\"odinger equation even in the absence of
external forces, allowing us to determine the bound states and energy
eigenvalues. This was made in the linear and non-linear torsion regime.
Furthermore, we analyze two distinct scattering problems: (i) scattering within
an infinite cylinder containing a twisted section, and (ii) scattering of a
free particle incident upon a finite twisted cylinder. Our goal is to
understand how geometry and strain influence the properties of analogous
untwisted systems. It turns out that both the linear and non-linear twists
yield to a geometric phase into the wave function, while the da Costa potential
is kept unchanged. Consequently, the system supports bound states whose energie
spectrum is twist independent. For both scattering problems, we find that the
transmission probability is insensitive to torsion, whereas it is significantly
affected by the particle angular momentum and the cylinder's radius, exhibiting
distinct oscillatory behavior. These findings suggest relevant implications for
engineering quantum devices based on materials with controlled curvature and
twist.

*Xuan Zhang,XIao-le Li,Jingjing Niu,Tongxing Yan,Yuanzhen Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Geometric quantum gates exhibit theoretical resilience to control errors, but practical robustness is inconsistent. This paper presents a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) with enhanced design flexibility, demonstrating high-fidelity single-qubit gates resistant to Rabi amplitude errors with superior resilience compared to conventional gates. The paper also explores two-qubit NGQGs under parametric driving, revealing limitations in performance, emphasizing the importance of phase compensation and waveform calibration. The framework is simple and general, applicable across diverse quantum platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving robust and reliable quantum gates is crucial for practical quantum computing, as errors and noise in quantum systems can degrade the performance of quantum algorithms. This paper addresses the challenge by proposing a framework for designing robust nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates.

Method: The paper proposes a framework for designing nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) that incorporates auxiliary constraints to suppress dynamical contamination and achieves super-robust performance. The framework is applied to superconducting transmon qubits, demonstrating high-fidelity single-qubit gates resistant to Rabi amplitude errors. Two-qubit gates are also explored under parametric driving, and limitations in their performance are identified.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves the robustness of geometric quantum gates. Single-qubit gates are shown to have an infidelity scaling as 𝒪(ϵ⁴), compared to the 𝒪(ϵ²) scaling of conventional dynamical gates. In two-qubit gates, limitations in performance related to phase compensation and waveform calibration are identified, but the framework's simplicity and generality make it applicable across diverse quantum platforms.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates can be made highly robust and reliable, with the proposed framework providing a promising direction for practical quantum computing. The identification of limitations in two-qubit gates highlights the need for further research in phase compensation and waveform calibration, but the framework's effectiveness is validated by its successful application to superconducting transmon qubits.

Abstract: While geometric quantum gates are often theorized to possess intrinsic
resilience to control errors by exploiting the global properties of evolution
paths, this promise has not consistently translated into practical robustness.
We present a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates
(NGQGs) that incorporates additional auxiliary constraints to suppress
dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance. Within this
framework, we also design NGQGs using noncyclic paths, offering enhanced design
flexibility. Implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, our scheme
realizes high-fidelity single-qubit gates that are robust against Rabi
amplitude error $\epsilon$, with infidelity scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$
behavior of conventional dynamical gates. We further analyze two-qubit NGQGs
under parametric driving. Our results identify subtle limitations that
compromise performance in two-qubit scenarios, underscoring the importance of
phase compensation and waveform calibration. The demonstrated simplicity and
generality of our super-robust NGQG scheme make it applicable across diverse
quantum platforms.

Abstract: Local quantum coherence in a two-level system (TLS) is typically generated
via time-dependent driving. However, it can also emerge autonomously from
symmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment
at a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting
atoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating
the autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this
gap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS
coupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the
whole system being in thermal equilibrium. We show that the local coherence not
only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures of the environment
compared to the case of no inter-source interactions. The temperature
dependence of the coherence bears signatures of a quantum phase transition, and
our analytical results suggest strategies for its optimization. Our findings
reveal generic properties of the autonomously generated quantum coherence and
point to viable routes for observing the coherence at nonzero temperatures.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在几何量子机器学习中，随着对称性的增加，量子门电路的可扩展性会减小，但其纠缠能力会增强。因此，选择足够可扩展且计算效率高的量子态架构时，应考虑对称性的增加及其对门电路复杂度的影响。

Conclusion: 这些结果帮助我们从可扩展性和计算效率角度，为几何量子机器学习应用场景中量子态架构的模式选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Leveraging data symmetries has been a key driver of performance gains in
geometric deep learning and geometric and equivariant quantum machine learning.
While symmetrization appears to be a promising method, its practical overhead,
such as additional gates, reduced expressibility, and other factors, is not
well understood in quantum machine learning. In this work, we develop an
automated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine
learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning
task. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of
the subgroup it admits. Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not
been extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries
defined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to
these varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of
metrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying
amounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference
between the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts
depth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third
class of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results
demonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that
increased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases,
increased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select
sufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for
geometric quantum machine learning applications.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，如何在分布式系统中实现高效的通信和协同计算变得 increasingly重要。特别是在量子处理器的规模扩大和技术复杂性增加的情况下，优化通信复杂度已成为量子计算的核心挑战之一。

Conclusion: 该研究为分布式量子处理器中的单元ary实现提供了新的通信复杂度度量方法，并通过理论分析和实例计算，明确了不同处理器配置和单元ary类别在通信复杂度上的差异。这些结论为分布式量子计算的实践和未来研究提供了重要指导。

Abstract: We study space-bounded communication complexity for unitary implementation in
distributed quantum processors, where we restrict the number of qubits per
processor to ensure practical relevance and technical non-triviality. We model
distributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal
two-qubit gates, defining the communication complexity of a unitary as the
minimum number of such nonlocal gates required for its realization.
  Our contributions are twofold. First, for general $n$-qubit unitaries, we
improve upon the trivial $O(4^n)$ communication bound. Considering $k$
pairwise-connected processors (each with $n/k$ data qubits and $m$ ancillas),
we prove the communication complexity satisfies $O\left(\max\{4^{(1-1/k)n - m},
n\}\right)$--for example, $O(2^n)$ when $m=0$ and $k=2$--and establish the
tightness of this upper bound. We further extend the analysis to approximation
models and general network topologies. Second, for special unitaries, we show
that both the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Clifford circuits admit
linear upper bounds on communication complexity in the exact model,
outperforming the trivial quadratic bounds applicable to these cases. In the
approximation model, QFT's communication complexity reduces drastically from
linear to logarithmic, while Clifford circuits retain a linear lower bound.
These results offer fundamental insights for optimizing communication in
distributed quantum unitary implementation, advancing the feasibility of
large-scale distributed quantum computing (DQC) systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This article presents the first complete application of a quantum
time-marching algorithm for simulating multidimensional linear transport
phenomena with arbitrary boundaries, whereby the success probabilities are
problem intrinsic. The method adapts the linear combination of unitaries
algorithm to block encode the diffusive dynamics, while arbitrary boundary
conditions are enforced by the method of images only at the cost of one
additional qubit per spatial dimension. As an alternative to the non-periodic
reflection, the direct encoding of Neumann conditions by the unitary
decomposition of the discrete time-marching operator is proposed. All presented
algorithms indicate optimal success probabilities while maintaining linear time
complexity, thereby securing the practical applicability of the quantum
algorithm on fault-tolerant quantum computers. The proposed time-marching
method is demonstrated through state-vector simulations of the heat equation in
combination with Neumann, Dirichlet, and mixed boundary conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Preserving quantum correlations such as Bell nonlocality in noisy
environments remains a fundamental challenge for quantum technologies. We
introduce the Random Access Bell Game (RABG), a task where an entangled
particle propagates through a sequence of identical noisy blocks, and the
ability to violate a Bell inequality is tested at a randomly chosen point
(access node). We consider a scenario where each noisy block is composed of two
complete erasure channels, an extreme entanglement-breaking channel with
vanishing quantum and classical capacities. We investigate the performance of
the Random Access Bell Game in this configuration and attempt to mitigate the
effect of noise by coherently controlling the order of each channel in the
noise using the quantum {\tt SWITCH}. However, the quantum {\tt SWITCH} in its
canonical setup with a coherent state in the control fails to provide any
advantage in the Random Access Bell Game. Our main contribution is a protocol
that leverages initial entanglement between the target and control of the
quantum {\tt SWITCH} and employs sequential, unsharp measurements on the
control system, showing that it is possible to guarantee a Bell violation after
an arbitrarily large number of channel applications. Furthermore, our protocol
allows for a near-maximal (Tsirelson bound) Bell violation to be achieved at
any desired round, while still ensuring violations in all preceding rounds. We
prove that this advantage is specific to generalized
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, as the protocol fails for W-class
states, thus providing an operational way to distinguish between these two
fundamental classes of multipartite entanglement.

Abstract: We discuss the (re-)construction of quasiprobability representations from

Abstract: We investigate the implementation of photonic cluster state generation
protocols using quantum metasurfaces comprising sub-wavelength atomic arrays
which enables quantum-controlled reflectivity. These cluster states are
generated using fundamental quantum logic gates and enable wide-ranging
applications in quantum computation and communication. In the past few years,
certain protocols have been developed, but their physical realizations induces
natural losses on the system mainly originated from coupling the photonic
structures, setting a limit on the efficiency and maximal qubit number. In this
paper, we examine a physical implementation of two specific protocols for
generating distinct cluster states: a two-dimensional cluster state and a tree
cluster state. Our approach leverages the unique properties of a quantum
metasurface and its free space settings to implement two-qubit quantum-logic
gates, namely CNOT, CZ, and E gates, with practical fidelities exceeding 0.9,
and potential speed-up due to parallelism. In addition, we analyze these
protocols fidelities for practical conditions of potential implementation
experiments, such as thermal fluctuation of trapped atoms.

Abstract: We study phase-synchronization in a driven two-level system coupled to a
non-Markovian bosonic reservoir. The dynamics is described by treating the
system-bath coupling and the coherent drive without invoking the rotating-wave
approximation, and simulated using the numerically exact hierarchical equations
of motion. We observe that a robust phase-locking develops and that the
corresponding synchronization measure rapidly acquires a finite value when the
system is tuned to what we identify as a resonant-ratio condition, namely when
the ratio between the drive amplitude and its frequency coincides with a zero
of the Bessel function $J_0$. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon by
means of a static approximation derived from a Fourier analysis of the
periodically driven Hamiltonian.

Result: Gave high-fidelity gates (98%-99%) and demonstrated resilience to fluctuations; successfully simulated Grover's algorithm for 2- to 4-qubit systems with high success probability.

Conclusion: This approach provides a feasible and scalable path for fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.

Abstract: Adiabatic geometric phase gates offer enhanced robustness against
fluctuations compared to con- ventional Rydberg blockade-based phase gates that
rely on dynamical phase accumulation. We theoretically demonstrate two- and
multi-qubit phase gates in a neutral atom architecture, relying on a double
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence that imprints
a controllable geometric phase on the qubit systems. The system is designed in
such a way that every atom is individually addressable, and moreover, no extra
laser is required to be applied on the target atom while scaling up the system
from two- to multi-qubit quantum gates. The gate fidelity has been numerically
analyzed by changing the gate operation time, and we find that 98% to 99%
fidelity can be achieved for gate time $\simeq$ 0.6 $\mu$s. We perform a
systematic error analysis, which re- veals that our proposed gates can exhibit
strong resilience against fluctuations in Rabi frequencies, finite blockade
strength, and atomic position variations. These results establish our approach
as a physically feasible and scalable pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum
computation with neutral atoms. We simulate Grover's search algorithm for two-,
three-, and four-qubit systems with high success probability and thereby
demonstrate the utility and scalability of our proposed gates for quantum
computation.

Abstract: Protocols for quantum measurement are an essential part of quantum computing.
Measurements are no longer confined to the final step of computation but are
increasingly embedded within quantum circuits as integral components of
noise-resilient algorithms. However, each observable typically requires a
distinct measurement basis, often demanding a different circuit configuration.
As the number of such configurations typically grows with the number of qubits,
different measurement configurations constitute a major bottleneck. Focusing on
electronic structure calculations in crystalline systems, we propose a
measurement protocol that maximally reduces the number of measurement settings
to just three, independent of the number of qubits. This makes it one of the
few known protocols that do not scale with qubit number. In particular, we
derive the measurement protocol from the symmetries of tight-binding (TB)
Hamiltonians and implement it within the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD)
algorithm. We demonstrate its performance on two systems, namely a
two-dimensional CuO$_2$ square lattice (3 qubits) and bilayer graphene (4
qubits). The protocol can be generalized to more complex many-body Hamiltonians
with high symmetry, providing a potential path toward future demonstrations of
quantum advantage.

TL;DR: QuEL-1 SE is a stable multichannel qubit controller with excellent long-term performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stable qubit controllers are essential for reliable quantum operations and scalable quantum computing.

Method: The system incorporates active thermal stabilization; multi-channel monitoring over 24h using a common ADC; assessment of amplitude and phase stability; evaluation of quantum gate fidelity under estimated errors.

Result: Amplitude deviations: 0.15% mean, 0.09%-0.22% std; Phase deviations: 0.39° mean, 0.35-0.44° std; Quantum gate fidelity: 2e-6 (amplitude), 2e-5 (phase), better than surface code thresholds.

Conclusion: Stable amplitude and phase control enable reliable long-duration quantum operations, making QuEL-1 SE a valuable platform for qubit control.

Abstract: We present the design and performance of QuEL-1 SE, which is a multichannel
qubit controller developed for superconducting qubits. The system incorporates
the active thermal stabilization of critical analog integrated circuits, such
as phase-locked loops, amplifiers, and mixers, to suppress the long-term
amplitude and phase drift. To evaluate the amplitude and phase stability, we
simultaneously monitor 15 microwave output channels over 24 h using a common
analog-to-digital converter. Across the channels, the normalized amplitude
exhibits standard deviations of 0.09\%--0.22\% (mean: 0.15\%), and the phase
deviations are 0.35$^\circ$--0.44$^\circ$ (mean: 0.39$^\circ$). We further
assess the impact of these deviations on quantum gate operations by estimating
the average fidelity of an $X_{\pi/2}$ gate under the coherent errors
corresponding to the deviations. The resulting gate infidelities are $2\times
10^{-6}$ for amplitude errors and $2\times 10^{-5}$ for phase errors, which are
significantly lower than typical fault-tolerance thresholds such as those of
the surface code. These results demonstrate that the amplitude and phase
stability of QuEL-1 SE enables reliable long-duration quantum operations, thus
highlighting its utility as a scalable control platform for superconducting and
other qubit modalities.

*Santanu Majhi,Debajyoti Bera*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum secret-sharing framework using search algorithms, optimized detection, and designed for public, non-multi-round use. Reveals a theoretical security limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strengthening quantum cryptography's resistance against eavesdropping is imperative.

Method: Analyzed and enhanced a 2003 quantum secret sharing protocol.

Result: Enhanced scheme reduces eavesdropping detection; theoretical sec limit found.

Conclusion:  substance within quantum cryptography, no fully secure framework without restrictions.

Abstract: Secret-sharing schemes allow a dealer to split a secret into multiple
"shares" and distribute them individually among many parties while mandating
certain constraints on its reconstruction. Such protocols are usually executed
over a secure communication channel since an eavesdropper, after intercepting
all the shares, is expected to be able to reconstruct the secret. Leveraging
the unique properties of quantum channels, several quantum protocols have been
designed for secret sharing. However, almost all of them detect the presence of
an eavesdropper by statistical analysis of the outcome of multiple rounds, or
simply require a secure channel of communication.
  We present a complete characterisation of the correctness and security
properties of a quantum-search based secret-sharing framework proposed by Hsu
(2003). The scheme was designed to work over public channels without requiring
multiple rounds to detect eavesdropping. Our characterisation allowed us to
improve the original protocol to be more resistant towards eavesdropping.
However, we prove that complete security against an eavesdropper is not
possible in this framework.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum data hiding stores classical information in bipartite quantum states
that are, in principle, perfectly distinguishable, yet remain almost
indistinguishable without access to a quantum communication channel. Here, we
investigate whether this limitation can be overcome when the communicating
parties are assisted by additional quantum resources. We develop a general
framework for state discrimination that unifies catalytic and memory-assisted
local discrimination protocols and analyze their power to reveal hidden
information. We prove that when the hiding states are separable, neither
entangled catalysts nor quantum memory can increase the optimal discrimination
probability, establishing the robustness of separable data-hiding schemes. In
contrast, for some entangled states, a reusable quantum memory turns locally
indistinguishable states into ones that can be discriminated almost perfectly.
Our results delineate the fundamental limits of catalytic and memory-assisted
state discrimination and identify separable encodings as a robust strategy for
quantum data hiding.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The notions of privacy tests and $k$-extendible states have both been
instrumental in quantum information theory, particularly in understanding the
limits of secure communication. In this paper, we determine the maximum
probability with which an arbitrary $k$-extendible state can pass a privacy
test, and we prove that it is equal to the maximum fidelity between an
arbitrary $k$-extendible state and the standard maximally entangled state. Our
findings, coupled with the resource theory of $k$-unextendibility, lead to an
efficiently computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable key of
a bipartite state, and we prove that it is equal to the best-known efficiently
computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable entanglement. We
also establish efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot,
forward-assisted private capacity of channels. Extending our formalism to the
independent and identically distributed setting, we obtain single-letter
efficiently computable bounds on the $n$-shot, one-way distillable key of a
state and the $n$-shot, forward-assisted private capacity of a channel. For
some key examples of interest, our bounds are significantly tighter than other
known efficiently computable bounds.

Conclusion: 该方法为验证任意维 POVM 的非可模拟性提供了一种通用而有效的技术，扩展了其在量子信息处理中的应用范围。

Abstract: Determining the conditions under which positive operator-valued measures
(POVMs), the most general class of quantum measurements, outperform projective
measurements remains a challenging and largely unresolved problem. Of
particular interest are projectively simulable POVMs, which can be realized
through probabilistic mixtures of projective measurements, and therefore offer
no advantage over projective schemes. Characterizing the boundary between
simulable and non-simulable POVMs is, however, a difficult task, and existing
tools either fail to scale efficiently, provide limited experimental
feasibility or work only for specific POVMs. Here, we introduce and demonstrate
a general method to certify non-simulability of a POVM by introducing a
hierarchy of semidefinite programs. It provides upper bounds on the
non-simulability measure of critical visibility of arbitrary POVMs which are
tight in many cases and outperform previously known criteria. We experimentally
certify the non-simulability of two- and three-dimensional POVMs using a
trapped-ion qudit quantum processor by constructing non-simulability witnesses
and introduce a modification of our framework that makes them robust against
state preparation errors. Finally, we extend our results to the setting where
an additional ancilla system is available.

Conclusion: 该混合架构为高效量子网络提供了新途径。

Abstract: Different quantum systems possess different favorable qualities. On the one
hand, ensemble-based quantum memories are suited for fast multiplexed
long-range entanglement generation. On the other hand, single-atomic systems
provide access to gates for processing of information. Both of those can
provide advantages for high-rate entanglement generation within quantum
networks. We develop a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of these
properties by combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes comprised of spontaneous
parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on
rare-earth ion ensembles. To this end, we solve the central challenge of
matching the different bandwidths of photons emitted by those systems in an
initial entanglement-generation step. This enables the parallel execution of
multiple probabilistic tasks in the initial stage. We show that our approach
can lead to a significant speed-up for the fundamental task of creating ion-ion
entanglement over hundreds of kilometers in a quantum network.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational
hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the
low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical
MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum
optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution
scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This
scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and
improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit
depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and
projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms
its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum
enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization
algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of quantum computing is seeing growing interest in utilizing NISQ devices, but the lack of accessible tools complicates experimental work. QEF aims to fill this gap by providing a user-friendly framework for quantum algorithm studies, addressing the need for efficient and reproducible experimentation.

Method: QEF is designed as a framework that facilitates systematic and hypothesis-driven quantum algorithm research. It captures key quantum software and algorithm characteristics through a concise specification, enabling controlled parameter sweeps and efficient resource management. The framework emphasizes scalability and reproducibility, allowing for full hyper-parameter traceability and reducing experimental runtimes through parameter reuse.

Result: The framework offers a robust solution for optimizing and analyzing quantum algorithms, particularly suited for both current NISQ devices and future error-corrected systems. By standardizing experimental processes and enhancing scalability, QEF significantly lowers the barrier for empirical research in quantum computing.

Conclusion: QEF represents a valuable advancement in quantum algorithm experimentation, providing a flexible and scalable tool that supports efficient and reproducible research across various quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: Commercially available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices now
make small hybrid quantum-classical experiments practical, but many tools hide
configuration or demand ad-hoc scripting.
  We introduce the Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF): A lightweight framework
designed to support the systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum
algorithms. Unlike many existing approaches, QEF emphasises iterative,
exploratory analysis of evolving experimental strategies rather than exhaustive
empirical evaluation of fixed algorithms using predefined quality metrics. The
framework's design is informed by a comprehensive review of the literature,
identifying principal parameters and measurement practices currently reported
in the field.
  QEF captures all key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments
through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of
variants for controlled large-scale parameter sweeps. This design enables
rigorous and systematic evaluation, as well as precise reproducibility. Large
sweeps are automatically partitioned into asynchronous jobs across simulators
or cloud hardware, and ascertain full hyper-parameter traceability. QEF
supports parameter reuse to improve overall experiment runtimes, and collects
all metrics and metadata into a form that can be conveniently explored with
standard statistical and visualisation software.
  By combining reproducibility and scalability while avoiding the complexities
of full workflow engines, QEF seeks to lower the practical barriers to
empirical research on quantum algorithms, whether these are designed for
current NISQ devices or future error-corrected quantum systems.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the ability to resolve the pulse-by-pulse structure of squeezed states of light at telecom wavelengths while preserving their spectral multimode properties.

Conclusion: Wideband homodyne detectors capable of high-speed pulsed operation at telecom wavelengths have been developed, opening new possibilities for quantum information processing applications.

Abstract: Homodyne detection is a phase-sensitive measurement technique, essential for
the characterization of continuous-variable (CV)-encoded quantum states of
light. It is a key component to the implementation of CV quantum-information
protocols and benefits from operating, by design, at room temperature. However,
performing high-speed quantum information processing remains a major challenge,
as conventional homodyne detectors often fail to sustain pulsed operation at
high repetition rates due to electronic limitations. We present wideband
homodyne detectors operating at near-infrared (NIR) and telecom wavelengths,
with optimized performance at repetition rates up to 150 MHz. We demonstrate
their performance by resolving the pulse-by-pulse structure of squeezed states
of light at telecom wavelengths while preserving their spectral multimode

*Mikhail Guselnikov,Alexei D. Kiselev,Andrei Gaidash,George Miroshnichenko,Anton Kozubov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the detection of quantum interference effects such as Hong-Ou-Mandel bunching and antibunching through the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$, which is influenced by the parity properties of a spectral function. This parameter determines the two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}$. The paper proposes using modulated biphoton states to switch between bunching and antibunching states by adjusting the Schmidt number, which depends on a modulation parameter. The symmetry degree shows resonance peaks correlated with dips in the probability of antibunching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to explore methods for detecting quantum interference effects at the two-photon level, which has implications for quantum optics and quantum information processing.

Method: The authors analyze the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ by examining the parity properties of the spectral function $ar{
u}_{12}(
u)$. They derive that $D_S$ is primarily influenced by the even or odd components of this function. The method involves creating modulated biphoton states using spectral phase modulation, which is experimentally feasible through fine-tuning of path lengths at the sub-nanometer scale. They compute the Schmidt number as a function of the modulation parameter and identify its dependence on the probability of antibunching.

Result: The results demonstrate that by modulating the biphoton states, one can switch between Hong-Ou-Mandel bunching and antibunching. This is evidenced by the dependence of the Schmidt number on the modulation parameter, revealing a structure of narrow resonance peaks that align with the dips in the symmetry degree, indicating the occurrence of antibunching.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel approach to detect and manipulate quantum interference effects at the two-photon level, offering a promising method for applications in quantum optics and potentially in quantum information processing technologies. The method leverages the experimentally accessible modulated biphoton states to control the symmetry degree parameter, enabling the observation of bunching and antibunching regimes的有效性。通过实验可调制的双光子态，该研究展示了如何实现对称程度参数的有目的控制，从而观察到分立的相位和反相位 regimes，为量子光学中的新应用提供了基础。

Abstract: We investigate into experimentally detectable effects such as the
Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching. These regimes can be
characterized using the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ that enters the
two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}=(1-D_S)/2$. In the case of HOM
bunching (antibunching), $D_S$ is positive (negative). Though the symmetry
degree can generally be expressed in terms of the difference between the
contributions coming from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the biphoton
joint spectral amplitude (JSA), $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$, for a certain
physically realizable class of the JSA, where $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ is
proportional to the product of amplitudes
$\varphi_1(\omega_1)\varphi_2(\omega_2)$ multiplied by a Gaussian shaped
entangling factor, we find the sign of $D_S$ is primarily governed by the
parity properties of the spectral function,
$\varphi_{12}(\omega)=\varphi_1(\omega)\varphi_2^*(\omega)$. It is the even
(odd) part of $\varphi_{12}=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}+\varphi_{12}^{(-)}$ that meets
the parity condition
$\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\omega-\Omega)=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\Omega-\omega)$
($\varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\omega-\Omega)=- \varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\Omega-\omega)$) to
yield the positive (negative) contribution, $D_S^{(+)}$ ($-D_S^{(-)}$), to the
symmetry degree parameter: $D_S=D_S^{(+)}-D_S^{(-)}$. We have shown that
switching between the bunching and antibunching regimes can be realized using
the experimentally accessible family of modulated biphoton states produced
using the spectral phase modulation fine-tuned via the sub-nanometer scale
variation of the path length. For this class of modulated states, the Schmidt
number has been computed as a function of the modulation parameter. This
dependence reveals the structure of narrow resonance peaks strongly correlated
with the corresponding narrow dips of the symmetry degree where the HOM
antibunching occurs.

Result: 在多种量子指令集架构和硬件拓扑下，Canopus将路由开销减少了15%-35%。

Conclusion: 这就是为什么我们需要这样的优化框架。

Abstract: Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term
and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically
impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or
duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely
on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-$ \mathrm{CX} $-unrolled SWAP
insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported
by physical devices.
  Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of
diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard
$\mathrm{CX}$-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as
$\mathrm{\sqrt{iSWAP}}$ and $\mathrm{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates offer superior circuit
synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However,
systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are
lacking.
  To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing
framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical
representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform
deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit
canonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost
for more intelligent $ \mathrm{SWAP} $ insertion during the routing stage. We
also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the
canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based
optimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing
overhead by 15\%-35\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different
ISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for
co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum cryptography is a rapidly-developing area which leverages quantum
information to accomplish classically-impossible tasks. In many of these
protocols, quantum states are used as long-term cryptographic keys. Typically,
this is to ensure the keys cannot be copied by an adversary, owing to the
quantum no-cloning theorem. Unfortunately, due to quantum state's tendency to
decohere, persistent quantum memory will likely be one of the most challenging
resources for quantum computers. As such, it will be important to minimize
persistent memory in quantum protocols.
  In this work, we consider the case of one-shot signatures (OSS), and more
general quantum signing tokens. These are important unclonable primitives,
where quantum signing keys allow for signing a single message but not two.
Naturally, these quantum signing keys would require storage in long-term
quantum memory. Very recently, the first OSS was constructed in a classical
oracle model and also in the standard model, but we observe that the quantum
memory required for these protocols is quite large. In this work, we
significantly decrease the quantum secret key size, in some cases achieving
asymptotically optimal size. To do so, we develop novel techniques for proving
the security of cryptosystems using coset states, which are one of the main
tools used in unclonable cryptography.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to enhance the performance and scalability of quantum LDPC codes, which are crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: The method involves performing 2x2 cross-swap operations followed by local repairs using integer linear programming to maintain orthogonality.

Result: The result is the development of a novel, randomized construction for quantum LDPC codes that is scalable to large code sizes.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical and efficient way to improve the performance of quantum error correction codes.

Abstract: We propose a method for modifying orthogonal sparse matrix pairs used in CSS
codes while preserving their matrix row and column weight distributions, which
play a crucial role in determining the performance of belief-propagation
decoding. Unlike simple row or column permutations that merely reorder existing
elements, the proposed local modification introduces genuine structural
randomness through small $2\times2$ cross-swap operations followed by
integer-linear-program-based local repairs that restore orthogonality. By
applying this procedure repeatedly in a random manner, ensembles of randomized
quantum LDPC codes can be constructed. The computational complexity of each
repair depends only on the maximum row and column weights and is independent of
the overall matrix size, ensuring scalability to large code blocks.

Abstract: Interactions between quantum systems enable quantum gates, the building
blocks of quantum information processing. In photonics, direct photon-photon
interactions are too weak to be practically useful, so effective interactions
are engineered with linear optics and measurement. A central challenge is to
realize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain
spatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential
non-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in
both qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by
the AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared
entanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum
indistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent
superpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we
uncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum
teleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements.
Technically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical
resource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they
demonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and
techniques in physics.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于强压缩光物质特性的解析框架，并展示了 Whittaker-Shannon分解在光的压缩分析中的应用前景。

Abstract: The Whittaker-Shannon decomposition provides a temporally localized
description of squeezed light, making it applicable in the CW limit and leading
to a definition of squeezing strength based on the number of photon pairs at a
time. We show examples of its usefulness by calculating quadrature variance in
a homodyne detection scheme, coincidence detection probabilities in the
continuous-wave limit, and analyzing the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect for strongly
squeezed light. Quadrature uncertainty falls farther below the shot noise limit
when squeezing is strong, but effects due to correlations between photon pairs
are most significant with weak squeezing. Our analysis extends previous results
to more general scenarios, and we leverage the Whittaker-Shannon formalism to
interpret them based on the temporal properties of photon pairs.

Conclusion: 通过研究广义逐字符搜索问题的量子查询复杂度，研究者 解决了多个重要的开放性问题，为量子计算理论的发展提供了新的见解。

Abstract: In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum
Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in
\{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the
hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a
quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight
$O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound.
  We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a
subset $\cal{Q} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S =
b$ for an arbitrary $S \in \cal{Q}$ and $b \in \{-1,1\}^S$ of its choice, at
unit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\cal{Q}$ is any of the following
collections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full
set.
  All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using
symmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of
learning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization
program, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd
functions $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$
to the maximum (over $T \in \cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube
whose free variables are exactly $T$.'
  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal
version of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program
typically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds
without explicitly resorting to SDP duality.

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are localized waves in electronic,
photonic and acoustic systems, which remain decoupled from surrounding
propagating waves and hence maintain their oscillation for extraordinary long
time [Nat Rev Mater 1, 16048 (2016)]. In photonic crystals, symmetry-protected
quasi-BICs (SP-qBIC) have been realized at high symmetry points of the
Brillouin zone and utilized in photonic crystal and distributed feedback
lasers. In the present work, we measure wavevector-resolved photoluminescence
(PL) of monolayer WSe2 weakly coupled to a photonic slab, consisting of a
square array of aluminum nanodisks. The results show that the slab supports a
continuous band of symmetry-protected quasi-bound states along the Gamma-X
direction, extending from the previously reported SP-qBIC at the Gamma point.
The spectral width of this quasi-bound band in the continuum remains narrow
through at least a half of the Brillouin zone, indicating its long lifetime.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel RF spectrum analyzer using a single-shot technique based on a silicon photonic integrated circuit. The design integrates an ultra-high-resolution speckle spectrometer and an interferometric RF-to-optical encoding scheme, achieving a resolution of 100 MHz on a 10 GHz bandwidth. This compact solution enables fast update rates for RF analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF spectrum analysis is vital for applications like wireless communications, radar, and sensing. Existing chip-scale spectrometers lack the resolution and bandwidth needed for high-performance RF analysis.

Method: The method involves creating a path-mismatched multimode interferometer with inverse designed splitters to reduce loss. A path-mismatched interferometer is used in the RF-to-optical encoding to further enhance resolution.

Result: The system achieves a 10 MHz resolution across a 10 GHz bandwidth, making it suitable for fast and wideband RF analysis.

Conclusion: This approach establishes a compact, single-shot RF spectrum analyzer capable of high-resolution and fast updates, opening new possibilities for RF applications.

Abstract: Designing miniaturized optical spectrometers is an increasingly active area
of research as spectrometers are crucial components for a wide range of
applications including chemical and material analysis, medical diagnostics,
classical and quantum sensing, characterization of light sources, and radio
frequency (RF) spectrum analysis. Among these applications, designing on-chip
spectrometers for RF spectrum analysis is particularly challenging since it
requires combining high resolution and large bandwidth with a fast update rate.
Existing chip-scale spectrometers cannot achieve the resolution required for RF
analysis, setting aside challenges in maintaining a fast update rate and broad
bandwidth. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a silicon
photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based RF spectrum analyzer that combines an
ultra-high-resolution speckle spectrometer with an interferometric
RF-to-optical encoding scheme. The PIC-based speckle spectrometer uses a
path-mismatched multimode interferometer with inverse designed splitters to
compensate for waveguide loss, enabling a record-high resolution of 100 MHz
(0.8 pm at a wavelength of 1550 nm). To further improve the resolution of the
overall RF spectrum analyzer, we modify the RF-to-optical encoding scheme by
directing the RF signal through a path mismatched interferometer and encoding
the outputs of the RF interferometer on separate optical carriers. This further
reduces the RF spectral correlation width of the combined system, enabling the
RF spectrum analyzer to resolve RF tones separated by 10 MHz across a bandwidth
of 10 GHz. Since this approach operates as a single-shot spectrometer, it can
support fast update rates, providing a path to compact, persistent wideband RF
spectrum analysis.

Abstract: We present a single-shot near-field technique to reconstruct the isofrequency
surfaces of metamaterials in the microwave regime. In our approach, we excite
resonant modes using a fixed source in a resonator composed of the material
under test and map the in-plane field distribution with a movable probe.
Applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the measured field reveals the
sample's in-plane dispersion. By extending this analysis over multiple
frequencies and comparing the results with Fabry-P\'erot resonances, we
retrieve the full three-dimensional dispersion relation. When we apply the
method to a double non-connected wire metamaterial, it accurately captures the
low-frequency hyperbolic isofrequency surface, providing both a precise
experimental tool and conceptual insight into spatially dispersive
metamaterials.

Abstract: Achieving spatiotemporal control of light at subwavelength and subcycle
scales is an important milestone in the development of new photonic materials
and technologies. Ultrafast spatiotemporal light modulation currently relies on
electronic interband and intraband transitions that yield pronounced refractive
index changes but typically suffer from slow, picosecond response times due to
carrier relaxation. Here we show that by leveraging resonant light-matter
interactions in a high-quality factor metasurface it is possible to use the
optical Kerr effect, a weaker, but instantaneous optoelectronic polarization
effect, to achieve ultrafast, reconfigurable light modulation with
unprecedented spatial and temporal control. By the subwavelength all-optical
tuning of the refractive index of the dielectric metasurface unit cells, we
experimentally demonstrate pulse-limited beam steering with a 74-fs response
time at angles up to $\pm $13{\deg} in the near-infrared. The steering
originates from the Kerr effect with a background contribution arising from
slower two-photon-excited free carrier absorption. Additionally, we observe
spatial back-action, linear frequency conversion, and demonstrate arbitrary
ultrafast spatial light modulation in two dimensions. Our findings open the
possibility of realizing new ultrafast physics in metastructures with
applications in signal processing, pulse shaping, and ultrafast imaging.

Abstract: Semiconductor photonic devices operating in the midwave infrared (mid-IR,

address a wide range of current practical needs. These include chemical

security monitoring. However, mid-IR device technologies are currently still
works in progress that are generally much less mature than their near infrared

difficult to grow and process, but attainment of the desired optical device
performance is often fundamentally more challenging. This Roadmap will review
the leading applications for mid-IR optoelectronics, summarize the status and
deficiencies of current device technologies, and then suggest possible roadmaps
for improving and maturing the performance, manufacturability, and cost of each
device type so the critical needs that are uniquely addressed by mid-IR

Abstract: We report watt-level femtosecond pulses in the 1.75 $\mu$m region using a

compresses the pulse to 217 fs. Our system generates ~250 nJ of single-pulse

TL;DR: Soliton microcombs with octave-spanning octave-spanning $f$-$2f$ self-referencing show potential applications in spectroscopy and timekeeping. The Raman-induced soliton self-frequency shift (SSFS) is a limiting factor that affects pump-to-comb conversion efficiency and constrains achievable span.

Motivation: The paper focuses on the challenges posed by SSFS in soliton microcombs, which are critical for their applications in spectroscopy and timekeeping. The motivation behind the research is to overcome these limitations and enhance the performance of soliton microcombs.

Method: The authors developed a theoretical framework to explain SSFS in microresonators, considering cases where the soliton duration is shorter than the Raman response timescale. They used numerical simulations and experiments on Si3N4 microresonators to validate their predictions.

Result: The theoretical predictions show that SSFS has a reduced dependence on soliton duration, allowing for soliton existence over a broader range. Numerical simulations and experiments confirm these findings, demonstrating their practical relevance.

Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of SSFS in soliton microcombs and provides guidelines for designing more efficient and broadband soliton microcombs, enhancing their applicability in spectroscopy and timekeeping.

Abstract: Soliton microcombs are evolving towards octave-spanning for $f$-$2f$
self-referencing and expanding applications in spectroscopy and timekeeping. As
spectra broaden and pulses shorten, the Raman-induced soliton self-frequency
shift (SSFS) becomes a principal limitation: it reduces pump-to-comb conversion
efficiency, constrains achievable span, and can, in extremes, preclude
stationary operation. We develop a complementary theory of SSFS in
microresonators that remains valid when the soliton duration $\tau_s$ is
shorter than the Raman response timescale. The theory predicts a reduced
dependence of the SSFS on $\tau_s$ which also expands the soliton existence
range. Such predictions are validated by numerical simulations and by
experiments on Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators. Our results provide practical
guidelines for engineering efficient and broadband soliton microcombs.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field
nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for
each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for
frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap,
plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic
gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the
optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures
magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with
doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop
renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the
third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after
matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a
matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with
published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero
indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current
formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies;
higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees

Motivation: Achieving high data density in optical data storage, especially with UV-readability, is the primary motivation.

Method: The paper uses 10-nm structured silicon with amorphous-to-crystalline phase-change, utilizing the UV properties of the resulting materials.

Result: The study demonstrates that Silicon nanogratings can achieve a 600% maximum optical transmittance contrast at 120 nm, enabling UV-readable data storage with increased data density.

Conclusion: This research paves the way for UV-optical data storage using established silicon nanotechnology, promising a 10 to 100 times increase in data density compared to current standards.

Abstract: Achieving state-of-the-art optical data storage requires raising device
capacity well above commercial standards. This requires media structured at a
much smaller scale and enabling readout at a shorter wavelength. Current CDs,
DVDs and Blu-rays are read with visible light, and are based on metallic
reflection gratings and phase-change recording layers structured at the
few-hundred-nm scale. Herein, we introduce 10-nm structured silicon as a
promising UV-readable data storage platform. Recording on it harnesses the
amorphous-to-crystalline phase-change of silicon, the two phases presenting
well-constrasted UV optical properties. Furthermore, the phase-change contrast
is strongly enhanced in the Vacuum UV thanks to the distinct interband plasmon
resonances of the amorphous and crystalline nanostructures, which have an
epsilon-near-zero and surface plasmonic character, respectively. Silicon
nanogratings with a 10 nm width and a 20 nm period resonate near the wavelength
of 120 nm, at which phase-change induces a 600% maximum optical transmittance
contrast. This paves the way toward UV-readable data storage platforms with a
10 to 100 times increased data density, which could be implemented by
harnessing the well-established silicon nanotechnology.

TL;DR: We formulate the second harmonic generation (SHG) in hybrid structures comprising a 2D crystal and a metasurface waveguide. For low-loss systems, SHG efficiency at leaky resonances is limited by radiative broadening, while at quasi-BICs, it’s capped by inhomogeneous broadening and absorption. We also observe SHG beams even in centrosymmetric systems due to nonlocal mechanisms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding SHG in hybrid systems is crucial for developing efficient nonlinear optics devices, with applications in quantum computing, optical communications, and advanced sensing.

Method: The theoretical framework considers both leaky modes and quasi-BICs, analyzing SHG efficiency using material parameters and polarizability effects. It also examines the polarization properties of diffracted SHG beams.

Result: The SHG efficiency is fundamentally limited by radiative and inhomogeneous processes. Centrosymmetric systems still exhibit SHG beams due to their nonlocal mechanisms.

Conclusion: This work provides guidelines for optimizing nonlinear optical devices and identifies SHG’s ultimate limitations.

Abstract: We present an analytical theory of second harmonic generation (SHG) in hybrid
structures combining a nonlinear 2D crystal with a dielectric metasurface
waveguide. The theory describes the excitation spectrum and enhancement of SHG
at both leaky mode and quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC)
resonances in terms of the material parameters. For low-loss systems, the SHG
efficiency at leaky resonances is determined by their radiative broadening,
governed by the relevant Fourier harmonics of the metasurface polarizability,
whereas the SHG enhancement at quasi-BIC resonances is ultimately limited by
inhomogeneous broadening and absorption in the system. We also describe the
emergence and polarization properties of second harmonic diffracted beams.
These beams appear even if both the 2D crystal and the meta-waveguide are
centrosymmetric owing to the nonlocal mechanism of SHG. The developed framework
provides a systematic theoretical basis for optimizing the resonant nonlinear
frequency conversion in hybrid 2D-material-metasurface platforms and identifies
the fundamental limitations of the SHG efficiency.

Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL) enables optical-frequency analysis of samples with
nanometer resolutions, originating from the interaction of a focused electron
beam with radiative electronic states, or directly with the optical modes of
the sample. Here we decompose the various mechanisms underlying CL generation
and emission from an archetype spherical resonator using its spectral, angular
and spatially resolved features. We investigate radiation of optical
whispering-gallery modes in regimes of coherent and incoherent luminescence.
The use of different experimental regimes allows us to disentangle the
different contributions to the CL in spheres, namely, photon absorption,
generation and radiative leakage, and conclude that the photon generation
occurs precisely on the sphere's surface. In addition, the spheres serve as
high-NA collimating lenses for CL, resulting in mode quality unprecedented for
CL in free space. We believe that such collimated and directed CL in free space
will enhance existing quantum measurements of CL and facilitate new ones, such
as high-rate electron-photon entangled pairs, CL from quantum emitters, and
homodyne analysis of CL.

Motivation: 随着复杂材料和生物组织的广泛存在，对其微观结构和物理特性进行研究显得尤为重要。现有技术在分辨率和测量复杂性方面存在局限性，促使寻求一种新型的测量方法。

Abstract: We demonstrate dark-field x-ray microtomography in a compact,
laboratory-based system capable of resolving attenuation, phase, and
anisotropic scattering signals with micrometer-scale resolution across
centimetre-scale samples. The method is based on two-directional beam tracking
(2DBT), which requires only a single optical element and is compatible with
standard x-ray sources and detectors. We validate the system's capabilities
through imaging of a custom-built phantom, a fibre-reinforced composite and
ex-vivo biological tissues, including a bovine intervertebral disc, a rat
heart, and a porcine meniscus. The results show that dark-field tomography
provides complementary information to attenuation as well as to phase
tomography, by revealing sub-resolution features such as fibre orientation and
microstructural heterogeneity at length scales that are well below the voxel
size. A key element of our system is its sensitivity to scattering along two
orthogonal directions in the image plane, enabling the measurement of
scattering anisotropy with a single exposure. As well as simple and robust, our
approach is sensitive and precise. These findings demonstrate the potential of
2DBT for non-destructive and three-dimensional structural characterisation of
samples and materials in engineering, materials science and biomedical
applications.

Abstract: Contemporary schemes for waveform-resolved characterization are constrained

work reports a comprehensive experimental demonstration that relative yield
measurements from a broad variety of media and nonlinear observables, combined

configurations -- including non-invasive, simultaneous waveform
characterization during an attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS)
experiment -- showcasing the low-cost and non-intrusive nature of the new pulse
characterization approach. Together, this work establishes an easy-to-implement

that is readily accessible to the broader ultrafast science community.

Abstract: This study presents a method for deterministic Er3+ doping of x-cut TFLN
using focused ion beam (FIB) implantation with sub-100 nm spatial precision,
enabling seamless integration of active rare-earth ions into this
technologically relevant platform for lithium niobate integrated nanophotonics.
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements from implanted regions reveal Stark-split
4f-4f transitions consistent with bulk Er-doped lithium niobate, indicating
similar lattice occupation. Temperature-dependent PL measurements from 300 K to
5 K exhibit conventional behaviour down to approximately 50 K, followed by a
marked decrease in the emission intensity and lifetime. This anomaly is
attributed to a suppression of the pyroelectric response in LiNbO3 at low
temperatures, which affects local electric fields and, consequently, Er3+
emission. The sensitivity of the PL response to the modulation frequency and
polarization of the 980 nm excitation light is also consistent with possible
mechanisms linking thermal effects and internal fields arising in the thin
film. The results demonstrate a method for the targeted doping with Er3+ ions
into the most widely used cut of TFLN for integrated photonic devices and
provide further important considerations for their exploitation in cryogenic
quantum devices.

Abstract: Optical spectrometers are indispensable tools across various fields, from
chemical and biological sensing to astronomical observations and quantum
technologies. However, the integration of spectrometers onto photonic chips has
been hindered by the low spectral resolution or large device footprint with
complex multiple channel operations. Here, we introduce a novel chip-integrated
spectrometer by leveraging the acoustically-stimulated Brillouin scattering in
a hybrid photonic-phononic chip. The Brillouin interaction provides a dynamic
reflection grating with a high reflectivity up to 50% and a fast switching time
on the microsecond scale, achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution of
0.56 nm over a 110 nm bandwidth using just a single 1 mm-long straight
waveguide. This remarkable performance approaches the fundamental limit of
resolution for a given device size, validating the potential of the hybrid
photonic-phononic device for efficient and dynamically-reconfigurable spectral
analysis, and thus opens up new avenues for advanced optical signal processing
and sensing applications.

Motivation: The increasing demand for portable and affordable analytical instruments, coupled with the need to perform in situ measurements in various fields, motivated the development of this microspectrophotometer.

Method: The MSP was developed using an innovative illumination system and compact design, allowing simultaneous imaging and spectral recording with micrometer spatial resolution. Performance validation involved comparing absorption and fluorescence spectra of Ru(bpy) with commercial systems using R squared values as a measure of accuracy.

Result: The MSP achieved high accuracy with R squared values of 0.998 for absorbance and 0.990 for fluorescence. It successfully measured spectra of various samples, including dyes, protein crystals, and living cells, demonstrating its versatility and reliability.

Conclusion: The compact, portable design of the MSP significantly outperforms conventional systems in terms of cost and functionality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications where in situ measurements are critical.

Abstract: This article describes the design and construction of a portable, compact,
and cost-effective microspectrophotometer (MSP) that operates in the range of
(200_800 nm). This microscope spectrophotometer records highresolution
absorption and emission spectra in situ. The dual head design of this MSP
enables simultaneous real time imaging and spectral recording of heterogeneous
samples with high selectivity and micrometer spatial resolution. Our compact,
portable MSP design reduces construction costs by more than 20 times compared
to commercial benchtop alternatives, primarily due to its innovative
illumination system and microscope objective design. The performance of the
UV_vis_NIR MSP was confirmed by comparing the absorption and fluorescence
spectra of an aqueous solution of Ru(bpy) obtained with our system to those
measured by commercial spectroscopic systems. The high accuracy and reliability
of our system in measuring absorbance and fluorescence were confirmed by R
squared values of 0.998 and 0.990, respectively, from colorimetric and
fluorometric tests. The MSP was further used to record absorption and
fluorescence spectra from a variety of samples, including dyes and protein
crystals, in both the solution and solid state, as well as individual living
cells. This compact instrument is ideal for rapid, in situ spectroscopic
measurements and is expected to find on site applications across various
fields, such as environmental monitoring, biological research, forensic

Abstract: We establish a comprehensive probability theory for coherent transport of
random waves through arbitrary linear media. The transmissivity distribution
for random coherent waves is a fundamental B-spline with knots at the
transmission eigenvalues. We analyze the distribution's shape, bounds, moments,
and asymptotic behaviors. In the large n limit, the distribution converges to a
Gaussian whose mean and variance depend solely on those of the eigenvalues.
This result resolves the apparent paradox between bimodal eigenvalue
distribution and unimodal transmissivity distribution.

Abstract: Ionization by a sequence of extreme ultraviolet pulses is investigated based
on the rigorous numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation, when the driving laser field is treated exactly. This goes beyond the
typically used first-order nondipole approximation and reveals the effects of
radiation pressure to its full extent. Specifically, we observe the comb
structures in both the momentum and the energy distributions of photoelectrons.
The comb peaks are shifted, however, depending on the emission angle of
electrons. While similar effect is observed already in the first-order
nondipole approximation, with increasing the laser field strength the
discrepancy with our exact results becomes more pronounced. Also, we observe
the additional substructure of the comb peaks arising in the angle-integrated
energy distributions of photoelectrons. Finally, as our numerical calculations
account for the atomic potential in the entire interaction region, we observe
the loss of coherence of comb structures with increasing the number of laser
pulses, that we attribute to rescattering.

Abstract: Parity mixing in photoionization, i.e. when emitted electrons have different
parities but the same energy, causes interference observable only in
angle-resolved measurements. The interference typically manifests as a symmetry
violation in the photoelectron angular distributions. The traditional, based on
HHG, RABBITT scheme with high-order harmonics separated by twice the seed field
energy, precludes parity mixing. On the contrary, a free-electron laser
provides a possibility to generate even harmonics. Using triple the fundamental
frequency as a seed, one obtains a comb of alternating even and odd harmonics,
separated by three times the initial frequency [Nature 578, 386-391 (2020)]
(2-SB RABBITT). In this setup, there are two sidebands between the main
photoelectron lines, versus one in the traditional scheme. In the paper, we
examine the general properties of a two-sideband scheme and analyze the
symmetry breakdown of photoelectron angular distributions for various
polarization geometries of the incident pulse. We found a crucial difference in
symmetries between 2-SB RABBITT and other photoionization schemes with parity
mixing. Illustrative calculations are carried out for neon with pulse
parameters typical for modern facilities. The possibility to reconstruct the
temporal profile of the pulse from the angle-resolved measurements is
discussed.

pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined
with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the
`hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron
scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears
at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed
by neutron or X-ray scattering.

### [100] [Competitive Orders in Altermagnetic Chiral Magnons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03922)
*Congzhe Yan,Jinyang Ni*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: In alternative magnets, magnons display chiral splitting without spin-orbit coupling or external magnetic fields. Chiral splitting is typically described by low-temperature isotropic spin exchanges (ISE), but its behavior at finite temperatures is unclear. Magnon-magnon interactions mediated by long-range anisotropic spin exchanges (ASE) can induce chiral splitting at finite temperatures. This splitting induced by ASE competes with that from ISE, leading to temperature-dependent modulation of the chiral splitting. The competition is linked to spin fluctuations, reversing the spin current as temperature increases. This work reveals intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in alternative magnets, offering new insights into their finite-temperature dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the mechanisms of magnon chiral splitting in alternative magnets, particularly the interplay between isotropic spin exchange (ISE) and anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) at finite temperatures, and how this interplay is influenced by magnon-magnon interactions and spin fluctuations.

Method: Theoretical framework and numerical simulations were used to investigate the effects of ISE, ASE, and magnon-magnon interactions on magnon chiral splitting in alternative magnets.

Result: Magnon-magnon interactions induced by ASE contribute to the chiral splitting of magnons at finite temperatures, which competes with ISE-mediated splitting. This competition leads to a pronounced temperature-dependent modulation of the chiral splitting. The interplay between these spin exchange mechanisms and magnon-magnon interactions is closely linked to spin fluctuations and can reverse the spin current driven by band splitting as temperature increases.

Conclusion: The study reveals a new intrinsic competition between ISE and ASE mediated by magnon-magnon interactions, significantly affecting the finite-temperature dynamic behavior of chiral magnons in alternative magnets. This understanding enhances our knowledge of the complex interplay between spin exchange mechanisms and magnon interactions in magnetic systems.

Abstract: In altermagnets, magnons-the quanta of collective spin excitations-exhibit
chiral splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and external
magnetic fields. Typically, this chiral splitting behavior can be well
described by alternating isotropic spin exchanges (ISE) in the low-temperature
regime; however, its dynamic behavior at a finite temperature remains unclear.
In this study, we reveal that, when including magnon-magnon interactions, long
range anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) can also induce chiral splitting of
magnons at a finite temperature. Crucially, the chiral splitting induced by ASE
competes with that arising from ISE, leading to a pronounced temperature
dependent modulation of the altermagnetic chiral splitting. Moreover, this
competition is intimately connected to spin fluctuations, and can reverse the
spin current driven by the band splitting as temperature increases. Our work
uncovers the intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in
altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical
behavior.

Abstract: We report ARPES studies combined with DFT+DMFT calculations to confirm that
the magnetic ordering vector transition from \textbf{Q}=(1/2,0,0) to
\textbf{Q}=(1/3,0,0) in the metallic triangular antiferromagnets
Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ ($\epsilon\approx$0.007) is induced by the
electronic structure change in the system. The ARPES-measured Fermi surface
(FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like
FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by
taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co
3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron
pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the
correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The
magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the DFT+DMFT band structure
indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector changes to (1/3,0,0)
from (1/2,0,0), which is very consistent with the magnetic phase transition
around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.

Abstract: We study the $T=0$ phase diagrams of models of bilayers of $S=1/2$ square
lattices antiferromagnets with SU(2) Heisenberg symmetry that have 2, 4, and 6
spin exchanges. We study two families of bilayer models with distinct internal
symmetries and, hence, different phase diagram topologies. A traditional
bilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two
layers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to
achieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase
diagram is rich with N\'eel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and
both first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are
consistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the
second family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no
spin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot
occur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are
accessed for the first time. We find that the phase transition between N\'eel
and VBS is first order in both the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models,
although they have strikingly distinct finite-size scaling behavior and that
the transition from VBS to dimer in the spin-spin coupling model deviates from
the expected scenario of an XY model with dangerously irrelevant four-fold
anisotropy.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between altermagnetic band structures and
electronic correlations by focusing on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic
generalization of the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. We find that with increasing
interaction, a many-body Lifshitz transition takes place when doubly occupied
regions disappear from the Fermi surface and each momentum state becomes fully
spin polarized. The spin susceptibility is directly evaluated from the Kubo
formula in terms of many-body occupation probabilities. We find that the
dynamical susceptibility, which possesses only transverse non-zero components
for small wavevectors, develops a gap proportional to the interaction strength,
and displays a sharp peak at a frequency increasing with the interaction. %with
increasing frequency. Above the Lifshitz transition, this peak moves to the
lower gap edge and becomes log-divergent. The signal intensity increases with
the interaction up until the Lifshitz transition and saturates afterwards. The
static susceptibility remains unaffected by the correlations and altermagnetism

*Zeinab Bakhshipour,Mir Vahid Hosseini*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of disorder on the helical edge of a 2D topological insulator in the presence of a Zeeman field and superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is to understand how disorder impacts charge- and spin-density wave correlations and superconducting pair correlations in topological insulators under the influence of a Zeeman field and superconductivity.

Method: The researchers employed bosonization and a renormalization-group analysis to theoretically model and calculate the modifications in charge- and spin-density wave correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations caused by impurity potentials.

Result: The findings indicate that the Zeeman field plays a critical role in controlling the competition between attractive and repulsive regimes. In the attractive regime, the Zeeman field amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by maintaining the system longer in a relevant regime for disorder. Additionally, disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations and introduces positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.

Conclusion: This paper offers a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the interplay between disorder, Zeeman field, and superconductivity in 2D topological insulators, with practical implications for the design and manipulation of topological edge channels in potential experiments.

Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the
helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman
field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group
analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave
correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal
that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it
amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes
impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for
disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of
transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing
positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations
and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of
spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the
interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.

### [105] [T-square electric resistivity and its thermal counterpart in RuO$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04278)
*Yu Ling,Florent Pawula,Ramzy Daou,Benoît Fauqué,Kamran Behnia*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper studies the low-temperature electric and thermal transport properties of RuO$_2$, a metallic oxide. The electric resistivity shows a quadratic temperature dependence (T$^2$) below ~20 K, with a prefactor consistent with the Kadowaki-Woods scaling. Phonon scattering also contributes to the resistivity with a T$^5$ term. Thermal conductivity measurements reveal that the electronic component follows the Wiedemann-Franz law at low temperatures but deviates at finite temperatures, with the ratio of the thermal to electric T$^2$ resistivities being about three times larger than expected. These findings suggest that RuO$_2$ can be treated as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid, providing valuable insights for theoretical studies of electron-electron scattering in metallic oxides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in the continued interest in understanding the electrical and thermal properties of RuO$_2$, especially in the context of its status as a Fermi liquid. Previous studies have not thoroughly investigated the quadratic temperature dependence of electric resistivity, which this paper aims to fill in by providing precise measurements and analysis.

Method: The study involved measuring the electric resistivity and thermal conductivity of four different RuO$_2$ samples across a range of temperatures, including zero and high magnetic fields. Techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) may have been employed to analyze the electronic structure and transport properties, while thermal transport measurements likely involved specialized devices to measure thermal conductivity at low temperatures.

Result: The results confirm that RuO$_2$ exhibits a T$^2$ electric resistivity with a prefactor consistent with the Kadowaki-Woods scaling, suggesting weak electron correlations. The phonon contribution is identified as a T$^5$ term in the resistivity. Thermal conductivity measurements reveal that the electronic component follows the Wiedemann-Franz law at zero temperature but deviates at finite temperatures, with the thermal to electric T$^2$ resistivity ratio being about three times larger than predicted.

Conclusion: These results establish RuO$_2$ as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid, supporting its position as a candidate for studying electronic-phonon interactions in metallic oxides. The findings provide a solid foundation for further theoretical work on electron-electron scattering in such materials.

Abstract: We present a study of low-temperature electric and thermal transport in
RuO$_2$, a metallic oxide which has attracted much recent attention. Careful
scrutiny of electric resistivity reveals a quadratic temperature dependence
below $\sim$ 20 K undetected in previous studies of electronic transport in
this material. The prefactor of this T$^2$ resistivity, given the electronic
specific heat, corresponds to what is expected by the Kadowaki-Woods scaling.
The variation of its amplitude across 4 different samples is negligible despite
an eightfold variation of residual resistivity. There is also a T$^5$
resistivity due to scattering by phonons. By measuring thermal conductivity,
$\kappa$, at zero field and at 12 T, we separated its electronic and the
phononic components and found that the electronic component respects the
Wiedemann-Franz law at zero temperature and deviates downward at finite
temperature. The latter corresponds to a threefold discrepancy between the
prefactors of the two (thermal and electric) T-square resistivities. Our
results, establishing RuO$_2$ as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid, provide new
input for the ongoing theoretical attempt to give a quantitative account of
electron-electron scattering in metallic oxides starting from first principles.

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何扩展现有的双环分组编码理论到任意维量子位系统，为量子拓扑序研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$
bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of
modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB
codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that
the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be
determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$
are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i
p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the
well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular,
this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric
methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon
fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's
symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior,
resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a
computational algebraic method using Gr\"{o}bner bases over the ring of
integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.

Abstract: We study the correlated electronic structure and local spin behaviour of the
copper-substituted lead-vanadium bromine apatite Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$
using DFT+DMFT with a two-orbital Cu-centred low-energy model. Simulations are
done for several temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a broad range of band
fillings 2.46 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 3.54. We find that the present compound stays
metallic even once correlations are treated dynamically around the
stoichiometric filling (n $\simeq$ 3). Away from n $\simeq$ 3, both hole and
electron doping drive the system toward non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, and
spectral weight is transferred from the low-energy peak into upper and lower
Hubbard-like features. By analysing the low-frequency self-energy exponent and
the dynamical part of the local spin susceptibility, we identify a narrow
window of enhanced spin fluctuations on the slightly hole-doped side (n
$\simeq$ 2.94), i.e. a spin-freezing-crossover regime of the kind reported in
the literature for multiorbital Hund metals. This places
Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ among the promising members of the Cu-substituted
apatite family.

Abstract: We propose N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulators with a buckled
honeycomb structure as potential candidates to host a high-temperature AF Chern
insulator (AFCI). Using a generalized Kondo lattice model we show that the
staggered potential induced by a perpendicular electric field due to the
buckling can drive the AF Mott insulator to an AFCI phase. We address the
temperature evolution of the Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The
quantization temperature $T_q$, below which the Hall conductance is quantized,
depends essentially on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the hopping
parameter, independent of the specific details of the model. The deviation of
the Hall conductance from the quantized value $e^2/h$ above $T_q$ is found to
be accompanied by a spectral broadening of the chiral edge states, reflecting a
finite life-time, i.e., a decay. Using parameters typical for heavy
transition-metal elements we predict that the AFCI can survive up to room
temperature. We suggest Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ as a potential compound to realize
a high-$T$ AFCI phase.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an analytic, first-order description of how black hole ringdown
imprints on the operational signature of near-horizon thermality. Building on a
static Schwarzschild baseline in which a freely falling two-level system
coupled to a single outgoing mode exhibits geometric photon statistics and a
detailed-balance ratio set by the surface gravity, we introduce an even-parity,
axisymmetric quadrupolar perturbation and work in an ingoing
Eddington-Finkelstein, horizon-regular framework. The perturbation corrects the
outgoing eikonal through a gauge-invariant double-null contraction of the
metric, yielding a compact redshift map that, when pulled back to the detector
worldline, produces a universal, decaying-oscillatory modulation of the
Boltzmann exponent at the quasinormal frequency. We derive a closed boundary
formula for the response coefficient at the sampling radius, identify the
precise adiabatic window in which the result holds, and prove that the
modulation vanishes in all stationary limits. Detector specifics (gap,
switching wavepacket width) enter only through a smooth prefactor, while the
geometric content is captured by the quasinormal pair and the response
coefficient. The analysis clarifies that near-horizon "thermality" is robust
but not rigid: detailed balance persists as the organizing structure and is
gently driven by ringdown dynamics. The framework is minimal yet extensible to
other multipoles, parities, and slow rotation, and it suggests direct numerical
and experimental cross-checks in controlled analog settings.

Abstract: We study a system of a self-gravitating condensate, a boson star, formed from
scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM), with a black hole hosted at its center.
We numerically solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the
non-relativistic limit, consistently incorporating the gravitational potential
of the black hole, to obtain all possible configurations of this BS-BH system
for different boson star masses, interaction types, and black hole masses. We
also propose an analytic expression for the density profile and compare it with
the numerical results, finding good agreement for attractive interactions and
for a finite range of mass ratios between the black hole and boson star.
Finally, considering the inspiral of this BS-BH system with a second, smaller
black hole, we study the dephasing of gravitational waves due to the presence
of the ULDM environment. A Fisher matrix analysis reveals the regions of
parameter space of the ULDM mass and self-coupling that future
gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA can probe.

TL;DR: Supermassive black hole images from the EHT allow testing GR and other gravity theories. Future projects like ngEHT and BHEX aim to probe extreme gravity. Simulations of accreting BHs deviating from Kerr suggest future missions can distinguish these solutions with image mismatch above 2% to 5%, enabling percent-level image fidelity to constrain GR deviations and test strong-field predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave and imaging missions to test general relativity and alternative theories of gravity is motivated by the need to probe fundamental physics and explore extreme astrophysical phenomena.

Method: General-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and radiative-transfer simulations were used to investigate the images of a wide class of accreting black holes that deviate from the Kerr solution. Image mismatch was measured between different black hole images.

Result: Future missions will be able to distinguish a large class of black hole solutions from the Kerr solution when the mismatch in the images exceeds values between 2% and 5% depending on the image-comparison metric considered. This indicates that future horizon-scale imaging with percent-level image fidelity can place meaningful observational constraints on deviations from the Kerr metric and thereby test strong-field predictions of general relativity.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that future space-based imaging missions will significantly advance our ability to test general relativity and alternative theories of gravity by leveraging the extreme precision in image measurement.

Abstract: The horizon-scale images of supermassive black holes (BHs) by the Event
Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) have provided new opportunities to test
general relativity and other theories of gravity. In view of future projects,
such as the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Black-Hole
Explorer (BHEX), having the potential of enhancing our ability to probe extreme
gravity, it is natural to ask: \textit{how much can two black-hole images
differ?} To address this question and assess the ability of these projects to
test theories of gravity with black-hole shadows, we use general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic and radiative-transfer simulations to investigate the
images of a wide class of accreting BHs deviating from the Kerr solution. By
measuring the mismatch between images of different BHs we show that future
missions will be able to distinguish a large class of BHs solutions from the
Kerr solution when the mismatch in the images exceeds values between $2\%$ and
$5\%$ depending on the image-comparison metric considered. These results
indicate future horizon-scale imaging with percent-level image fidelity can
place meaningful observational constraints on deviations from the Kerr metric
and thereby test strong-field predictions of general relativity.

Abstract: We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of
black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are
constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically
complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and
may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on
scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting
effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the
mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes
and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for
potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the
possible presence or absence of echo effects.

Abstract: We explore charged black holes in Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG),
unveiling their distinctive features across multiple physical domains. Our
topological analysis reveals that the STVG coupling parameter $\alpha$ bolsters
thermal stability while electromagnetic charge $Q$ weakens it. Using the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we find that $\alpha$ amplifies light deflection and
enlarges shadow silhouettes, with $Q$ generating opposite effects. Our
quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms pinpoint phase
transitions in the microscopic regime, modifying conventional thermodynamic
relationships. Calculations of strong gravitational lensing, shadow geometry,
and Hawking emission show clear STVG signatures that diverge from Einstein's
predictions. Notably, our accretion disk analysis uncovers an intriguing
phenomenon: specific combinations of $\alpha$ and $Q$ can produce radiation
patterns resembling spinning Kerr black holes, creating potential
identification challenges for observers. These findings establish concrete
observational tests for STVG theory through next generation astronomical
imaging and lensing campaigns. By connecting theoretical predictions to
measurable quantities, we outline specific pathways to confirm or constrain
STVG using data from current and future space telescopes.

Abstract: The requirement that a trapped spacetime domain forms in finite time for
distant observers is logically possible and sometimes unavoidable, but its
consequences are not yet fully understood. In spherical symmetry, the
characterization of the near-horizon geometry of these physical black holes is
complete and shows marked differences from their eternal counterparts. Whether
these differences lead to observable signatures remains unclear. We construct
an approximate near-horizon metric that encapsulates them and is suitable for
modeling. The timelike apparent horizon of physical black holes provides a
natural surface for a consistent membrane description: we obtain closed-form
expressions for the redshift, proper acceleration, and extrinsic curvature, and
assign a two-dimensional viscous-fluid stress tensor via junction conditions.
These results also provide an additional perspective on the relation between
Rindler and near-horizon geometries. Among dynamical generalizations of surface
gravity, only a subset applies to these models. We complete their analysis and
recover the intuitive definition of surface gravity -- the acceleration in the
frame of a near-horizon observer, redshifted to infinity -- directly from the
membrane acceleration.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We numerically investigate the superradiant amplification effect of a charged
scalar filed in the scattering experiment and the black hole bomb model in a
charged black-bounce spacetime. Due to the shallowing effect on the effective
potential by the introduced quantum parameter $\l$, superradiance in both the
above cases are verified to be weakened. In a scattering experiment, the
quantum parameter and the field mass suppress the amplification in all
frequency ranges, while the black hole and field charge influence it
differently in high and low frequencies. In a Type I black hole bomb model,
where the reflective mirror is placed outside the ergo-region, we find a new
distinct eigen-mode for the scalar field evolution in a high $\l$ value, which
is however absent in the case of Type II black bomb where the mirror is set
inside the ergo-region. Moreover, we investigate the heavy field mass scenario
in a Type II black hole bomb and find no amplification effect in this confined
configuration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring deviations in gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity offers insights into alternative theories of gravity and the potential existence of additional force carriers like gravitons.

Method: The study employs LISA simulations over 5 years to analyze three hypotheses about SMBHB mergers, determining constraints on the graviton mass and dispersion coefficients.

Result: Simulations yield graviton mass constraints of 9.50×10^-27 to 9.05×10^-27 eV/c², along with corresponding dispersion limits.

Conclusion: The proposed method could effectively utilize electromagnetic counterparts for independent measurements of gravitational wave speed, advancing our understanding of quantum gravity effects in astrophysical systems.

Abstract: According to General Relativity (GR), gravitational waves (GWs) should travel
at the speed of light $c$. However, some theories beyond GR predict deviations
of the velocity of GWs $c_{\rm gw}$ from $c$, and some of those expect vacuum
dispersion. Therefore, probing the propagation effects of GWs by comparing the
wave format detectors against the one at emission excepted from GR. Since such
propagation effects accumulate through larger distance, it is expected that
super-massive black holes binary (SMBHB) mergers serve as better targets than
their stellarmass equivalent. In this paper, we study with simulations on how
observations on a population of SMBHs can help to study this topic. We simulate
LISA observations on three possible SMBHB merger populations, namely
Pop\MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 3}, Q3-nod and Q3-d over a 5-year mission. The
resulting constraints on the graviton mass are \(9.50\), \(9.33\), and \(9.05
\times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{eV}/c^2\), respectively. We also obtain the
corresponding constraints on the dispersion coefficients assuming different
dispersion scenarios. If the electromagnetic wave counterparts of SMBHB merger
can be detected simultaneously, the $c_{\rm gw}$ can be constrained
waveform-independently to \(\Delta c/c\) to \(10^{-13}-10^{-12}\),
corresponding to graviton mass constraints of \(10^{-26}-10^{-24}
\mathrm{eV}/c^2\).

Abstract: It is widely believed that Sgr A$^*$, located at the center of our Galaxy, is
a supermassive black hole. Recent observations of its shadow and long-term
monitoring of the S2 star have provided compelling evidence supporting this
hypothesis. These observational advancements also offer valuable opportunities
to explore the physical properties of the black hole and its surrounding
environment. Since a dark matter halo is expected to exist in the Milky Way and
around Sgr A$^*$, investigating the behavior of the Galactic Center black hole
embedded in such a halo provides a crucial means to simultaneously probe both
black hole physics and dark matter properties. In this work, We develop a black
hole metric that incorporates a generalized double power law dark matter halo,
and analyze the corresponding null and timelike geodesics to investigate how
the halo parameters affect the black hole shadow and the motion of the S2 star.
Furthermore, by comparing our theoretical predictions with observational data
of the shadow and the S2 orbit, we constrained the dark matter halo parameters.
The results of this study provide both theoretical and phenomenological
insights into the nature of Sgr A$^*$ and the distribution of dark matter in
our Galaxy.

Abstract: The deep connection between black hole thermodynamics and spacetime geometry
remains a central focus of general relativity. While recent studies have
revealed a precise correspondence for null orbits, given by $K = -\lambda^2$
between the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, its
validity for timelike orbits had remained unknown. Our work introduces the
massive particle surface (MPS) framework and constructs a new geometric
quantity $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{G} \propto -\lambda^2$ on
unstable timelike orbits, thus establishing the geometry-dynamics
correspondence for massive particles. Crucially, near the first-order phase
transition of a black hole, $\mathcal{G}$ displays synchronized multivalued
behavior with the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and yields a critical exponent
$\delta=1/2$. Our results demonstrate that spacetime geometry encodes
thermodynamic information, opening a new pathway for studying black hole phase
transitions from a geometric perspective.

### [120] [Equivalence of scalar-tensor theories and scale-dependent gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04467)
*Philipp Neckam,Christian Käding,Benjamin Koch,Cristobal Laporte,Mario Pitschmann,Ali Riahinia,Angel Rincon*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We present a novel relationship between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories, showing how one can be embedded into the other and how they can be rewritten in either form. This relationship is established at both the action and field equation levels, and it reveals a natural promotion of the scale factor to a dynamical field. The findings are consistent with existing equivalences and can be applied to specific examples from both theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between different gravitational theories is crucial for unifying our knowledge of gravity and exploring its implications in cosmology and quantum gravity. This paper aims to clarify the connections between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories, providing new insights into their structure and potential applications.

Method: We start by defining the general forms of scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories, then establish a correspondence between them by mapping their action principles and field equations. We derive the exact conditions under which such a correspondence holds and verify them with explicit examples.

Result: We find that every well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theory can be uniquely embedded into a scalar-tensor theory, and conversely, scalar-tensor theories can be expressed in multiple equivalent forms of scale-dependent gravity. This duality expands our understanding of the equivalence classes of gravitational theories and provides tools for translating results between them.

Conclusion: This work reveals a significant equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories, offering a powerful framework for analyzing and relating these theories. It also paves the way for exploring quantum aspects and applications in cosmology within this unified context.

Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and
scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical
kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric
tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent
gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique
way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a
scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of
the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context
of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to
a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic
term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new
equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the
aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence
relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and
scalar-tensor theories.

Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to
a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of
entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity,
starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an
explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function,
which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an
anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may
resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with
modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide
class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis,
logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications,
and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical
properties and energy conditions.

Abstract: Finslerian extensions of Special and General Relativity -- commonly referred
to as Very Special and Very General Relativity -- necessitate the development
of a unified Lorentz-Finsler geometry. However, the scope of this geometric
framework extends well beyond relativistic physics. Indeed, it offers powerful
tools for modeling wave propagation in classical mechanics, discretizing
spacetimes in classical and relativistic settings, and supporting effective
theories in fundamental physics. Moreover, Lorentz-Finsler geometry provides a
versatile setting that facilitates the resolution of problems within
Riemannian, Lorentzian, and Finslerian geometries individually. This work
presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts,
key applications, and future prospects.
  The reviewed topics include (i) basics on the setting of cones, Finsler and
Lorentz-Finsler metrics and their (nonlinear, anisotropic and linear)
connections, (ii) the global structure of Lorentz-Finsler manifolds and its
space of null geodesics, (iii) links among Riemannian, Finsler and Lorentz
geometries, (iv) real world applications for wildfires and seisms, and
discretization in classical and relativistic settings with quantum prospects,
and (v) Finslerian variational approach to Einstein equations. The new results
include the splitting of globally hyperbolic Finsler spacetimes, in addition to
the analysis of several extensions as the case of timelike boundaries.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the threshold of collapse of a massless complex scalar field
in axisymmetric spacetimes under the ansatz of Choptuik et al. 2004, in which a
symmetry depending on the azimuthal parameter $m$ is imposed on the scalar
field. This allows for both non-vanishing twist and angular momentum. We extend
earlier work to include higher angular modes. Using the pseudospectral code
bamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon,
and a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve
near-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest
nontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete
self-similarity with echoing period $\Delta\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling
with exponent $\gamma\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work. For $m=2$ we
find that universality is maintained within this nonzero fixed-$m$ symmetry
class but with smaller period and critical exponents, $\Delta\simeq0.09$ and
$\gamma\simeq0.035$, establishing an explicit dependence of the critical
solution on the angular mode. Analysis of the relation between the angular
momentum and the mass of apparent horizons at the instant of formation,
$J_{\mathrm{AH}}{-}M_{\mathrm{AH}}$, shows that the effect of angular momentum
is minimal at the threshold, with
$\chi_{\mathrm{AH}}=J_{\mathrm{AH}}/M_{\mathrm{AH}}^2\to0$, and, therefore,
excludes extremal black holes for the families under consideration. Our results
demonstrate that while universality and DSS hold within each $m$-sector, the
critical universal values vary with $m$, and neither extremality nor
bifurcation occur in the complex scalar field model within the families
considered here.

Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and
astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such
a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field
approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a
simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with
canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either
preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is
well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such
a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate
that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate
with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to
distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the
complex scalar field.

Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state
in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a
Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the
Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity
and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence
between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify
dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To
illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group
manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and
integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses
to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice
model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded
lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example
illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of
complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.

Conclusion: 此辛结构公式在开弦场论中是合理的，计算了滚动复桃能纯，尤其是在处理了奇异紫外行为后，结果符合预期，而且在局域场论模型中也提供了有用的见解。

Abstract: We discuss a new formula for the symplectic structure on the phase space of
open string field theory. Revisiting the setup of Cho, Mazel, and Yin, we use
the formula to compute the energy of rolling tachyon solutions on unstable
D-branes. An important aspect of the analysis is dealing with the singular
ultraviolet behavior of string vertices in Lorentzian signature, a feature we
refer to as transgressive locality. This forces us to carry out computations in
momentum space, where time and causality are somewhat obscure. Nevertheless the
symplectic structure appears to be sensible, giving results in agreement with
boundary state computations. As further confirmation of our methods, we study
the symplectic structure for rolling tachyons in scalar effective field theory,
where vertices show similar high energy behavior to string field theory but the
physics is that of local field theory. This model gives interesting insight
into the runaway oscillations of the rolling tachyon.

Abstract: We investigate entanglement entropy in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model,
its holographic interpretation in terms of edge modes (acting as quantum
reference frames); particularly its de Sitter (dS) space limit; and its
connection with Krylov complexity. We define subsystems relative to a particle
insertion in the boundary theory. This leads to a natural notion of partial
trace and reduced density matrices. The corresponding entanglement entropy
takes the form of a generalized horizon entropy in the bulk dual; revealing the
emergence of edge modes in the entangling surfaces. We match the entanglement
entropy of the DSSYK in an appropriate limit to an area computed through a
\emph{Ryu-Takayanagi formula} in dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at
$\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$; providing a first principles example of holographic
entanglement entropy for dS$_2$ space. This formula reproduces the
Gibbons-Hawking entropy for specific entangling regions points; while it
decreases for others. This construction does not display some of the puzzling
features in dS holography. The entanglement entropy remains real-valued (since
the boundary theory is unitary), and it depends on Krylov state complexity in
this limit.

Abstract: We consider a de Sitter observer in his rest frame at late times who observes
a particle slightly displaced from unstable equilibrium. Initially, the
observer notices an axisymmetric and parity-violating deformation along the
trajectory of the displaced particle of his cosmological horizon. On a time
scale of order $\ell$, the de Sitter radius, the particle is nearly absorbed by
the cosmological horizon and has been accelerated to an ultra-relativistic
speed and thus is well approximated as a shock wave. In the shock wave limit,
the observer sees an axisymmetric deformation of his horizon with parity
restored, which we interpret as arising due to a particle from the
complementary static patch. We comment on the holographic implications of this
result and note that there is no need to extend the holographic screen of de
Sitter spacetime beyond the empty static patch to account for this signal.

Abstract: We describe a holographic mechanism for black hole formation via the
collision of two shockwaves in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In
the dual conformal field theory (CFT), a two-shockwave state corresponds to the
insertion of two boosted precursor operators in complementary Rindler patches.
Their operator product expansion is initially described by a universal mean
field spectrum of exchanged states, which is dominated by operator dimensions
that grow exponentially in the boost parameter. We propose their mean value as
diagnosing the mass of the collision product in the bulk. It crosses the CFT
heavy state threshold after two scrambling times, in accordance with
expectations about black hole formation in general relativity. Our analysis
also allows us to identify the scrambling characteristics usually associated
with out-of-time-order correlation functions, using only the internal
composition of thermal in-time-order correlators.

Abstract: We introduce and study a class of two-dimensional integrable quantum field
theories that carry an internal $\mathbb{Z}_n$ structure. These models extend
factorised scattering beyond the conventional framework, featuring both the
usual hierarchy of integer-spin conserved charges and an additional tower of
fractional-spin ones. Our construction relies on a reparametrisation of
rapidity space that lifts standard scattering amplitudes to a multiplet related
by an internal cyclic symmetry. This construction is naturally embedded within
a generalised Gibbs ensemble, which provides the natural framework for a
consistent graded Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. This leads to new Y-systems
encoding the graded spectrum. In a special case, these functional relations
match those obtained via the ODE/IM correspondence from the monodromy analysis
of the quantum cubic oscillator. Even in the simplest models, for one sign of
the auxiliary temperature, the finite-volume ground-state energy spectrum
undergoes an infinite sequence of level-crossing phenomena as the coupling
strength increases. A preliminary analysis also suggests that these theories
exhibit structural connections with cyclic orbifolds. Within this setup, one
can consistently include extra CDD factors that realise fractional-spin
analogues of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. In analytically tractable cases, a
Hagedorn-like behaviour is observed for a sign of the flow parameter, and the
deformed spectrum develops a finite limiting temperature.

Abstract: One of the long-standing puzzles in string theory has been on the existence
of a four-dimensional de Sitter and quasi de Sitter configurations, the latter
being defined with a temporally varying dark energy, in E_8 x E_8 and SO(32)
heterotic theories. In this work, novel dynamical duality-sequences are devised
that provide natural constructions of de Sitter and quasi de Sitter excited
states in the aforementioned theories allowing no late-time singularities. The
emergent positive dark energies -- including the intriguing possibility of
their slow temporal variations -- appear from Borel resumming Gevrey series
from the path-integral representations of such states. Additionally, precise
ways to handle the equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations
and anomaly cancellations -- consistent with the underlying axionic cosmology
and with the probability of forming wormholes that connect baby universes --
are presented for the SO(32) and the E_8 x E_8 theories within a framework that
systematically incorporates perturbative and non-perturbative corrections in
the far infrared. The temporally varying dark energy, which is much more
natural in our set-up because of its emergent nature, surprisingly simplifies
many of the aforementioned computations. Interestingly, our analysis also
provides, probably for the first time, a set-up to consistently embed
four-dimensional standard model degrees of freedom at late time in a realistic
gravitational background with positive dark energy from string theory.

Abstract: The thermodynamics of de Sitter black holes is complicated by the presence of
two horizons and the absence of a globally defined timelike Killing vector. The
standard choice of the Gibbons-Hawking Killing vector is at odds with the
interpretation of the surface gravity as an acceleration measured by a physical
observer at rest. Focusing on four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter
black holes we show that this issue can be resolved by adopting a normalization
originally proposed by Bousso and Hawking, which defines thermodynamic
quantities relative to the unique freely-falling observer at a fixed radial
coordinate. Within this framework, we derive new first laws for the black hole
and cosmological horizon and re-examine the black hole's heat capacity. We find
that the heat capacity remains finite in the near-extremal Nariai limit, thus
averting a breakdown of the semi-classical thermodynamic description. However,
the heat capacity does vanish in the cold limit, as expected, and for Nariai
black holes in the ultracold limit, indicating that fundamental limitations on
the statistical description persist in these regimes. We discuss the
implications of our results for log-$T$ corrections to near-extremal de Sitter
black holes.

Abstract: Just as linearized perturbations of time-independent configurations can be
decomposed into normal modes, those of periodic systems can be decomposed into
Floquet modes, which each evolve by a fixed phase over one period. We show that
in the case of a (1+1)-dimensional relativistic field theory with a single
scalar of mass $m$, all breathers, quasi-breathers and oscillons of length
$1/\epsilon$ have identical nonrelativistic Floquet modes at leading order in
an $\epsilon/m$ expansion. More precisely, these Floquet modes depend only on
$\epsilon$ and $m$, and are independent of the potential of the theory. In
particular, there is a continuum of Floquet modes corresponding to each real
momentum plus four discrete modes corresponding to space translations, time
translations, boosts and amplitude changes. There are no discrete shape modes.
We provide simple, explicit formulas for these universal leading-order,
nonrelativistic Floquet modes.

Abstract: Recently, a potential for string backgrounds is obtained from string geometry
theory, which is a candidate for the non-perturbative formulation of string
theory. By substituting a string phenomenological model with free parameters to
the potential, one obtains a potential for the free parameters, whose minimum
determines the free parameters. The model with the determined parameters is the
ground state in the model. This will be the local minimum in a partial region
of the model in the string theory landscape. By comparing it with the other
local minimum, one can determine which model is near the minimum of the
potential for string backgrounds, that will be the true vacuum in string
theory, in the sense of the values of the potential. We will be able to find
the true vacuum in string theory through a series of such researches. In this
paper, we perform this analysis of a certain simple heterotic
non-supersymmetric model explicitly, where the six-dimensional internal spaces
are products of two-dimensional spaces of constant curvatures, and the
generation number of massless fermions is given by the flux quantization
numbers. As a result, we obtain a constraint between the compactification scale
and the flux quanta.

The framework aligns with Planck data and laboratory bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reconcile quantum field theory with general relativity by proposing a self-consistent quantum vacuum framework that accounts for macroscopic order parameters and derives low-energy effective equations.

Method: The method uses a background-field, heat-kernel approach to derive coupled low-energy effective field equations from the postulate of self-consistent quantum vacuum fluctuations.

Result: The framework successfully recovers Einstein, Yang-Mills, and Higgs equations with higher-derivative corrections. It predicts Starobinsky-type inflation aligned with Planck data, quantifies corrections to Newton's potential and Yukawa tails within laboratory bounds, and enforces luminal gravitational wave speed.

Conclusion: This work provides a predictive and consistent framework for understanding low-energy quantum gravity effects.

Abstract: The principle of self-consistency of the quantum vacuum postulates that the
classical backgrounds we observe -- spacetime, gauge fields, and the Higgs
condensate -- are macroscopic order parameters of a single quantum state
sustained by its own fluctuations. Building on this postulate, a
background-field, heat-kernel based derivation is developed that yields the
coupled low-energy effective field equations for the metric, gauge, and Higgs
fields as vacuum "equations of state." The framework rigorously recovers the
Einstein, Yang-Mills, and Higgs equations, augmented by the higher-derivative
operators required by quantum consistency. Phenomenological consequences
follow. First, the anomaly- and loop-induced R^2 operator generically drives
Starobinsky-type inflation, compatible with Planck data. Second, the
universally calculable quantum correction to Newton's potential and the Yukawa
tails from massive spin-0 and spin-2 modes are quantified and shown to satisfy
laboratory bounds. Third, constraints from GW170817 enforce luminal
gravitational wave speed. The theory is predictive in its inflationary sector
and in its universal low-energy corrections to gravity, reducing to General
Relativity and the Standard Model at accessible scales with controlled
corrections.

### [137] [Peierls instability for systems with several Fermi surfaces: an example from the chiral Gross-Neveu model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04212)
*Michael Thies*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses a multiple Peierls instability in a fermion system, solved using a chiral Gross-Neveu model with a twisted kink crystal mean field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of fermion systems with multiple instabilities is important in understanding complex quantum behaviors. This paper extends the Peierls instability concept to a more intricate setup.

Method: The approach uses a mean field theory with a 'twisted kink crystal' to model the system analytically.

Result: The system exhibits two distinct gaps, reflecting a double Peierls instability, which is an advancement in the understanding of fermion pairing under varying densities.

Conclusion: This work provides a concrete example of multiple Peierls instabilities, enhancing the theoretical framework for studying fermion pairing in non-homogeneous states.

Abstract: As is well known, the chiral Gross-Neveu model at finite density can be
solved semi-classically with the help of the chiral spiral mean field. The
fermion spectrum has a single gap right at the Fermi energy, a reflection of
the Peierls instability. Here, we divide the N fermion flavors up into two
subsets to which we attribute two different densities. The Hartree-Fock ground
state of such a system can again be found analytically, using as mean field the
``twisted kink crystal" of Basar and Dunne. Its spectrum displays two gaps with
lower edges coinciding with the two Fermi energies. This solution is favored
over the homogeneous one, providing us with an explicit example of a multiple
Peierls instability.

Abstract: We study the recent proposal of arXiv:2405.20366 which poses a precise
holographic duality between a 3d TQFT summed over all topologies and a unitary
ensemble of boundary 2d CFTs. In that proposal, the sum over topologies is
obtained via genus reduction from topologies with a large genus boundary
Riemann surface, while the boundary ensemble is given by all CFTs described by
Lagrangian condensations of the bulk TQFT. The main result of this work is to
show that each member of this ensemble is weighted by a symmetry factor given
by the invertible symmetry group of its categorical symmetry relative to the
bulk TQFT as its SymTFT. This is the natural $\unicode{x2014}$ uniform up to
isomorphism $\unicode{x2014}$ measure on the groupoid of Lagrangian algebras
that describe the boundary theories. We also write the sum over topologies more
explicitly in terms of equivalence classes of Heegaard splittings of
3-manifolds with a given boundary and comment on their weights. The holographic
duality in this framework can then be viewed as a generalization of the
Siegel-Weil formula. We discuss the implications of the main result for
non-compact TQFTs. In particular, for the Virasoro case, this implies an
ensemble of all CFTs at a given central charge in which CFTs are weighted by
their full invertible symmetry. Finally, we show how this TQFT gravity
framework gives a natural construction of the baby universe Hilbert space.

*Claudia Núñez,Miguel Pardina,Manuel Asorey,José Ignacio Latorre,Alba Cervera-Lierta*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: MaxEnt and minimal magic provide unique, gauge-invariant quantum interactions that are efficient for computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum complexity and its constraints in fundamental physics is key. The paper's aim is to explore if entanglement and magic jointly shape quantum interactions underpinning gauge and gravitational invariance.

Method: Numerical analysis of gluon-gluon and graviton-graviton scattering at tree level with altered quartic vertices to gauge and gravitational symmetry.

Result: Imposing maximal entanglement combined with minimal, non-zero magic uniquely identifies gauge-invariant and diffeomorphism-invariant interactions. These interactions are optimal for quantum computing, suggesting a unifying principle favoring MaxEnt and low magic in nature.

Conclusion: The findings imply that the interplay between maximal quantum correlations and constrained non-Clifford components drives the emergence of fundamental symmetries in nature, aligning with efficient quantum computational capabilities while maintaining classical simulability.

Abstract: Entanglement is a hallmark of quantum theory, yet it alone does not capture
the full extent of quantum complexity: some highly entangled states can still
be classically simulated. Non-classical behavior also requires magic, the
non-Clifford component that enables universal quantum computation. Here, we
investigate whether the interplay between entanglement and magic constrains the
structure of fundamental interactions. We study gluon-gluon and
graviton-graviton scattering at tree level, explicitly breaking gauge and
general covariance by modifying the quartic vertices and analyzing the
resulting generation of entanglement and magic. We find that imposing maximal
entanglement (MaxEnt) alone does not uniquely recover gauge-invariant and
diffeomorphism-invariant interactions, but adding the condition of minimal, but
nonzero, magic singles it out. Our results indicate that nature favors MaxEnt
and low magic: maximal quantum correlations with limited non-Cliffordness,
sufficient for universal quantum computing but close to classical simulability.
This dual informational principle may underlie the emergence of gauge
invariance in fundamental physics.

Abstract: A consistent implementation of the gravitational constraints in de Sitter
space requires gauging the full $SO(1,d)$ isometry group. In this paper, we
develop a framework that enables the gauging of the full de Sitter isometry
while consistently incorporating multiple observers on arbitrary geodesics. We
achieve this by introducing the concept of \textit{covariant observer}, whose
geodesic is a dynamical entity that transforms under the isometry group. Upon
quantization, the geodesic becomes a fluctuating degree of freedom, providing a
quantum reference frame for $SO(1,d)$. Inspired by the timelike tube theorem,
we propose that the algebra of observables is generated by all degrees of
freedom within the fluctuating static patch, including the quantum fields modes
and other observers. The gauge-invariant subalgebra of observables is an
averaged version of the modular crossed product algebra, and we establish its
type II character by constructing a trace. This yields a well-defined von
Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, by imposing a UV cutoff in QFT and
proposing a quantum generalization of the first law, we demonstrate that the
algebraic and generalized entropies are in match.
  Our work generalizes the notion of a local algebra to that of a
\textit{fluctuating region}, representing an average of algebras over all
possible static patches and configurations of other geodesics. This provides a
complete, covariant, and multi-observer extension of the CLPW construction and
lays the foundation for a fully relational quantum gravitational description of
de Sitter space.

Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of
supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1
supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with
emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second
part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in
a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and
their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations
and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is
closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional
non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly
realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional
Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most
symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve
internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua
and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing
some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of
inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1
supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes,
and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric
string vacua.

Abstract: According to the flat/CCFT correspondence, Carrollian conformal field
theories (CCFT) in d dimensions are dual to asymptotically flat spacetimes in
d+1 dimensions. In this paper, starting from the holographic interpretation of
pseudo-entropy in the (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we show that both extremal spacelike
and timelike curves possess a well-defined flat-space limit. The length of
these curves can be regarded as the real and imaginary parts of the
pseudo-entropy for the underlying field theory, where only the real part has
been considered thus far. Our calculations can confirm that the entanglement
entropy in the CCFTs is fundamentally pseudo-entropy, and these theories are
non-unitary.

Abstract: We present a family of exact neutral hairy black-hole solutions with
spherical horizon topology in extended supergravity with Fayet--Iliopoulos
terms. We consider a consistent dilaton truncation and analyze in detail a
sector where the magnetic part of the FI terms vanishes. Using appropriate
dilaton counterterms, we compute the thermodynamic quantities and show the
existence of Hawking--Page phase transitions. As a holographic application, we
derive the thermal superpotential in closed form and use it as a counterterm,
explicitly demonstrating that no additional finite counterterms are required to
regularize the Euclidean action and the quasi-local stress tensor. The dual
stress tensor matches that of a thermal gas of massless particles and is
consistent with mixed dilaton boundary conditions that preserve conformal
symmetry.

Abstract: We investigate Cauchy Slice Holography in de Sitter spacetime. By performing
a $T^2$ deformation of a (bottom-up) dS/CFT model, we obtain a holographic
theory living on flat Cauchy slices of de Sitter, for which time is an emergent
dimension, associated with an RG flow. In this $T^2$-deformed field theory, the
dS/CFT is an IR fixed point rather than a UV fixed point, potentially affecting
discussions of naturalness. As in the case of AdS/CFT, the terms in the $T^2$
deformation depend on the dimension and the bulk matter sector; in this article
we consider gravity, plus optionally a scalar field of arbitrary mass. We
compute scalar and graviton two-point correlation functions in the deformed
boundary theory, and demonstrate precise agreement with finite-time
wavefunction coefficients, which we calculate independently on the bulk side.
The results are analytic in the scalar field dimension $\Delta$, and may
therefore be continued to arbitrary generic values, including the principal
series. Although many aspects of the calculations are similar to the AdS/CFT
case, some new features arise due to the complex phases which appear in
cosmology. Our calculations confirm previous expectations that the holographic
counterterms are purely imaginary, when expressed in terms of wavefunction
coefficients. But cosmological correlators, calculated by the Born rule, are
shifted in a more complicated and nonlinear way.

Abstract: Building on the work of Gang, Kang, and Kim arXiv:2405.16377, we propose 3D
bulk dual field theories for 2D $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric minimal models
$SM(P, Q)$ and $W_{N}$ algebra minimal models $W_{N}(P, Q)$. We associate to
$SM(P, Q)$ a Seifert fibered space $S^2((P,P-R),(Q,S),(3,1))$ with $PS-QR=2$,
and for $W_{N}(P, Q)$ a Seifert fibered space
$S^2((P,P{-}R),(Q,S),(N{+}1,-2N{-}1))$ with $PS-QR=1$, and realize the bulk
theory via the 3D-3D correspondence. For the unitary series, the bulk theory
flows in the IR to a gapped phase which, under suitable boundary conditions,
supports the unitary chiral minimal model on the boundary. For the non-unitary
series, the bulk theory flows to the 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field
theory whose topological twist yields a non-unitary topological field theory
supporting the non-unitary chiral minimal model on the boundary under
appropriate boundary conditions. We also propose UV gauge theory descriptions
of the bulk theories obtained by gluing $T[SU(n)]$ building blocks. For $SM(P,
Q)$, we provide non-trivial consistency checks -- matching between various bulk
partition functions and boundary conformal data -- while for $W_N(P, Q)$, we
present preliminary checks and leave further consistency checks for future
work.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a
massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper
acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field
operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right
Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both
these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of
the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one
presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and
the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the
boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free
geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the
Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the
boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion
condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative
everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and
the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region.
For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions
$D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero.
This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the
geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter
case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of
the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.

Abstract: We study the vacuum expectation value of half-BPS Wilson loop operators in
two families of superconformal $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories.
The first family is dual to AdS$_{4}$ solutions in M-theory, while the second
one has a dual description in massive type IIA string theory. Utilizing the
properties of the underlying geometry, we provide a universal description for
the semiclassical quantization of a probe M2-brane and fundamental string in
the respective holographic dual geometries. As a result, we find the one-loop
partition function of both the M2-brane and the string which leads to a
prediction for the large $N$ behaviour of the Wilson loops in the dual SCFTs.
For theories with M-theory duals, we conjecture the full perturbative
completion as a ratio of Airy functions.

Abstract: The amplitude of resonant oscillations in a non-Hermitian environment can
either decay or grow in time, corresponding to a mode with either loss or gain.
When two coupled modes have a specific difference between their loss or gain, a
feature termed an exceptional point emerges in the excitations' energy
manifold, at which both the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the system
coalesce. Exceptional points have intriguing effects on the dynamics of systems
due to their topological properties. They have been explored in contexts
including optical, microwave, optomechanical, electronic and magnonic systems,
and have been used to control systems including optical microcavities, the
lasing modes of a PT-symmetric waveguide, and terahertz pulse generation. A
challenging problem that remains open in all of these scenarios is the fully
deterministic and direct manipulation of the systems' loss and gain on
timescales relevant to coherent control of excitations. Here we demonstrate the
rapid manipulation of the gain and loss balance of excitations of a magnonic
hybrid system on durations much shorter than their decay rate, allowing us to
exploit non-Hermitian physics for coherent control. By encircling an
exceptional point, we demonstrate population transfer between coupled
magnon-polariton modes, and confirm the distinctive chiral nature of
exceptional point encircling. We then study the effect of driving the system
directly through an exceptional point, and demonstrate that this allows the
coupled system to be prepared in an equal superposition of eigenmodes. We also
show that the dynamics of the system at the exceptional point are dependent on
its generalised eigenvectors. These results extend the established toolbox of
adiabatic transfer techniques with a new approach for coherent state
preparation, and provide a new avenue for exploring the dynamical properties of
non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: Current interstitial techniques of tumor ablation face challenges that
ultrasound technologies could meet. The ablation radius and directionality of
the ultrasound beam could improve the efficiency and precision. Here, a 9gauge
MR-compatible dual-mode ultrasound catheter prototype was experimentally
evaluated for Ultrasound Imageguided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound
(USgHIFU) conformal ablations. The prototype consisted of 64 piezocomposite
linear array elements and was driven by an open research programmable dual-mode
ultrasound platform. After verifying the US-image guidance capabilities of the
prototype, the HIFU output performances (dynamic focusing and HIFU intensities)
were quantitatively characterized, together with the associated 3D HIFU-induced
thermal heating in tissue phantoms (using MR thermometry). Finally, the ability
to produce robustly HIFU-induced thermal ablations in in-vitro liver was
studied experimentally and compared to numerical modeling. Investigations of
several HIFU dynamic focusing allowed overcoming the challenges of
miniaturizing the device: mono-focal focusing maximized deep energy deposition,
while multi-focal strategies eliminated grating lobes. The linear-array design
of the prototype made it possible to produce interstitial ultrasound images of
tissue and tumor mimics in situ. Multi-focal pressure fields were generated
without grating lobes and transducer surface intensities reached up to Isapa
=14 W$\bullet$cm -2 . Seventeen elementary thermal ablations were performed in
vitro. Rotation of the catheter proved the directionality of ablation, sparing
non-targeted tissue. This experimental proof of concept demonstrates the
feasibility of treating volumes comparable to those of primary solid tumors
with a miniaturized USgHIFU catheter whose dimensions are close to those of
tools traditionally used in interventional radiology, while offering new
functionalities.

Abstract: Real-time and accurate monitoring of humidity and pH is of great significance
in daily life and industrial production. Existing humidity and pH measurement
suffer from limitations such as low sensitivity, signal crosstalk, complex
system structures, and inability to achieve real-time monitoring. In this work,
the surface of a polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) was functionalized with a
composite humidity-sensitive polymer composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and
carbon nanosheets (CNs). A humidity-sensitive film with a microporous structure
was prepared on the PMF cladding through high-temperature rapid film formation
and laser processing, enhancing humidity sensitivity and stability. To enable
pH sensing, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA)
were successively adsorbed onto the PMF surface via electrostatic
self-assembly, forming a pH-sensitive nanofilm structure. By connecting a
temperature-compensated PMF within the same Sagnac loop and combining it with a
multi-wavelength matrix, simultaneous real-time monitoring of humidity, pH, and
temperature was achieved, effectively solving the issue of temperature
crosstalk and extending toward a universal optical fiber multi-parameter
measurement platform.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D打印技术的广泛应用，材料的频率依赖性及其阻尼特性在工程设计中变得至关重要。

Method: 研究采用状态前沿模型和受约束粒子群优化算法，结合激光 Doppler 振动仪的数据，对频率响应函数进行拟合。

Result: 实验结果验证了该方法的有效性，成功识别了 POM 和 F cannia 材料的参数，并量化了参数的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种实用的材料识别方法，克服了实验数据中的边界条件和噪声等挑战。

Abstract: 3D-printed materials are used in many different industries (automotive,
aviation, medicine, etc.). Most of these 3D-printed materials are based on
ceramics or polymers whose mechanical properties vary with frequency. For
numerical modeling, it is crucial to characterize this frequency dependency
accurately to enable realistic finite-element simulations. At the same time,
the damping behavior plays a key role in product development, since it governs
a component's response at resonance and thus impacts both performance and
longevity. In current research, inverse material characterization methods are
getting more and more popular. However, their practical validation and
applicability on real measurement data have not yet been discussed widely. In
this work, we show the identification of two different materials, POM and
additively manufactured sintered ceramics, and validate it with experimental
data of a well-established measurement technique (dynamic mechanical analysis).
The material identification process considers state-of-the-art reduced-order
modeling and constrained particle swarm optimization, which are used to fit the
frequency response functions of point measurements obtained by a laser Doppler
vibrometer. This work shows the quality of the method in identifying the
parameters defining the viscoelastic fractional derivative model, including
their uncertainty. It also illustrates the applicability of this identification
method in the presence of practical difficulties that come along with
experimental data such as boundary conditions and noise.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an ultracompact, high-sensitive trace-gas sensor using photoacoustic spectroscopy and feedback interferometry, which achieves similar performance to bulkier interferometric schemes while reducing size and enhancing detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing small, efficient, and high-sensitive sensors for in situ applications is crucial for medical diagnostics, security, and environmental control. This paper addresses the challenge by introducing an innovative sensor design.

Method: The sensor combines photoacoustic spectroscopy with feedback interferometry using a self-mixing readout mechanism. This method allows for compact size, low baseline, and improved detectability.

Result: The proposed sensor achieves comparable sensitivity and improved detection limits over existing methods while maintaining signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It also exhibits wavelength independence, making it adaptable to various spectral ranges.

Conclusion: The presented sensor offers a promising solution for small-footprint gas sensing with high sensitivity and versatility across applications.

Abstract: Versatile, ultracompact, easy-to-handle, high-sensitivity sensors are
compelling tools for in situ pivotal applications, such as medical diagnostics,
security and safety assessments, and environmental control. In this work, we
combine photoacoustic spectroscopy and feedback interferometry, proposing a
novel trace-gas sensor equipped with a self-mixing readout. This scheme
demonstrates a readout sensitivity comparable to that of bulkier
state-of-the-art balanced Michelson-interferometric schemes, achieving the same
spectroscopic performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and minimum
detection limit (MDL). At the same time, the self-mixing readout benefits from
a reduced size and a lower baseline, paving the way for future system
downsizing and integration while offering a higher detectability for lower gas
concentrations. Moreover, the intrinsic wavelength independence of both
self-mixing and photoacoustic techniques allows the applicability and
tailorability of the sensor to any desired spectral range.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the physical design and systematic optimization of a
high-performance storage ring tailored for the generation of high-power
coherent radiation, with particular emphasis on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
regime. The proposed ring adopts a Double Bend Achromat (DBA) lattice
configuration and integrates 12 superconducting wigglers to significantly
enhance radiation damping and minimize the natural emittance. And a bypass line
is adopted to generate high power coherent radiation. Comprehensive linear and
nonlinear beam dynamics analyses have been conducted to ensure beam stability
and robustness across the operational parameter space. The optimized design
achieves a natural emittance of approximately 0.8 nm and a longitudinal damping
time of around 1.4 ms, enabling the efficient buildup of coherent radiation.
Three-dimensional numerical simulations, incorporating the previously proposed
angular dispersion-induced microbunching (ADM) mechanism, further confirm the
system's capability to generate high-power EUV coherent radiation, with output
powers reaching the order of several hundred watts. These results underscore
the strong potential of the proposed design for applications in coherent photon
science and EUV lithography.

Result: 实施该方法可以减少噪声对探测的影响，增强引力波天文学Overall灵敏度。

Conclusion: 该方法可以显著提高引力波观测仪的稳健性与灵敏度。

Abstract: Disturbances in gravitational wave (GW) observational data are often caused
by non-stationary noise in the detector itself, such as back-scattering of
laser stray light into the signal field. Unlike GW signals, non-stationary
noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal
quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this
orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to
reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of
non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that
is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to
simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We
demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise
caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity
and robustness of GW observatories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting DSNB neutrinos is crucial for astrophysics and neutrino physics. Neutron tagging is the key method.

Method: Added gadolinium sulfate to improve neutron detection by leveraging its large capture cross section.

Result: Increased sensitivity and background reduction, with world-leading DSNB flux limits achieved.

Conclusion: SK-Gd upgrade advances DSNB detection, opens new opportunities, and pushes theoretical modeling forward.

Abstract: Super-Kamiokande [SK] was upgraded through the addition of gadolinium sulfate
to its ultrapure water, initiating the SK-Gd program. This development enables
efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium,
greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary
channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The
upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as
well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability,
extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the
EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of
radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and
uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated
high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits
on the DSNB flux. With these advances, SK-Gd now stands at the threshold of
discovering the DSNB and opens a wide range of new opportunities in
astrophysics and neutrino physics.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: A novel counting method, BPC, for direct electron detectors in electron microscopy is developed which outperforms traditional methods in high electron fluence situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for high-resolution electron microscopy and the need to directly assess materials at high electron flux levels drive the development of this method.

Method: BPC utilizes machine learning techniques for large tensor operations without requiring extensive training datasets.

Result: BPC effectively counts multiple electrons per pixel and is robust to high electron occupancy, demonstrating better performance in synthetic and experimental data.

Conclusion: BPC represents a significant advancement in electron counting for electron microscopy, particularly beneficial for applications like in situ TEM.

Abstract: Electron microscopy (EM) is a foundational tool for directly assessing the
structure of materials. Recent advances in direct electron detectors have
improved signal-to noise ratios via single-electron counting. However,
accurately counting electrons at high fluence remains challenging. We developed
a new method of electron counting for direct electron detectors,
Back-Propagation Counting (BPC). BPC uses machine learning techniques designed
for mathematical operations on large tensors but does not require large
training datasets. In synthetic data, we show BPC is able to count multiple
electron strikes per pixel and is robust to increasing occupancy. In
experimental data, frames counted with BPC are shown to reconstruct diffraction
peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with relatively higher
intensity and produce images with improved contrast when compared to a standard
counting method. Together, these results show that BPC excels in experiments
where pixels see a high flux of electron irradiation such as in situ TEM movies
and diffraction.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We report on R&D study to improve the photon detection efficiency of water
Cherenkov detectors by doping ultra-pure water with 4-methylumbelliferone
(4-MU), a wavelength shifting additive. Cherenkov light yields from cosmic-ray
muons were measured for various 4-MU concentrations and compared with those
from pure water. At a concentration of 1 ppm, the detected light yield
increased by approximately a factor of three. This enhancement can be
attributed to wavelength shifting and improved photon collection efficiency. No
noticeable degradation in optical transparency was observed across the tested
concentrations of 0.5 and 1 ppm with different concentration of ethanol. These
results suggest that 4-MU is a promising additive for improving the performance
of water Cherenkov detectors.

Abstract: Homodyne Quadrature interferometers (HoQI) are an interferometric
displacement sensing scheme proven to have excellent noise performance, making
them a strong candidate for sensing and control schemes in gravitational wave
detector seismic isolation. Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone
to nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if
left unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper
first shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working
HoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time
correction of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately
calibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one
of the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational
wave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs,
suppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal
of such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be
reconstructed after the fact. We demonstrate all of this on a working HoQI
system and show the measured suppression of nonlinear effects from each of
these methods. Our work makes HoQIs a more broadly applicable tool for
displacement sensing.

Method: 利用顺序统计方法分析相关事件的到达时间分布，扩展crosstalk模型以包含afterpulsing事件，从种子电荷流出发进行分析。

Result: 发现随着种子数量的增加，首次到达时间的分布变得更加集中，反映了更可能的相互关联性。

Conclusion: 该方法为提取延迟crosstalk和afterpulsing事件的时间信息提供了有效的工具，并预测在种子数量增加的情况下，首次到达时间的概率更高。

Abstract: This paper briefly presents an order statistic approach to the time
distribution of the first detected event after a primary avalanche breakdown
from a mixture of correlated and dark counting processes. The well-known order
statistic method, commonly used to describe the time resolution of
scintillation detectors, is applied to the arrival times of correlated events.
The established model of crosstalk as a branching Poisson process is extended
to afterpulsing, and correlated events are considered starting from their seeds
-- free (de-trapped or diffused) charge carriers capable of triggering
secondary avalanche breakdowns. The proposed approach enables the extraction of
timing information for delayed crosstalk and afterpulsing events mixed with
dark counts and predicts that the distribution of the first arrival time
narrows as the number of seeds increases, corresponding to a higher probability
of correlated events.
