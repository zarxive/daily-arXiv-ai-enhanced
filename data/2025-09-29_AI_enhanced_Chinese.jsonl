This implies that even in the absence of rotations or for moderate\nrotations frequencies, LLL states are present as excited states at finite\nangular momentum. For fermions with contact interactions, these states are\nexact eigenstates of a paradigmatic model of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH)\nstates described by a single Haldane pseudopotential ($V_1$ for spin-polarized\nand $V_0$ for spinful systems), which realizes exact Laughlin and Haldane wave\nfunctions.

Six-hourly simulated noisy\nobservations are generated for a 30-year ML training period and a one-year\ntesting period. These observations are assimilated with a Local Ensemble\nTransform Kalman Filter (LETKF), and a 10-day deterministic forecast is also\nstarted from each ensemble mean analysis of the testing period. In the first\nexperiment, the physics-based model provides the background ensemble members\nand the 10-day deterministic forecasts. In the other three experiments, the\nhybrid model plays the same role as the physics-based model in the first\nexperiment, but it is trained on a different data set in each experiment. These\ntraining data sets are analyses obtained by using the physics-based model\n(second experiment), the hybrid model of the previous experiment (third\nexperiment), and for comparison, ERA5 reanalyses (fourth experiment). The\nresults of the experiments show that hybridizing the model can substantially\nimprove the accuracy of the analyses and forecasts.

The chirality-induced spin selectivity\n(CISS) effect, where chiral materials preferentially transmit electrons of a\nparticular spin, has sparked intense interest and debate regarding its\nunderlying mechanism. Despite extensive research, the spatial distribution of\nspin polarization in chiral systems, the key evidence to reveal the spin\nscattering mechanism in CISS, has remained experimentally elusive particularly\ndue to complications arising from spin-orbit coupling in metal electrodes\ntypically used in such studies. Here we show, through reflective magnetic\ncircular dichroism measurements on chiral tellurium nanowires with graphene\nelectrodes, that current-induced spin polarization exhibits identical signs in\nboth the nanowire and electrodes, distinct from the presumed spin filter\nscenario. The observed spin polarization scales linearly with current\namplitude, aligns parallel to the current direction, reverses with chirality or\ncurrent flow, and demonstrates spin relaxation lengths of several micrometers\ninto graphene.

HBARs demonstrate several very sharp\nresonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency\nrange. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses\nsignificant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models\nthe unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate\n(a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and\ncritically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which\nimparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use\nof fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and\nsets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical\ndevice, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband\ndatasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously\nfitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1\nGHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling\ncoefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by\nleveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be\neasily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes,\nmultiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting\nmeasured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various\nperturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be\nuseful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and\nsensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins\nhave been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory\nrequirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately\nsimulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly\naccounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with\nadditional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product\nstate (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we\nmitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically\nencountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power\nof these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair\nsystems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple\nradical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely\ncapture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence\nof the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product\nyield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the\nnuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in\nspin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception\nmechanisms.

These\namorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic\nplasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking\ncentrosymmetry.

The efficiency of these devices is strongly dependent on\nthe interaction length between the light and the nonlinear material, scaling\nquadratically with this parameter. Nevertheless, the fabrication of long,\ncontinuously poled areas in TFLN remains challenging, the length of\ncontinuously poled areas rarely exceeds 10 mm. In this work, we demonstrate a\nsignificant progress in this field achieving the periodic poling of continuous\npoled areas of 70 mm length with a 3 microns poling period and a close to 50 %\nduty cycle. We compare two poling electrode design approaches to fabricate\nlong, continuous poled areas. The first approach involves the poling of a\nsingle, continuous 70 mm long electrode. The second utilize a segmented\napproach including the poling of more than 20 individual sections forming\ntogether a 70 mm long poling area with no stitching errors. While the\ncontinuous electrode allows for faster fabrication, the segmented approach\nallows to individually optimize the poling resulting in less duty cycle\nvariation. A detailed analysis of the periodic poling results reveals that the\nresults of both are consistent with previously reported poling outcomes for\nshorter devices.

The 1D and 3D reference interaction site\nmodels (1D- and 3D-RISM) of molecular solvation, as implemented in the\nAmberTools molecular modeling suite, are well suited for modeling mixtures of\nionic species around biomolecules across a wide range of concentrations.\nHowever, the available ion model parameters were optimized for molecular\ndynamics simulations, not for the RISM framework, which includes a closure\napproximation. To address this, we optimized the Lennard-Jones 12-6 model for\nmonovalent ions for 1D-RISM with the partial series expansion of order 3\nclosure by fitting to experimental values of ion-oxygen distance (IOD),\nhydration free energy (HFE), partial molar volume (PMV) and mean activity\ncoefficient. The new parameter set demonstrated significant improvement in HFE,\nIOD, and mean activity coefficients, whereas no overall change was observed for\nthe PMV. A second optimization step was necessary to account for the\ncation-anion interactions that affect the mean activity coefficients. The new\nparameters were validated at finite salt concentrations against experimental\ndata for 16 ion pairs and showed improved accuracy for 14 of them, while the\nresults for CsI and CsF were the second best. 1D-RISM results obtained with the\nnew NaCl parameters were used to calculate the preferential interaction\nparameter of the ions around the 24L B-DNA using 3D-RISM.

Our results show that including Mulliken\ncharges with a small weight in the loss function yields up to a 30% improvement\nin dipole prediction accuracy. This multitask approach enables the model to\nlearn a more physically grounded representation of charge distributions,\nthereby improving both the accuracy and consistency of dipole magnitude\npredictions. These findings highlight that even auxiliary data of limited\nquantitative reliability can provide valuable qualitative physical insights,\nultimately strengthening the predictive power of machine learning models for\nmolecular properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff1a\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u77e9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u77e9\u548c\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684\u6469\u5c14\u6839\u7535\u8377\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6469\u5c14\u6839\u7535\u8377\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u4ee5\u8f83\u5c0f\u6743\u91cd\u52a0\u5165\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u5076\u77e9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe30%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u66f4\u8d28\u6734\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u8d28\u6734\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u77e9\u548c\u6469\u5c14\u6839\u7535\u8377\u3002\u6469\u5c14\u6839\u7535\u8377\u88ab\u9009\u4e3a\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6469\u5c14\u6839\u7535\u8377\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u5076\u77e9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u8f83\u5f31\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6469\u5c14\u6839\u7535\u8377\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6240\u542b\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper we study the potential of\nusing reinforcement learning (RL) in order to synthesize quantum circuits,\nwhile optimizing the T-count and CS-count, of unitaries that are exactly\nimplementable by the Clifford+T and Clifford+CS gate sets, respectively. In\ngeneral, the complexity of existing algorithms depend exponentially on the\nnumber of qubits and the non-Clifford-count of unitaries. We have designed our\nRL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us\nto perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also\nincorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order\nto reduce the search complexity.

An entangled state is a nonlocal superposition of\nrealities that belong to a physical system. The common test of such a state has\nbeen done through Bell measurements. In this work, we attempt to look at this\nnotion from a different perspective. We study the evolution of the orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertia reference frames under a Lorentz\nboost. We consider two specific motions for the observers of the entanglement.\nFirst, we consider observers with zero relative motion (Zero-RM). Second, we\nchoose to have a non-zero relative motion (Non-Zero RM) for them. In the second\ncase, we distinguish between observer's perspective of the amplitude\nprobability from the perspective of rest (Non-Zero RM1) and moving (Non-Zero\nRM2) observers. As a result, the transition probability amplitudes are altered.\nWe observe that entanglement undergoes significant changes and is not preserved\nmaximally from the viewpoint of the stationary observers at the rest frame and\nasymptotically approaches a minimum close to the light cone (LC). However, from\nthe viewpoint of moving observer in the Non-Zero RM2, entanglement will not\nsurvive, and the final state is separable. This is an extremely important\nobservation since the concept of entanglement is supposed to be non-local, and\ntherefore free from any spacetime transformation. Our results demonstrated\nthrough the entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity show\nthat an entangled state is not non-local and hence the so-called collapse of\nthe wavefunction in quantum mechanics does not occur spontaneously in\nspacetime.

A\ntextbook example is the estimation of a classical field's amplitude using a\ntwo-level probe, as described by the semi-classical Rabi model. In this work,\nwe explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent\nquantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom. For\nboth metrological scenarios, we focus on the quantum Fisher information (QFI)\nof the reduced state of the atomic probe. In the semi-classical Rabi model, the\nQFI is independent of the field amplitude and grows quadratically with the\ninteraction time $\\tau$. In contrast, when the atom interacts with a single\ncoherent mode of the field, the QFI is bounded by 4, a constant dictated by the\nnon-orthogonality of coherent states. We find that this bound can only be\napproached in the vacuum limit. In the limit of large amplitude $\\alpha$, the\nQFI is found to attain its maximal value $1.47$ at $\\tau =O(1)$ and $\\tau\n=O(\\alpha^2)$, and also shows periodic revivals at much later times. When the\natom interacts with a sequence of coherent states, the QFI can increase with\ntime but is bounded to scale linearly due to the production of entanglement\nbetween the atom and the radiation (back-action), except in the limit where the\nnumber of modes and their total energy diverge. Finally, in the continuous\nlimit, where the atom interacts with many weak coherent states, this\nback-action can be simply interpreted as spontaneous emission, giving rise to\nthe optimal interaction time and QFI rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

As\nsuch, understanding the properties of dynamical systems is of great importance.\nTypically, a dynamical system is described by a system of ordinary differential\nequations (ODE). Most ODEs do not admit analytical solutions, which makes\ndynamical systems challenging to understand. In this work, we introduce a\nquantum framework for determining certain properties of dynamical systems. We\ncombine many recent advances in quantum algorithms, particularly quantum ODE\nsolver and quantum topological data analysis. Leveraging the prior results\nregarding the quantum ODE solvers, we use the output of these quantum\nalgorithms as a means to build the graph associated with the trajectory of the\ndynamical system in the phase space.
