TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多方法分析框架来分析光子计数时间序列，用于区分生物驱动的相关性和随机或仪器效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们希望通过多方法框架可靠地区分生物驱动的相关性和随机或仪器效应，以帮助理解生物系统的自组织和非平衡统计物理。

Method: 研究采用了多个方法，包括分布熵分析、Rényi熵、detrended波动分析，其推广形式广义多重分形detrended波动分析，以及尾部统计学描述，结合泊松过程、分形高斯噪声和更新过程（具有幂律等待时间）构造的混杂信号作为对照。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了多分辨率分析方法，可靠地区分平凡的 photon计数统计和结构化的长期组织，为未来生物UPE测量及其在非平衡统计物理和信息动力学中的解释提供了验证的方法学基础。

Abstract: Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) from living systems is widely hypothesized to reflect un-derlying self-organization and long-range coordination in biological dynamics. However, distin-guishing biologically driven correlations from trivial stochastic or instrumental effects requires a robust, multi-method framework. In this work, we establish and benchmark a comprehensive anal-ysis pipeline for photon-count time series, combining Distribution Entropy Analysis, Rényi entro-py, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, its generalization Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and tail-statistics characterization. Surrogate signals constructed from Poisson processes, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and Renewal Processes with power-law waiting times are used to validate sensitivity to memory, intermittency, and multifractality. Across all methods, a coherent hierarchy of dynamical regimes is recovered, demonstrating internal methodological consistency. Application to experimental dark-count data and attenuated coherent-laser emission confirm Poisson-like behavior, establishing an essential statistical baseline for UPE studies. The combined results show that this multi-resolution approach reliably separates trivial photon-counting statistics from struc-tured long-range organization, providing a validated methodological foundation for future biological UPE measurements and their interpretation in the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, information dynamics, and prospective markers of biological coherence.

### [2] [Enhanced sensitivity to variations of fundamental constants in highly charged molecules from analytic perturbation theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10791)
*Carsten Zülch,Konstantin Gaul,Robert Berger*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: 研究通过分析原子和分子中的过渡态，提出了一种新方法来评估基本常数的时间变异敏感性，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基本常数如精细结构常数是否在时间上保持恒定是物理学中的关键问题，提高检测其变异的方法有助于验证物理理论。

Method: 研究者开发了一种基于Dirac-CoulombHamiltonian的一阶扰动方法，计算了对光变常数和电子-质子质量比的敏感性，该方法适用于大多数量子化学软件。

Result: 该方法在高精度分子光谱（如PaF³⁺和CeF²⁺中的分立过渡态）中表现出对该基本常数的高敏感性，尤其是在光变常数和质量比方面。

Conclusion: 这种方法为评估基本常数的时间变异提供了高效且通用的工具，特别是在分子光谱研究中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Quasi-forbidden electronic transitions in atoms and quasi-degenerate vibronic transitions in molecules serve as powerful probes of hypothetical temporal variations of fundamental constants. Computation of the sensitivity of a transition to a variation of the fine-structure constant is conventionally performed by numerical variation of the speed of light in sophisticated electronic structure calculations, and therewith several individual calculations have to be performed. An approach is presented herein that obtains sensitivity coefficients as first order perturbation to the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian and allows their computation as expectation values of the relativistic kinetic energy and rest-mass operators. These are available in essentially all \emph{ab initio} relativistic electronic structure codes. Additionally, the corresponding operators for two-component Hamiltonians are derived, explicitly for the zeroth order regular approximation Hamiltonian. The approach is applied to demonstrate great sensitivity of highly charged polar molecules that were recently proposed for high-precision spectroscopy in [Zülch \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2203.10333[physics.chem-ph]]. In particular, a high sensitivity of a wealth of quasi-degenerate vibronic transitions in PaF$^{3+}$ and CeF$^{2+}$ to temporal variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron-proton mass ratio is shown.

Result: 计算了碰撞能量在钠(4f)能级以下的高偏振数共振，识别出一些具有争议性质的共振态，通过相位变化研究和交叉截面中的结构、稳定性图中的特征模式证实了这些共振的存在。计算得到的电荷偶极共振模式与最新的复归一化计算结果吻合良好。发现了一个来自钠(4d)和钠(4f)能级近退化性的电荷偶极准共振序列，这些准共振态按几何方式累积接近钠(4d)能级。

Conclusion: 该研究为高能物理和原子物理领域提供了新的见解，为未来的实验和理论研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate resonances in positron-sodium scattering using the $R$-matrix propagation method formulated in hyperspherical coordinates. The interaction between the sodium core and the valence electron is described by analytical model potentials. High partial-wave resonances are calculated for collision energies up to the Na($4f$) threshold. Several resonant states of debated character are identified, and their behavior is analyzed through phase-variation studies, the associated structures in the calculated cross sections, and the characteristic patterns observed in the stability plots. The calculated dipole series of resonances, supported by the ion-dipole interaction between Na$^{\scriptscriptstyle+}$ and Ps($n=2$), shows good agreement with recent complex-scaling calculations. In addition, a sequence of quasi-dipole resonances is found to arise from the near degeneracy of the Na($4d$) and Na($4f$) states in the e$^{+}$-Na system, which accumulate geometrically toward the Na($4d$) threshold.

### [5] [SCULPT: An Interactive Machine Learning Platform for Analyzing Multi-Particle Coincidence Data from Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11153)
*Hazem Daoud,Sarvesh Kumar,Jin Qian,Daniel Slaughter,Tanny Chavez,Thorsten Weber*

Main category: physics.atm-clus

TL;DR: SCULPT is a software platform for analyzing high-dimensional data from COLTRIMS experiments, using UMAP and other techniques for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. It provides visualization, confidence scoring, and a modular architecture for efficient analysis of multi-particle coincidence data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the development of SCULPT is to address the challenges in analyzing complex, high-dimensional data from modern momentum spectroscopy experiments, particularly in the field of cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS). With the increasing complexity of experimental data, traditional analysis methods are becoming inadequate, necessitating the development of advanced computational tools to extract meaningful insights and correlations from the data.

Method: SCULPT employs a combination of advanced machine learning techniques and physics-informed analysis. The primary method used for dimensionality reduction is Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Additionally, the platform explores the potential of deep autoencoders for feature learning and genetic programming for automated discovery of physically meaningful observables. The software also incorporates an adaptive confidence scoring system, which evaluates user-selected clustering quality metrics with predefined weights based on the metrics' robustness.

Result: The application of SCULPT to photo double ionization data of the D2O molecule revealed distinct fragmentation channels and their correlations with specific physics parameters. This finding not only demonstrates the effectiveness of the software in analyzing complex data but also highlights its potential for identifying rare events with non-linear correlations during experimental measurements, thereby improving the efficiency and adaptability of downstream experiments.

Conclusion: SCULPT represents a significant advancement in the computational analysis of high-dimensional data from COLTRIMS experiments. By integrating machine learning with physics-informed methods, SCULPT provides researchers with a powerful tool to visualize, interpret, and analyze complex experimental data, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their research efforts.

Abstract: We present SCULPT (Supervised Clustering and Uncovering Latent Patterns with Training), a comprehensive software platform for analyzing tabulated high-dimensional multi-particle coincidence data from Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) experiments. The software addresses critical challenges in modern momentum spectroscopy by integrating advanced machine learning techniques with physics-informed analysis in an interactive web-based environment. SCULPT implements Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for non-linear dimensionality reduction to reveal correlations in highly dimensional data. We also discuss potential extensions to deep autoencoders for feature learning, and genetic programming for automated discovery of physically meaningful observables. A novel adaptive confidence scoring system provides quantitative reliability assessments by evaluating user-selected clustering quality metrics with predefined weights that reflect each metric's robustness. The platform features configurable molecular profiles for different experimental systems, interactive visualization with selection tools, and comprehensive data filtering capabilities. Utilizing a subset of SCULPT's capabilities, we analyze photo double ionization data measured using the COLTRIMS method for 3-body dissociation of the D2O molecule, revealing distinct fragmentation channels and their correlations with physics parameters. The software's modular architecture and web-based implementation make it accessible to the broader atomic and molecular physics community, significantly reducing the time required for complex multi-dimensional analyses. This opens the door to finding and isolating rare events exhibiting non-linear correlations on the fly during experimental measurements, which can help steer exploration and improve the efficiency of experiments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) with the full-update strategy. Simulating directly in the thermodynamic limit, we explore the relaxation process near the critical point with two types of initial states: a fully polarized state and a product state with a small magnetization. For the fully polarized state, the magnetization shows a power law scaling $M\propto τ^{-β/(νz)}$ in the imaginary-time evolution, from which both the critical point and critical exponent can be determined with high accuracy. For the nearly paramagnetic state, the relaxation process exhibits a behavior of $M\propto τ^θ$ with $θ=0.1958$ being the critical initial-slip exponent, which is in good agreement with that obtained from the dynamic scaling of the self-correlation in quantum Monte Carlo method. These universal features emerge well before the system converges to the ground state, demonstrating the efficiency of imaginary-time evolution for probing quantum criticality. Our results demonstrate that iPEPS can serve as a robust and scalable method for studying dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for controlling Higgs mode and vortex dynamics in superconductors using structured light. We propose a phenomenon analog of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in superconductors, where Higgs waves scatter off light-induced vortex lattices, generating interference patterns akin to matter wave diffraction. We also find that the vortices enable the linear coupling of Higgs mode to the electromagnetic field. This interplay between light-engineered Higgs excitations and emergent vortex textures opens a pathway to probe nonequilibrium superconductivity with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Our results bridge quantum optics and condensed matter physics, offering new examples of quantum printing where one uses structured light to manipulate the collective modes in correlated quantum fluids.

Motivation: The research likely aims to deepen the understanding of the electronic and optical properties of TaNiTe5, a layered topological semimetal, possibly contributing to the field of condensed matter physics and materials science.

Method: Infrared spectroscopy, optical conductivity measurements, and ab initio calculations are employed to analyze the electronic and optical responses of TaNiTe5 along different crystallographic axes.

Result: The study reveals that TaNiTe5 exhibits metallic behavior along both the a and c axes, with significant anisotropy in its optical conductivity. Additionally, ab initio calculations corroborate the experimental data, confirming the material's three-dimensional electronic structure.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that TaNiTe5 behaves as a three-dimensional anisotropic semimetal, which is a crucial step toward advancing our understanding of topological semimetals and their potential applications in novel electronic devices.

Abstract: We present an infrared spectroscopy study of the layered topological semimetal TaNiTe$_5$, a material with a quasi-one-dimensional structure and strong in-plane anisotropy. Despite its structural features, infrared reflectivity and electronic transport measurements along the $a$ and $c$ crystallographic axes show metallic behavior without evidence of reduced dimensionality. Optical conductivity reveals an anisotropic but conventional metallic response with low scattering rates and a single sharp infrared-active phonon mode at $396$ cm$^{-1}$ ($49$ meV). Ab initio calculations closely match the experimental optical data and confirm a three-dimensional electronic structure. Our results demonstrate that TaNiTe$_5$ behaves as a three-dimensional anisotropic semimetal in its electronic and optical properties.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study tunable nanoscale femtosecond coherent radiation based on a coupled nanowire pair (CNP) structure that is excited by a strong laser. The structure functions as a nanoscale undulator (NU): the electrons moving through the nanogap are driven by a spatially periodic, transverse optical near-field. We show that the transverse near-field can actively shape the electron wavefunction by inducing both a periodic oscillation and a quantum squeezing of its width. We then validate this theoretical framework by numerically solving the relativistically corrected time-dependent Schrödinger equation (RC-TDSE). The generated femtosecond pulse trains can be spectrally, temporally, and spatially controlled. This framework establishes the transverse optical near-field interaction as a novel mechanism to spatiotemporally shape electron wavefunctions, which illuminates a path to versatile platform for on-chip femtosecond coherent light source and the application in free-electron quantum optics.

Abstract: Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer promising opportunities for photonics and optoelectronics due to their narrowband emission, control over the transition dipole moment, and potential for polarized light emission. However, achieving uniform PeNPLs and effective surface passivation major challenges, especially for red-emitting iodide-based compounds. Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission. When integrated into light-emitting diodes, our PeNPL devices achieve a external quantum efficiency of 13.1%, the highest reported for strongly-confined PeNPL-based devices. Taken together, these results establish ancillary ligand-induced synthesis of uniform-monolayer PeNPLs as a decisive route to robust orientation control, positioning it as the central principle for advancing next-generation photonic and display technologies.

Abstract: Fibonacci time quasicrystals can be approximated by temporal supercells to reveal a fractal collection of $k$ gaps, in which wave energy is amplified exponentially. These estimates are validated by the observation of "super" $k$ gaps that are independent of the duration of the temporal supercell. This approach predicts the regions of parametric amplification and provides accurate estimates of the energy growth rate.

Motivation: The article serves as an in-depth analysis of PNCs for quantum applications, providing insights and directions for future work.

Method: A comprehensive review of PNCs and related emissions models with a focus on recent advancements and challenges.

Result: The paper finds that PNCs are promising for practical quantum use but requires further improvements in stability and efficiency.

Conclusion: PNCs are advancing toward practical quantum light sources, but challenges remain that need addressing through synthesis and photonics engineering.

Abstract: Metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have emerged as leading candidates for next-generation quantum emitters, offering a unique combination of high photoluminescence quantum yield, tunable emission, short radiative lifetimes, and record-high single-photon purity under ambient conditions. These properties, together with low-cost and scalable solution-phase fabrication, position PNCs as attractive alternatives to traditional epitaxial and colloidal quantum dots. In this Review, we outline the physical parameters that define quantum emission in PNCs, compare their performance to other established and emerging quantum emitters, and assess the key figures of merit, including photostability, single-photon purity, and photon indistinguishability, required for practical quantum applications. We discuss underlying mechanisms affecting PNC emission behavior and highlight recent advances in improving their quantum emitting properties through synthetic and photonic engineering approaches. While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources.

Motivation:  blood coagulation analysis is crucial for diagnostics, but anticoagulation can distort results. This paper addresses this challenge with a novel method.

Method: utilizes Digital Holographic Microscopy combined with deep learning for label-free, non-invasive blood analysis. builds a system with automated image processing for cell counting and morphological estimation under different anticoagulants.

Result:  KFeOx-NPs successfully prevent coagulation without morphological changes in RBCs, while EDTA induces rapid coagulation within 6 hours. The system offers quantitative analysis potential for therapeutic agents' efficacy.

Conclusion:  the study presents a promising non-invasive, high-throughput method for evaluating anticoagulants, potentially enhancing diagnostic reliability without blood coagulation interference.

Abstract: The coagulation of blood after it is drawn from the body poses a significant challenge for hematological analysis, potentially leading to inaccurate test results and altered cellular characteristics, compromising diagnostic reliability. This paper presents a deep learning-enhanced framework for delineating anticoagulant efficacy ex vivo using Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM). We demonstrate a label-free, non-invasive approach for analyzing human blood samples, capable of accurate cell counting and morphological estimation. A DHM with an automated image processing and deep learning pipeline is built for morphological analysis of the blood cells under two different anti-coagulation agents, e.g. conventional EDTA and novel potassium ferric oxalate nanoparticles (KFeOx-NPs). This enables automated high-throughput screening of cells and estimation of blood coagulation rates when samples are treated with different anticoagulants. Results indicated that KFeOx-NPs prevented human blood coagulation without altering the cellular morphology of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas EDTA incubation caused notable changes within 6 hours of incubation. The system allows for quantitative analysis of coagulation dynamics by assessing parameters like cell clustering and morphology over time in these prepared samples, offering insights into the comparative efficacy and effects of anticoagulants outside the body.

Abstract: Optical fields polarized along three dimensions are frequent in optical microscopy and nanophotonics, and yet retrieving their polarization distribution is challenging. We present the experimental implementation of three-dimensional (3D) Stokes polarimetric imaging of nonparaxial optical fields with nanoscale spatial resolution. This approach extends classical Stokes polarimetry (traditionally limited to paraxial fields) into the nonparaxial regime. We use an array of gold nanospheres, each acting as a localized electric dipolar scatterer, to probe 3D polarization states over a field of view of tens of micrometers. The scattered signal is collected by a high numerical aperture objective lens and separated into its circular polarization components, providing a very simple imaging system. We introduce a computational algorithm to efficiently extract the physical parameters from the generated dipole spread functions with a high throughput across the whole field of view. Finally, we show that this method can also be applied to single-molecule localization and orientation fluorescence microscopy.

Abstract: Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) extends OCT by analyzing the polarization states of backscattered light to quantify tissue birefringence. However, conventional implementations require polarization-diverse detection and are therefore incompatible with most commercial OCT systems. As a result, PS-OCT has largely remained restricted to specialized research groups, limiting its broader scientific and clinical use. Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a key tool for designing nanophotonic structures that manipulate light at sub-wavelength scales. We investigate how to inversely design plasmonic nanostructures using conditional generative adversarial networks. Although a conventional approach of measuring the optical properties of a given nanostructure is conceptually straightforward, inverse design remains difficult because the existence and uniqueness of an acceptable design cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the design space is often large, and simulation-based methods become quickly intractable. Deep learning methods are well-suited to tackle this problem because they can handle effectively high-dimensional input data. We train a conditional generative adversarial network model and use it for inverse design of plasmonic nanostructures based on their extinction cross section spectra. Our main result shows that adding label projection and a novel embedding network to the conditional generative adversarial network model, improves performance in terms of error estimates and convergence speed for the training algorithm. The mean absolute error is reduced by an order of magnitude in the best case, and the training algorithm converges more than three times faster on average. This is shown for two network architectures, a simpler one using a fully connected neural network architecture, and a more complex one using convolutional layers. We pre-train a convolutional neural network and use it as surrogate model to evaluate the performance of our inverse design model. The surrogate model evaluates the extinction cross sections of the design predictions, and we show that our modifications lead to equally good or better predictions of the original design compared to a baseline model. This provides an important step towards more efficient and precise inverse design methods for optical elements.

Abstract: In fluids, vortices form at boundaries between flows of different velocities. Here, we show that pulsed electromagnetic waves form spatiotemporal vortices when light straddles media of different phase velocities. When the resulting relative time-delay is on the order of the pulse duration of light, spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) are formed. This method allows generating arbitrary geometry spatiotemporal vortices, something impossible with previously demonstrated generation schemes. We provide experimental results showing THz frequency light can be encoded with arbitrary spatiotemporal vortex geometries using simple planar fused filament prints made from a commercial 3D printer. We provide several demonstrations of unique geometries including squares, triangles, ring arrays, and arbitrary curves that cannot be generated with existing techniques. We also show that multiple ring and line vortices can be formed simultaneously, which undergo complex reconnections with propagation. While demonstrated at THz frequencies, this concept is directly applicable to visible and infrared light and our theory offers a way for optimizing STOVs for the frequency range and pulse duration of a given light source. This technique provides a practical and straight-forward method to generate arbitrary electromagnetic spatiotemporal vortices and enables production of complex spatiotemporal phenomena like vortex reconnections.

Abstract: Lattice resonances are collective optical modes supported by periodic arrays of scatterers, arising from their coherent interaction enabled by the underlying periodicity. Owing to their collective nature, these resonances produce optical responses that are both stronger and spectrally narrower than those of individual scatterers. While such phenomena have been extensively studied in conventional time-invariant systems, recent advances in time-varying photonics present new opportunities to exploit and enhance the extraordinary characteristics of these collective modes. Here, we investigate lattice resonances in periodic arrays of time-modulated scatterers using a simple framework based on the dipolar approximation and time-Floquet theory, where each scatterer is modeled as a harmonic oscillator with periodically varying optical properties. We begin by analyzing the response of an individual scatterer, leveraging our model to identify the complex eigenfrequencies that define its dynamics. We show that, for the appropriate modulation amplitude and frequency, the imaginary part of one of these eigenfrequencies vanishes, leading to amplification. Building on this, we extend our analysis to a periodic array to investigate the effect of the interplay between temporal modulation and lattice resonances. In contrast to isolated scatterers, the collective nature of lattice resonances introduces a markedly more intricate spectral dependence of the amplification regime. Notably, this amplification emerges at substantially lower modulation strengths, facilitated by the enhanced light-matter interaction and increased lifetime provided by these collective resonances. Our work establishes a simple theoretical framework for understanding collective lattice resonances in time-modulated arrays, enabling dynamic control and amplification of these modes.

We conclude with open challenges: phase stability, mid-IR scalability, coupling to nanophotonic emitters, metrology of vectorial fields, and outline a path toward compact, ultrafast, phase-coherent electron sources and emerging quantum applications powered by nonlinear photonics.

Abstract: We numerically study a gas of two-component fermions coupled to a transversely pumped optical cavity and confined to a two-dimensional static square optical lattice. In the dispersive regime, the steady state of the system is described by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian with cavity-mediated long-range interactions. Using real-space dynamical mean-field theory (RDMFT), we investigate the formation of the (superradiant) checkerboard density-wave phase both at quarter and half filling. We focus on the paramagnetic phase assuming sufficiently high temperatures such that no magnetic long-range order develops. At quarter filling, we find a reentrant homogeneous Fermi liquid to density wave phase transition with increasing temperature, which is due to the higher entropy of the ordered phase. At half filling, in addition to the Fermi liquid to Mott insulator phase transition, marked by a vanishing quasiparticle residue at the Fermi level, we identify the transition into a density-wave phase. Due to perfect Fermi surface nesting at half filling, we find that arbitrarily small long-range interactions destabilize the system towards the density-wave phase in the absence of short-range interactions. By varying short- and long-range interactions at a fixed low temperature, we obtain the full phase diagram and identify a region of coexistence between the homogeneous Fermi liquid and Mott insulating phase with the density-wave phase. In this region, we determine the thermodynamic phase transition by comparing the energies of the different RDMFT solutions.

Conclusion: 实验可验证该研究结果，为相关量子系统的研究提供理论基础。

Abstract: It is known that, under appropriate conditions, mean-field interactions can be canceled in binary BEC, leading to the formation of the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) superfluid, in which the nonlinearity is solely represented by the quartic LHY term. In this work we systematically investigate the existence, stability and evolution of hopfion states in this species of quantum matter. They are characterized by two independent topological winding numbers: inner twist $s$ of the vortex-ring core and overall vorticity $m$. The interplay between the LHY self-repulsion and a trapping harmonic-oscillator potential results in stability of the hopfions with $s = 1$ and $m$ ranging from $0$ to $4$. The hopfions exhibit distinct topological phase distributions along the vertical axis and the radial direction in the horizontal plane. Their effective radius and peak density increase with the chemical potential, along with expansion of the vortex-ring core. Although the instability domain of the hopfion modes broadens with the increase of $m$, stable hopfions persist in a wide range of the chemical potential, up to $m=4$, at least, provided that the norm exceeds a certain threshold value. The predictions are experimentally accessible in currently used BEC setups.

Abstract: The nucleation and dynamics of vortices in the quasi-two-dimensional rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate are explored by taking into account the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the mean-field (MF) theory. Assuming approximate cancellation of the MF interactions, we focus on the formation of a pure LHY superfluid. The effect of rotational frequency $Ω$ is investigated numerically by determining the corresponding number of stable vortices in the superfluid, together with the respective energy per particle $E$ and chemical potential $μ$. The LHY superfluid provides a deep minimum of $E$ and $μ$, indicating that it is a remarkably robust state of quantum matter. By fixing the LHY interaction strength, an exact single-vortex critical frequency is found, along with the respective chemical potential. A notable feature, observed when creating the LHY superfluid with fewer than five vortices, which is understood as being due to the superfluid's nonlinearity and trapping aspect ratio, is the large frequency ranges admitting the production of two and four vortices, as compared to the small frequency ranges to obtain one and three vortices.

Conclusion: The paper asserts that with proper care, coherent-state path integrals yield reliable results for equilibrium thermodynamics of many-particle quantum systems.

Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with contact and finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with contact and finite-range interactions.

### [24] [A Hierarchy of Fibonacci Forbidden-Word Hamiltonians: From the Golden Chain to the Plastic Chain and Aperiodic Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10672)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We introduce an infinite, scale-aligned hierarchy of Hamiltonians by forbidding the minimal forbidden factors of the Fibonacci word up to length $F_K$, resulting in ground-state languages with decreasing exponential growth constants. The process creates a staircase of topological-entropy plateaus leading to an aperiodic fixed point with a specific recurrence relation and closed-form solution governed by the plastic constant. Numerical results on a D-Wave quantum annealer support these predictions, showing that higher rungs require reverse annealing to achieve high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of frustration-free Hamiltonians and their ground-state properties is a fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics. This work provides insights into the relationship between Fibonacci words, renormalization-group flows, and quantum annealing.

Method: Mathematical analysis of Fibonacci word factors, derivation of recurrence relations, and numerical simulations on a D-Wave quantum annealer.

Result: The ground-state languages exhibit exponential growth constants that decrease monotonically from the golden chain value to 1. The first nontrivial rung, $K=4$, follows a specific four-term linear recurrence relation and has a closed-form solution governed by the plastic constant $ρ≈1.3247$. Numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions, with higher rungs requiring reverse annealing for high success rates.

Conclusion: This work establishes a connection between Fibonacci words, renormalization-group flows, and quantum annealing, providing a new framework for studying frustration-free Hamiltonians and their ground-state properties.

Abstract: We introduce an infinite, scale-aligned hierarchy of one-dimensional, frustration-free Hamiltonians by forbidding the minimal forbidden factors of the Fibonacci word up to length $F_K$, the $K$-th Fibonacci number. The ground-state languages have exponential growth constants $λ_K$ that decrease monotonically, starting from the value associated with the ``golden chain'' (approximately 1.618) and progressing toward 1. This process yields a staircase of topological-entropy plateaus that flows to an aperiodic fixed point, also known as the Fibonacci subshift. The first nontrivial rung ($K=4$) is the ``Plastic chain,'' which forbids \texttt{SS} and \texttt{LLL}. We prove its ground-state counts follow a specific four-term linear recurrence relation and provide a closed-form solution governed by the plastic constant $ρ\approx 1.3247$. We propose an energy-entropy scaling where the energy penalty for each new forbidden pattern is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of the growth constants from the previous and current rungs, turning the sequence of projectors into an explicit renormalization-group flow from the initial high-entropy phase to the zero-entropy aperiodic fixed point. Algebraically, exact Temperley-Lieb braiding compatibility holds only at the base rung, $K=3$ (which forbids only \texttt{SS}); higher rungs define constrained aperiodic Hamiltonian codes rather than Temperley-Lieb representations. Small instances realized on a D-Wave quantum annealer match these predictions: $K=3$ is trivial, $K=4$ resolves a unit gap with moderate success, and $K\ge 5$ instances require reverse annealing to exceed $99\%$ success, clarifying reduction penalties and embedding variability.

Abstract: Machine learning models are used for pattern recognition analysis of big data, without direct human intervention. The task of unsupervised learning is to find the probability distribution that would best describe the available data, and then use it to make predictions for observables of interest. Classical models generally fit the data to Boltzmann distribution of Hamiltonians with a large number of tunable parameters. Quantum extensions of these models replace classical probability distributions with quantum density matrices. An advantage can be obtained only when features of density matrices that are absent in classical probability distributions are exploited. Such situations depend on the input data as well as the targeted observables. Explicit examples are discussed that bring out the constraints limiting possible quantum advantage. The problem-dependent extent of quantum advantage has implications for both data analysis and sensing applications.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of key quantum correlations - Negativity (NG), Quantum Discord (QD), and Quantum-Memory-Assisted Entropic Uncertainty (QM-EUR) - in a bipartite two-qubit system under the influence of external pulses and various decoherence channels, including amplitude damping (gamma_amp), pure dephasing (gamma_deph), and pulse-induced dephasing (G), while different regimes of inter-qubit coupling (Jzz, Jxx), qubit energy splitting (epsilon), and pulse parameters (A_pulse, beta_pulse) are explored. Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication.

Abstract: Classical shadow tomography offers a scalable route to estimating properties of quantum states, but the resulting reduced density matrices (RDMs) often violate constraints that ensure they represent $N$-electron states -- known as $N$-representability conditions -- because of statistical and hardware noise. We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves. This framework provides a robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Distributed architecture is a promising route to scaling fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) beyond the inherent limitations of single processors. For practical implementation of distributed FTQC, logical Bell pair preparation must be designed not only for efficient Bell pair consumption but also for the spacetime volume of the protocol; however, entanglement distillation protocols have primarily focused on minimizing the consumption of Bell pairs, often resulting in protocols that require a substantial number of local operations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations. Guided by this metric, we propose entanglement boosting protocol, which achieves efficient preparation of logical Bell pairs encoded in rotated surface code with LLV reduced by orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. In this protocol, paralleling recent advances in magic state cultivation, we employ soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress the logical error rates of Bell pairs to practical levels in the order of $10^{-10}$ from fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs while all local operations are implementable within a spatial region of a single surface code patch. We also present a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation using high-rate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling arbitrarily low logical error rates while also maintaining physically efficient implementations. These results pave the way for the practical implementation of distributed FTQC, reinforcing the benefits of fast interconnect technologies and serving as a guiding principle for the efficient design of protocols and devices.

TL;DR: A single-crystal diamond-based NV magnetometer with 40% contrast and 250 pT/sqrt(Hz) sensitivity achieves flat noise performance up to 1 kHz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NV centers offer high sensitivity for magnetometry, and integrating them with a microwave cavity enhances both coupling and readout, enabling design of ultrasensitive sensors.

Method: Using a microwave cavity, the magnetometer achieves enhanced spin-photon coupling. AC bias fields enable individual addressing of crystallographic orientations for precise vector reconstruction.

Result: The magnetometer achieves 250 pT/sqrt(Hz) sensitivity in the DC-1 kHz range, with a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/sqrt(Hz) as predicted.

Conclusion: This magnetometer represents a significant leap in single-axis magnetometry sensitivity, leveraging advanced coupling mechanisms and cavity-based readout technologies for enhanced performance.

Abstract: We demonstrate $4π$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.

Temperature is measured along a single-mode fiber routed across a custom printed circuit board (PCB) with 1 cm$^2$ heating elements, using optical time-domain reflectometry of Raman signals detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). This approach enables two-dimensional thermal mapping of the PCB under heating configurations with multiple hotspots. A spatial resolution of 3 cm and a temperature accuracy of 2 °C are achieved with an integration time of 5 minutes. Thermography can be performed down to 77 K, revealing that the PCB thermal resistance decreases by nearly an order of magnitude compared to room temperature, due to enhanced convective cooling in liquid nitrogen. These results establish centimetre-scale RDTS as a robust technique for real-time, spatially resolved thermography of electronic circuits, particularly in regimes where infrared imaging is ineffective, such as at low temperatures or within volumetric electronic architectures.

Abstract: Understanding the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of entangled biphoton states is essential for free-space quantum communication protocols. Using the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and the Kolmogorov turbulence model, we derive an analytical expression for the combined density operator of the signal and idler fields generated via SPDC, following propagation through separate turbulent channels. By expressing this density operator in the continuous position basis, we show how the spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, as they transition from being quantum to classical in nature. We further identify a finite range of propagation distances over which the angle-OAM entanglement is maximized, which provides valuable insights for designing free-space quantum communication links operating over several kilometers through the turbulent atmosphere.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centres (NVs) are promising solid-state nanoscale quantum sensors for applications ranging from material science to biotechnology. Using multiple sensors simultaneously offers advantages for probing spatiotemporal correlations of fluctuating fields or the dynamics of point defects. In this work, by integrating NVs with foundry silicon-nitride photonic integrated circuits, we realise the scalable operation of eight localised NV sensors in an array, with simultaneous, distinct readout of the individual sensors. Using the eight NV sensors and machine-learning methods for multi-point magnetic field reconstruction, we demonstrate microscale magnetic localisation of a 30 $μ$m-sized needle tip. Experimentally, the needle tip can be localised with an error below its dimension and tracked dynamically with high fidelity. We further simulate the feasibility of our platform for monitoring the position and orientation of magnetic microrobots designed for biological and clinical purposes. Without the complexity of bulk optics, our photonic-integrated multi-sensor platform presents a step towards real-life biomedical applications under out-of-the-lab conditions.

*Jonathan Teo,Lee Xin Wei,Hoong Chuin Lau*

TL;DR:  paper introduces a quantum computational method called Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS) that optimises Quantum Reinforcement Learning models for solving large combinatorial optimisation problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  quantum computing has the potential to solve complex optimisation problems, but current methods struggle with scaling. This paper aims to address this limitation by introducing an efficient training optimization called SIGS, which enables models to perform well even on larger problem sizes. 

Method:  the authors propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL). The method is applied to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 Equivariant Quantum Circuit (EQC) for TSP instances with up to 350 nodes. This approach significantly improves simulation times while maintaining the quality of the optimality gap. 

Result:  the results show that SIGS reduces simulation times by 96.4% compared to traditional methods for TSP-100 instances. The mean optimality gap is within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set, demonstrating that SIGS enables efficient analysis of QRL algorithm performance for larger problem sizes through a theoretical explanation called Size-Invariant Properties. 

Conclusion:  SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the quantum computing and reinforcement learning communities, allowing them to evaluate QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes to assess scalability and robustness. This work contributes to advancing the use of quantum computers for solving real-world optimisation problems. 

Abstract: The Equivariant Quantum Circuit (EQC) for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been shown to achieve near-optimal performance in solving small TSP problems (up to 20 nodes) using only two parameters at depth 1. However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes. We provide a theoretical explanation for SIGS called the Size-Invariant Properties that goes beyond the concept of equivariance discussed in prior literature.

Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement offers significant advantages over low-dimensional ones in various information-processing tasks. However, to harness these advantages, it is crucial that the quantum channels used to store or transmit the subsystems of an entangled system not only preserve entanglement but also maintain its dimensionality above a certain threshold. The maximum entanglement dimension that a channel can preserve is referred to as its effective dimensionality, since the channel cannot be used to transmit information of dimension greater than that in a single use. In this work, we present a method to certify whether a quantum channel can preserve entanglement dimension above a given threshold. Unlike existing approaches, our method is faithful -- it can be applied to any channel, and avoids common assumptions such as reliable preparation of entangled states, auxiliary side channels, or perfect measurement devices. Moreover, the method can be extended to faithfully certify other classes of non-resource-breaking channels, such as non-NPT-breaking channels. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our certification scheme through explicit examples.

### [35] [Universal Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation for Quantum $f-$Divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10817)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The abstract provides a universal χ²-mixture representation for Petz f-divergences in quantum states, analyzing distinguishability, identifying χ²_λ as building blocks, and deriving closed-form weights for canonical f-divergences. It also presents a thermodynamic uncertainty relation using these χ²_λ components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need to understand and quantify distinguishability between quantum states, which is fundamental in quantum information and thermodynamics. The use of χ²-divergences and their representation could provide new tools for analyzing quantum systems and their thermodynamic properties.

Method: The authors employ tools from operator theory and functional analysis, specifically leveraging the Stieltjes representation of generator functions f. They derive a universal χ²-mixture representation for quantum f-divergences and utilize the Chapman-Robbins variational representation to establish a quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation.

Result: The key findings include: 1) a universal χ²-mixture representation for quantum f-divergences, 2) explicit expressions for weights w_f(λ) for standard f-divergences, and 3) a quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation derived from the χ²_λ components that links divergence measures to quantum observables' statistics.

Conclusion: This work bridges concepts from quantum information theory and mathematical statistics by providing a novel framework for f-divergences in terms of χ²_λ. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation derived opens new avenues for studying quantum systems under thermodynamic constraints and reveals connections between distinguishability measures and quantum observables statistics.

Abstract: We show that any Petz $f$-divergence (where $f$ is operator convex) between quantum states admits a universal $χ^2$-mixture representation: the distinguishability of $ρ$ from $σ$ is obtained as a positive superposition of quadratic contrasts $χ^2_λ$, with nonnegative weights $w_f(λ)$ determined explicitly from the Stieltjes representation of the generator $f$. This identifies $χ^2_λ$ as atomic building blocks for quantum $f$-divergences and yields closed-form $w_f$ for canonical choices (relative entropy/KL, Hellinger/Bures, R'{e}nyi). By mapping $χ^2_λ$ into a classical Pearson $χ^2$, we leverage the Chapman-Robbins variational representation and obtain a tight and universal quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation: any $f$-divergence is lower bounded by a function of the statistics of quantum observables (mean and variance), reproducing previous and novel results in quantum thermodynamics as applications.

Abstract: The goal of quantum channel discrimination and estimation is to determine the identity of an unknown channel from a discrete or continuous set, respectively. The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds. We also provide alternative proofs for several established results in an effort to present a consistent and unified framework for quantum channel discrimination and estimation, which we believe will be helpful in addressing future questions in the field.

Motivation: The increasing reliance on networked applications necessitates robust synchronization mechanisms, especially in quantum space where vulnerabilities like intercept-resend attacks and spoofing are significant threats.

Method: The approach involves developing a quantum secure time transfer (QSTT) system with two key enhancements: (1) utilizing self-generated quantum keys for information-theoretically secure transmission of timing data, and (2) introducing an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption for the remaining timing data within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture.

Result: The experimental demonstration of this system marks a significant advancement, offering the most robust implementation of QSTT to date.

Conclusion: This innovation represents a substantial leap forward in securing quantum communication networks against various threats, ensuring reliable and secure clock synchronization in diverse applications.

Abstract: High-precision clock synchronization is essential for a wide range of network-distributed applications. In the quantum space, these applications include communication, sensing, and positioning. However, current synchronization techniques are vulnerable to attacks, such as intercept-resend attacks, spoofing, and delay attacks. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new quantum secure time transfer (QSTT) system, subsequently used for clock synchronization, that largely negates such attacks. Novel to our system is the optimal use of self-generated quantum keys within the QSTT to information-theoretically secure the maximum amount of timing data; as well as the introduction, within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, of an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption sequence of the remaining timing data. With these enhancements, we argue that our new system represents the most robust implementation of QSTT to date.

Abstract: Spontaneous macroscopic quantum synchronization is an emergent phenomenon where an ensemble of quantum oscillators achieves global phase coherence through the interplay of interaction and dissipation. To illuminate this phenomenon, we study an ensemble of two-level systems (TLS) and establish its associated nonlinear quantum master equation, for which self-consistent analytical solutions of quantum synchronization can be obtained. The trajectories on the Bloch sphere vividly illustrate how dissipation and interaction drive the system toward a synchronized state. We present a phase diagram for macroscopic synchronization as a function of interaction strength and the gain-to-damping ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate full synchronization and partial synchronization between two groups of TLS with different natural frequencies. This work establishes ensemble of TLS as a remarkable system for understanding spontaneous quantum synchronization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum processor fidelity through better MCM handling is crucial for efficient algorithms and error correction.

Method: MERA uses lightweight profiling, error-aware mapping, and dynamic scheduling with decoupling.

Result: Fidelity improvements of 24.94%-52.00% over Qiskit compiler and up to 122.58% over QR-Map.

Conclusion: MERA effectively reduces MCM errors, enhancing fidelity especially in dynamic quantum circuits.

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement (MCM) provides the capability for qubit reuse and dynamic control in quantum processors, enabling more resource-efficient algorithms and supporting error-correction procedures. However, MCM introduces several sources of error, including measurement-induced crosstalk, idling-qubit decoherence, and reset infidelity, and these errors exhibit pronounced qubit-dependent variability within a single device. Since existing compilers such as the Qiskit-compiler and QR-Map (the state-of-art qubit reuse compiler) do not account for this variability, circuits with frequent MCM operations often experience substantial fidelity loss.
  In thie paper, we propose MERA, a compilation framework that performs MCM-error-aware layout, routing, and scheduling. MERA leverages lightweight profiling to obtain a stable per-qubit MCM error distribution, which it uses to guide error-aware qubit mapping and SWAP insertions. To further mitigate MCM-related decoherence and crosstalk, MERA augments as-late-as-possible scheduling with context-aware dynamic decoupling. Evaluated on 27 benchmark circuits, MERA achieves 24.94% -- 52.00% fidelity improvement over the Qiskit compiler (optimization level 3) without introducing additional overhead. On QR-Map-generated circuits, it improves fidelity by 29.26% on average and up to 122.58% in the best case, demonstrating its effectiveness for dynamic circuits dominated by MCM operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the challenge of measurement-induced disturbances in quantum error correction, which is critical for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: The method involves developing a readout protocol for a D-dimensional quantum system that adaptively switches to measure only D-1 subspace after a positive outcome, reducing disturbances by relying on negative-result measurements that do not perturb the Hamiltonian.

Result: The protocol was successfully applied to an 8-dimensional $^{123}$Sb nuclear qudit, resulting in a significant increase in readout fidelity from 98.93% to 99.61% and a reduction in readout time by a factor of three. Additionally, the study extended to a 10-dimensional $^{73}$Ge nuclear spin system, revealing the impact of non-ideal quantum non-demolition readouts across different platforms.

Conclusion: This work introduces an efficient adaptive readout protocol that minimizes measurement-induced errors while maintaining high readout fidelity, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple quantum systems and providing a scalable solution that requires minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.

Abstract: Ultrafast imaging of photon statistics in two dimensions is a powerful tool for probing non-equilibrium and transient optical phenomena, yet it remains experimentally challenging due to the simultaneous need for high temporal resolution and statistical fidelity. In this work, we demonstrate spatially resolved single-shot measurements of photon number distributions using difference-frequency generation (DFG) in a nonlinear BBO crystal. We show that our platform can discriminate between coherent and thermal photon statistics across two spatial dimensions with picosecond resolution. At the same time, we find that the retrieved distributions deviate from the ideal ones, a consequence of vacuum contamination and the multimodal response of the amplifier. To explain this, we develop a temporal mode decomposition framework that captures the essential physics of signal amplification and fluorescence, and quantitatively reproduces the experimental findings. This establishes a robust approach for measuring two-dimensional photon statistics while clarifying the fundamental factors that limit the fidelity of such measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining the nonlocality of the Aharonov-Bohm effect and its underlying physics

Method: Mathematical derivation focusing on topology impact on quantum states

Result: Illustrates that the phase shift arises from the topology of the configuration space, specifically due to the presence of a puncture at the origin when the magnetic field is confined

Conclusion: Emphasizes the role of topology in quantum mechanics beyond conventional local effects

Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a physical phenomenon in which the quantum state of a charged particle acquires a phase shift that is directly proportional to the magnetic flux, $Φ$, due to a (classical) magnetic field, ${\mathbf B}$, which is confined in a spatial region from which the magnetic field cannot escape. Even though the charged particle is not allowed to interact with the magnetic field, it accumulates a phase shift that affects the interference pattern produced. Not surprisingly, this apparent nonlocality is puzzling and counter intuitive. In this work, we provide an explanation that explains the physics underlying this apparent nonlocality. We find that the role of the confined magnetic field is to impart a puncture in the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2$, of the charge. Therefore, the quantum state corresponding to the charged quantum particle acquires the phase shift due to its response to the modified topology of the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, corresponding to the charge.

Abstract: Testing the predictions of quantum mechanics has been one of the main experimental endeavors for decades. Recent advancements in technology led to a number of demonstrations which test non-classicality via specific computational tasks. Limitations of these experiments include dependence on complexity theory assumptions, susceptibility to hardware noise and inefficient verification, raising questions about their scalability. We propose to test non-classicality using a game based on complement sampling, an efficiently verifiable problem that achieves the largest possible separation between quantum and classical computation when both input and output represent samples from probability distributions. When restricting the input to instances inspired by the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, our game admits an exponentially large violation of classicality without relying on computational hardness assumptions. We execute the game on Quantinuum System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computers, with experiments consisting of thousands of different circuits on up to 55 qubits. The observed scores can be explained by a systematic adoption of a quantum strategy, further corroborating the quantum nature of the hardware in an efficient and scalable way.

Abstract: The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.

Abstract: We investigate the fast-forward and time-scaling properties of superconducting resonators under a coherent drive. We propose a scheme for perfect displacement of a superconducting resonator by modulating the drive amplitude based on fast-forward scaling theory. Furthermore, we propose a scheme exploiting both the fast-forward and time-scaling properties that enables perfect displacement through detuning modulation. The proposed schemes are also applicable to a subsystem that can be effectively represented by a driven resonator. In particular, we apply the latter scheme to fast and high-fidelity displacement of a coupler between Kerr parametric oscillators.

Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.

Abstract: Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.

Abstract: Efficient state preparation is a challenging and important problem in quantum computing. In this work, we present a recursive state preparation algorithm that combines logarithmic-depth Dicke state circuits with Hamming weight encoders for efficiently preparing ``leaf-separable" quantum states. The algorithm is built on binary partition trees, generalized weight distribution blocks (gWDBs), and leaf-level encoders. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by numerically simulating it on randomly generated target states with between 4 and 15 qubits. Compared to general state preparation approaches which require $O(2^n)$ CX gates, our algorithm achieves a circuit depth of $O(k\log\frac{n}{k} + 2^k)$ and uses $O(n(k+2^k))$ two-qubit gates, where $k < n$ denotes the subtree size. We also compare implementations of the algorithm with and without the use of ancilla qubits, providing a detailed analysis of the trade-offs in circuit depth and two-qubit gate counts. These results contribute to scalable state preparation for quantum algorithms that require structured inputs such as Dicke or near-Dicke states.

Abstract: The use of nuclear spins as physical sensing systems is disadvantaged by their low signal responsivity, particularly when compared to sensing techniques based on electron spins. This primarily results from the small nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and the difficulties in achieving high spin polarization. Here we develop a new approach to investigating the response of hyperpolarized molecular nuclear spins to magnetic fields and demonstrate orders-of-magnitude enhanced magnetic responsivity over state-of-the-art proton and Overhauser magnetometers. Using hyperpolarized molecules with proton spins, we report the realization of magnetic amplification in linear and nonlinear types. We further extend this amplification to hyperpolarized scalar-coupled multi-spin molecules and observe substantial magnetic amplification exceeding 10%. Moreover, we observe an anomalous amplification with dispersive frequency dependence that originates from magnetic interference effects. Our work highlights the potential of hyperpolarized molecular nuclear spins for use in a new class of quantum sensors, with promising applications in both applied and fundamental physics, including highly accurate absolute magnetometry and the exploration of axion-nucleon exotic interactions.

Abstract: Limit-cycle oscillators are the basic building blocks for synchronization; yet, the notion of a quantum limit cycle has remained unclear. Here, we study quantum limit cycles and synchronization in the presence of continuous heterodyne measurement. The resulting quantum trajectories, i.e., time evolutions of the quantum state conditioned on the measurement outcome, make the quantum limit cycles apparent. We focus on the paradigmatic model of the quantum van-der-Pol oscillator and on two-level systems. Our work provides insights into limit cycles in quantum systems, emphasizing their similarity to classical limit cycles subject to noise. Additionally, we connect theoretical measures of quantum synchronization to quantities experimentally accessible via heterodyne detection.

Abstract: The compatibility of special relativity and Quantum Mechanics has been questioned by several authors. The origin of this tension can be traced back mainly to the introduction of the measurement processes and the corresponding wave function reduction, which play a crucial role in Quantum Mechanics. We approach this problem within a recent proposal for a model of Quantum Mechanics, where the measurement is explicitly described as a specific stochastic process. This implements ordinary Quantum Mechanics, where measurement and reduction are treated as phenomenological events of unknown origin without any physical justification. To state clearly the question, we first discuss and establish the effect of a Lorentz transformation on a generic wave function in space-time. This allows to formulate the relativistic version of the model. We then consider few thought experiments in order to analyze to what extent Quantum Mechanics follows relativistic invariance and find the specific critical points where non invariance possibly occurs. The relevance of this analysis on the experimental observations is also discussed.

In this work we characterize the eigenmodes of 2D and 3D regular arrays, using a method which can be used for both infinite and very large systems. In particular, we show how finite-size effects impact the lifetimes of these large arrays. Our results may have interesting applications for quantum memories and topological effects in ordered atomic arrays.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of variational quantum algorithms for particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics. A quantum ansatz based on Monte Carlo Tree Search is designed and tested for different problem sizes, comparing two formulations as a ground-state energy problem and a system of linear equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing holds potential in addressing complex computational challenges in fields like high-energy physics. The motivation behind this work is to leverage variational quantum algorithms for a practical problem in particle physics - particle track reconstruction. This is particularly important considering the increasing computational demands in this field and the potential of quantum computing to provide efficient solutions.

Method: The study employs quantum architecture search using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to design quantum circuits for the particle track reconstruction problem. Two distinct formulations are considered: one as a ground-state energy problem and the other as a system of linear equations. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance and computational cost of the quantum approach for different problem sizes.

Result: The experimental results reveal that the designed quantum ansatz, optimized using MCTS, achieves better performance and lower computational costs compared to traditional methods for smaller problem sizes. However, the quantum approach's scalability remains a concern, with increasing computational cost for larger problems. The success of the approach on smaller instances suggests potential for optimization and scalability in future research.

Conclusion: The research successfully demonstrates that variational quantum algorithms can be effectively applied to particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics. The use of quantum architecture search based on MCTS provides a promising framework for optimizing quantum algorithms for similar problems. As quantum computing technology continues to advance, further research is needed to address the challenges of scalability and cost reduction in quantum solutions for real-world problems.

Abstract: Quantum Computing is a rapidly developing field with the potential to tackle the increasing computational challenges faced in high-energy physics. In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of variational quantum algorithms in solving the particle track reconstruction problem. We present an analysis of two distinct formulations for identifying straight-line tracks in a multilayer detection system, inspired by the LHCb vertex detector. The first approach is formulated as a ground-state energy problem, while the second approach is formulated as a system of linear equations. This work addresses one of the main challenges when dealing with variational quantum algorithms on general problems, namely designing an expressive and efficient quantum ansatz working on tracking events with fixed detector geometry. For this purpose, we employed a quantum architecture search method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to design the quantum circuits for different problem sizes. We provide experimental results to test our approach on both formulations for different problem sizes in terms of performance and computational cost.

Motivation: The need for efficient simulation of quantum systems while minimizing computational resources.

Method: Expressing desired Hamiltonians as a sum of local unitary transformations from an Ising Hamiltonian.

Result: A protocol developed that requires at most quadratic terms in system size.

Conclusion: This reduces pre-processing computational load, enabling scalable digital-analog simulations.

Abstract: Digital-analog is a quantum computational paradigm that employs the natural interaction Hamiltonian of a system as the entangling resource, combined with single qubit gates, to implement universal quantum operations. As in the case of its digital gate-based counterpart, designing digital-analog circuits that employ optimal quantum resources often requires an exceedingly large classical computational time. In this work we find a suboptimal solution to this exponentially large problem, showing that it can be solved within polynomial computational time. In particular, we provide an exact solution for the problem of expressing arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians as the sum of local unitary transformations of an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian, with the total number of required terms being at most quadratic in system size. This allows us to design a digital-analog simulation protocol that avoids employing numerical optimization over a large parameter space at the preprocessing stage, minimizing computational resources and allowing for further scaling.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the coherence and spectral diffusion of photoluminescence from B centers in hexagonal boron nitride under non-resonant excitation. They observe that the emission lineshape is homogeneous with a linewidth increasing with laser power and broadened by spectral diffusion. At short times, the linewidth is just a factor ~2 above the Fourier limit, but at long times, it exceeds gigahertz. This study enhances understanding of decoherence processes in hBN-based quantum emitters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding decoherence processes is crucial for optimizing quantum emitters' performance.

Method: They used photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy to examine the emission lineshape under continuous wave excitation, measuring linewidth and spectral diffusion over time.

Result: The data shows the emission line shape is homogeneous, with linewidth increasing with laser power. Spectral diffusion causes the linewidth to rise at a timescale of 10 to 100 microseconds. At low power, the linewidth is ~2 times the Fourier limit, but at long times, it exceeds gigahertz.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into the decoherence mechanisms of B centers in hBN, which is important for improving their use in quantum applications.

Abstract: The potential of solid-state quantum emitters for applications critically depends on several key figures of merit. One of the most important is the quantum coherence of the emitted single photons, which can be compromised by fast dephasing and spectral diffusion. In hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers (or B centers) are seen as favorable in this regard, in the light of prior studies mainly based on resonant excitation. Yet, their coherence properties in the more accessible regime of non-resonant excitation (or photoluminescence) has not been extensively characterized. Here, we investigate the coherence and spectral diffusion of the photoluminescence from a B center in the continuous wave regime using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy. We determine that the emission lineshape consists in a homogeneous contribution, whose linewidth increases with the laser power, and which is broadened by spectral diffusion at a timescale of 10 to 100 microseconds. At low power and short time, the emission line is only a factor ~2 above the Fourier limit, while at long times, the inhomogeneous linewidth increases up to more than a gigahertz. Our work deepens the understanding of decoherence processes of this preeminent family of quantum emitters in hBN.

Abstract: In the future high-luminosity LHC era, high-energy physics experiments face unprecedented computational challenges for event reconstruction. Employing the LHCb vertex locator as a case study we investigate a novel approach for charged particle track reconstruction. The algorithm hinges on minimizing an Ising-like Hamiltonian using matrix inversion. Solving this matrix inversion classically achieves reconstruction efficiencies akin to current state-of-the-art algorithms. Exploiting the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm for linear systems holds the promise of an exponential speedup in the number of input hits over its classical counterpart, contingent on the conditions of efficient quantum phase estimation (QPE) and effectively reading out the algorithm's output. This contribution builds on previous work by Nicotra et al and strives to fulfill these conditions and further streamlines the algorithm's circuit depth by a factor up to $10^4$. Our version of the HHL algorithm restricts the QPE precision to one bit, largely reducing circuit depth and addressing HHL's readout issue. Furthermore, this allows for the implementation of a post-processing algorithm that reconstructs event Primary Vertices (PVs). The findings presented here aim to further illuminate the potential of harnessing quantum computing for the future of particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics.

The quantum fluctuations of the surface electromagnons drive a nearby graphene monolayer into an anyonic Chern insulator, characterized by anyonic quasi-particles and a topological gap that decays polynomially with the graphene-substrate distance. Our work opens a path to controllably break time-reversal symmetry and induce exotic quantum states through cavity vacuum fluctuations.

Abstract: Resonant parametric modulation is a major tool of studying magnetic systems. For a spin-1/2 chain in a strong magnetic field, the resulting excitations can be mapped on fermionic excitations in the Kitaev chain. We show that the response to the modulation turn-on allows one to reveal dynamical aspects of the nontrivial topology of the periodic chain. In the topological regime, depending on how fast the turn-on is, the system displays the absence of spatial magnetization correlations or their increase with the increasing detuning of the modulation from resonance. The transition between the topological and trivial regimes is controlled by the modulation frequency.

*M. Ryzhii,V. Ryzhii,C. Tang,T. Otsuji,M. S. Shur*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the S-shaped current-voltage (IV) characteristic in perforated graphene metasurfaces (PGMs) arises from electron-hole asymmetry and thermal conduction influenced by doping levels and voltage bias. By creating constrictions with GNR bridges, the study demonstrates that these structures act as energy barriers, enabling thermionic currents between connected graphene ribbons. Peltier heating of carriers within the ribbons further amplifies the current, leading to electrothermal breakdown and negative differential resistance. The degree of electron-hole asymmetry is critical in this feedback mechanism, shaping the overall IV response. These insights are valuable for designing PGM-based devices like voltage-controlled switches and terahertz detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphene-based electronic devices are rapidly advancing, and understanding their nonlinear IV characteristics is essential for optimizing their performance and stability in applications such as fast switches and detectors.

Method: This study involves modeling and simulation of electron and hole populations in GMRs with GNR bridges. The influence of doping and voltage bias on carrier populations and thermal conduction is analyzed through theoretical frameworks and experiments, focusing on how these factors modify the current-voltage response to produce S-shaped characteristics with negative differential resistance.

Result: The research reveals that electron-hole asymmetry and thermal conduction play a crucial role in the formation of S-shaped IV characteristics. The constrictions formed by GNR bridges facilitate thermionic currents, and Peltier heating amplifies these currents, leading to electrothermal breakdown. This mechanism is responsible for the emergence of negative differential resistance, with the degree of asymmetry significantly affecting the feedback strength and the overall device response.

Conclusion: The findings provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing PGM-based devices by tailoring the doping levels and voltage bias to enhance the nonlinear IV characteristics, potentially improving the efficiency and reliability of voltage-controlled switches, incandescent emitters, and terahertz bolometric detectors.

Abstract: We examine the robustness of the S-shaped current-voltage characteristics associated with hot-carrier-induced electrical breakdown in perforated graphene metasurfaces (PGMs) as a function of doping. The perforation of the graphene layer forms interdigital arrays of graphene microribbons (GMRs) interconnected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. These GNR constrictions act as energy barriers for electrons and holes emitted from the GMRs and govern the inter-GMR thermionic current under an applied bias voltage. The doping and the voltage bias establish distinct electron and hole populations in adjacent GMRs. Peltier heating of these carriers within the GMRs increases their effective temperatures, thereby enhancing the inter-GMR current. The resulting positive feedback between carrier heating and current amplification can trigger an electrothermal breakdown, transforming a superlinear current-voltage dependence into an S-shaped characteristic exhibiting negative differential resistance. The degree of electron-hole asymmetry significantly influences this positive feedback and strongly modifies the overall current-voltage response. These results provide a framework for optimizing PGM-based devices employing GMR/GNR architectures, including voltage-controlled fast switches, incandescent emitters, and terahertz bolometric detectors.

Abstract: Electric conductivities may reveal the topological and magnetic properties of band structures in solids, especially for two-dimensional unpaired Dirac fermions. In this work, we evaluate the longitudinal and Hall conductivity for unpaired Dirac fermions in the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation and find a nearly semi-elliptic relation between the minimal conductivity and Hall conductivities in the Dirac fermions. Near the charge neutrality point, disorder may drive a metal-insulator transition, and enhance the longitudinal conductivity. For the massless case, the minimal conductivity $σ_{xx}^*$ coexists with the half-quantized Hall conductivity $e^2/2h$, forming an indicator for the parity anomalous semimetal. The relation signals a disorder-induced metallic phase that bridges two topologically distinct insulating phases, and agrees with the recent experimental observation in magnetic topological insulators.

Abstract: We derive the full spectrum of decorated Cayley trees that constitute tree analogs of selected two-dimensional Euclidean lattices; namely of the Lieb, the double Lieb, the kagome, and the star lattice. The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states.

Abstract: We propose a microscopic, weak-coupling mechanism by which generic Chern bands relax toward ideal bands. We consider coupling interacting electrons to a Caldeira-Leggett like Ohmic bosonic bath. Using the Born-Markov approximation, Slater determinant states of a Chern band under Hartree-Fock approximation evolve toward Slater determinant states corresponding to an ideal Chern band. We validate our proposal by performing numerical simulation of a massive Dirac model, showing that the Berry curvature and quantum metric indeed co-evolve to saturate the trace condition. Our proposal provides a concrete dissipative route to realize ideal Chern bands, a fundamental building block for the stabilization of fractional Chern insulators.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate orbital accumulation driven by chiral phonons via orbital-dependent electron-lattice coupling. We derive a formula for the orbital accumulation induced by classical lattice dynamics or nonequilibrium phonons, using the Berry curvature, linear response theory, and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We show that chiral phonons primarily couple to orbital quadrupole moments and that static orbital dipole accumulation can be generated in the second-order of lattice displacement. Our study provides a useful method for generating orbital accumulation without using spin-orbit interaction.

Abstract: Multiple Andreev reflections in voltage-biased Josephson junctions give rise to the subharmonic gap structure in the conductance, which is widely used to characterize transport properties and estimate the induced gap in the junctions. Here we theoretically investigate the evolution of the subharmonic gap structure in spinful Josephson junctions. Spin mixing introduced by the spin-orbit coupling opens avoided crossings in the dispersion relation of the leads, which, as we demonstrate, subsequently results in pronounced multiple Andreev reflection features in the conductance traces. We analyze how these features evolve under an external magnetic field and explain that their visibility in conductance is governed by the spin polarization of the bands.

Abstract: We develop a Fokker-Planck approach to describe the dynamics of staggered magnetization and thermal fluctuations in a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic system with uniaxial anisotropy. Beginning with a classical model for the antiferromagnetic system, we incorporate a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented by Langevin fields to account for thermal fluctuations, and we derive the Fokker-Planck equation governing the probability distribution function of the spin configuration. Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the extensive localization of bulk modes at the boundaries, has attracted significant attention as a hallmark feature of non-Hermitian topology. This localization invalidates the conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating an analysis under open boundary conditions even in the thermodynamic limit. The Amoeba formulation addresses this challenge by computing the spectral potential rather than the spectrum itself. Based on the (strong) Szegö limit theorem and its topological generalization, this approach reduces the evaluation of the potential to an optimization problem involving the Ronkin function. However, while the generalized Szegö limit theorem is formally applicable in arbitrary dimensions, its implementation is limited to single-band systems, and its applicability to multiband systems remains unclear. In this paper, we establish the Wiener-Hopf factorization (WHF) of the non-Bloch Hamiltonian as a powerful framework, providing a unified and rigorous foundation for Amoeba analysis in multiband systems. By combining the WHF with Hermitian doubling, we first elucidate the applicability criteria for the generalized Szegö limit theorem in multiband systems. We then show that the WHF provides the natural mathematical origin for the symmetry-decomposed Ronkin function in symmetry class AII$^\dagger$, leading to a rigorous proof of the generalized Szegö limit theorem for these systems and opening a path toward systematic generalizations to other symmetry classes.

Abstract: Nanoscale topologically non-trivial magnetization configurations generate significant interest due to both the fundamental properties of their knotted structures and their potential applications in ultra-efficient computing devices. While such textures have been widely studied in two dimensions, three-dimensional (3D) systems can yield more complex configurations, resulting in richer topologies and dynamic behaviors. However, reliably nucleating these 3D textures has proven challenging, and so far, 3D configurations such as vortex rings and hopfions can often only be observed forming spontaneously in relatively uncontrolled manners. Here, we demonstrate that through the 3D nanopatterning of chiral single crystal helimagnets into nano-tori, the controlled formation of a magnetic double helix can be achieved. This surface-localized topological state is stabilized by the interplay of intrinsic exchange interactions of the single crystal with the extrinsic emergent effects of the patterned geometry. These double helices host magnetic defects akin to supercoiling in circular DNA and climbing vines. We expect this study to serve as a foundation for future research combining single crystal systems with 3D nanopatterning, offering a new degree of control over emergent phenomena in nanoscale magnets and wider quantum material systems.

Motivation: Understanding trion signatures in 2D materials is crucial for studying Coulomb many-body effects and excitonic correlations.

Method:  ARPES-based theoretical analysis of trion signatures in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Result: Trions exhibit mass-dependent spectral shifts, and their shape changes with mass imbalance. Doubling theories this predicts a double-peak structure for mass-imbalanced trions and how these features depend on temperature.

Conclusion: This work establishes a framework for ARPES studies of many-body Coulomb complexes in 2D doped semiconductors and paves the way for experimental identifications of trion states.

Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has recently emerged as a direct probe of excitonic correlations in two-dimensional semiconductors, resolving their dispersion and dynamics in energy-momentum space, including dark exciton states inaccessible to optical techniques. However, the ARPES fingerprint of charged excitons (trions), which plays a key role in all doped and gated 2D material systems, has remained unknown so far. We present a first theoretical analysis of trion signatures in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting how the additional charge carrier modifies the spectral position and shape relative to neutral excitons in ARPES spectra. Interestingly, we further predict that mass-imbalanced trions yield a characteristic double-peak structure, clearly separated in energy and line shape from neutral excitons. The predicted temperature dependence of these features offers guidance for experimental investigations aimed at identifying trionic states, thereby establishing a framework for ARPES studies of many-body Coulomb complexes in doped two-dimensional semiconductors.

Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) through orbital torque (OT) has emerged as a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic devices without relying on heavy metals. While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers. These results provide microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices.

Abstract: Spins in semiconductor quantum dots offer a scalable approach to quantum computing; however, precise control and efficient readout of large quantum dot arrays remain challenging, mainly due to the hyperdimensional voltage space required for tuning multiple gates per dot. To automate this process, large datasets are required for testing and training autotuning algorithms. To address the demand for such large datasets, we introduce RF-Squad, a physics-based simulator designed to realistically replicate radiofrequency (RF) reflectometry measurements of quantum dot arrays, with the ability to go beyond the Constant Interaction Model (CIM) and simulate physical phenomena such as tunnel coupling, tunnel rates, and quantum confinement. Implemented in JAX, an accelerated linear algebra library, RF-Squad achieves high computational speed, enabling the simulation of a 100x100 pixel charge stability diagram of a double quantum dot (DQD) in 52.1 $\pm$0.2 milliseconds at the CIM level. Using optimization algorithms, combined with it's layered architecture, RF-Squad allows users to balance physical accuracy with computational speed, scaling from simple to highly detailed models.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: STEM-EBIC is a powerful imaging technique for studying carrier transport at the nanoscale, but its application to thin TEM lamellae is relatively unexplored. In this study, we used STEM-EBIC to investigate p-n junctions in silicon photodiode lamellae prepared by FIB milling. We observed significant differences in effective diffusion lengths compared to bulk silicon, likely due to surface recombination and FIB-induced surface modifications. Our measurements also revealed deviations from expected diode-like behavior, possibly due to ohmic contacts. This work establishes STEM-EBIC as a quantitative tool for nanoscale carrier transport studies in thin devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to extend the application of STEM-EBIC from bulk materials to thin TEM lamellae, which are increasingly used in nanoscale device studies. Understanding carrier transport at the nanoscale is crucial for advancing nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.

Method: We performed a systematic study using STEM-EBIC on silicon photodiode lamellae prepared by gallium and xenon focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The lamellae were micron-scale, allowing for nanoscale imaging. We directly visualized p-n junctions and measured effective diffusion lengths as a function of local thickness. Current-voltage measurements were also conducted to assess device behavior and compare with simulations and bulk measurements.

Result: The key findings include (1) effective diffusion lengths for electrons and holes that are orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained by SEM-EBIC on bulk silicon, likely due to pronounced surface recombination; (2) FIB-induced surface modifications caused significant deviations from expected behavior; (3) current-voltage measurements showed serious deviations from diode-like behavior, attributed to ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts. This demonstrates that STEM-EBIC can provide quantitative information about carrier transport in nanoscale TEM lamellae.

Conclusion: This study establishes STEM-EBIC as a valuable technique for analyzing carrier transport in nanoscale devices, particularly thin TEM lamellae. Our findings highlight the importance of surface effects and device geometry in interpreting STEM-EBIC results. Future work should focus on optimizing the technique for various materials and device geometries.

Abstract: Electron beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), STEM-EBIC, provides direct access to carrier transport at the nanoscale. While well established in bulk SEM geometries, its application to thin TEM lamellae remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a systematic STEM-EBIC study of silicon photodiode lamellae prepared by gallium and xenon focused ion beam (FIB) milling. We directly visualize the p-n junctions in thin cross sections and extract effective diffusion lengths for electrons and holes as a function of local thickness. The values are orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained by SEM-EBIC on bulk silicon, reflecting pronounced surface recombination and FIB-induced surface modifications. Current-voltage measurements further reveal severe deviations from the expected diode-like behavior, which we attribute to ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts in the emasurement setup. Our analysis establishes STEM-EBIC as a quantitative probe of carrier transport in nanoscale devices.

Abstract: In the case of nonspinning compact binary systems on quasi-elliptic orbits, I obtain the conservative map between the constants of motion (energy and angular momentum) and the fundamental (radial and azimuthal) frequencies at the fourth post-Newtonian order, including both instantaneous and tail contributions. This map is expressed in terms of an enhancement function of the eccentricity, which is appropriately resummed to ensure accuracy for any eccentricity; in particular, I recover known results for circular orbits. In order to obtain this map, the local dynamics are expressed using an action-angle formulation. The tail term is treated as a perturbation, which is first localized in time, then Delaunay-averaged. Both operations require a contact transformation of the phase-space variables, which I explicitly control. Using the first law of binary black hole mechanics, I then obtain the orbit-averaged redshift invariant for eccentric orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order; when properly accounting for the tail contributions, it perfectly agrees with analytical self-force at postgeodesic order [arXiv:2203.13832]. Finally, I use these results to re-express the fluxes of energy and angular momentum obtained at third post-Newtonian order in [arXiv:0711.0302] and [arXiv:0908.3854] in terms of fundamental frequencies.

Abstract: Theories of gravity in which the metric is fundamentally classical predict stochastic fluctuations in the gravitational field. In this article, we study the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation as a starting point to understand the phenomenology of linearised classical-quantum hybrid gravity. In particular, we describe how to compute the non-equilibrium two point function of the scalar field, showing explicitly the role of the initial state in regulating divergences. To do so, we use a "mod-squared-retarded" pole-prescription and find that the covariance in the field is non-zero only outside the lightcone, scales inversely with the spatial distance of the spacetime points and grows linearly in time. The energy has a contact divergence similar to that found in the quantum case. We conclude by discussing possible implications of anomalous diffusion for hybrid theories of gravity, especially looking at the energy density in the predicted gravitational waves background, which can be inferred from the scalar covariances.

Abstract: A model of a two-sheeted universe in the quantum theory of gravity is proposed, based on the definition of 3D invariant and gauge-invariant proper time of the universe. A uniform time in a closed universe is introduced in the class of equivalent reference systems defined by the spectrum of a Hermitian 3D operator on the space of Dirac bi-spinors, the equality to zero of which is equivalent to a system of gravitational constraints. Based on the analogy with the Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory in Minkowski space and the definition of discrete C-, P- and T-transformations separately, the principle of CPT symmetry in a two-sheeted universe is formulated. A covariant quantum theory of matter gauge fields consistent with the charge conjugation operation in a two-sheeted universe is proposed. The CPT symmetric state of a homogeneous isotropic two-sheeted model of the universe is constructed by an iterative method in which the no-boundary Hartle--Hawking wave function is used as a zeroth approximation.

Abstract: We study quantum mechanical wavefunctions near highly curved spaces, i.e., black holes. By utilizing the formalism developed by DeWitt, we derive the Schrödinger equations in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild and the Reissner-Nordström black hole geometries. The quantum electron cloud for the "black hydrogen atom" - an electron trapped by black holes - is particularly studied. We solve the equations and find that black holes generally attract the wavefunctions, localizing them near the horizon where the electrons are most likely to be trapped. These results imply that not only classical objects but also the quantum material and even the chemical properties of the atoms are affected by strong gravity. We also discuss black hydrogen molecules composed of multi-centered Majumdar-Papapetrou black holes.

Abstract: This article deals with a nonrelativistic cosmological model based on Galilean covariance, formulated within a five-dimensional Galilean manifold. Within this framework, we construct an isotropic and homogeneous metric analogous to the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric but without a universal speed limit. Two distinct solutions of the Einstein-like field equations are obtained: (i) a vacuum configuration ($λ=0$) yielding an exponential--quadratic scale factor, and (ii) a dust-dominated universe ($λ=1$) described by a non-interacting nonrelativistic fluid. Upon dimensional reduction to $3+1$ spacetime through a specific embedding, the model naturally develops anisotropy in the scale factor and density, consistent with the near-zero spatial curvature inferred from Planck data. In the case of vanishing spatial curvature, the framework reproduces Milne's Newtonian cosmology because this condition leads to a vanishing pressure. This provides an independent nonrelativistic setting for cosmological dynamics within Galilean covariance.

Abstract: Tachyons are hypothetical particles that propagate faster than light, yet they have never been observed in nature or in the laboratory. In this work, we introduce the hydrogen molecule ion as an analogue for the dynamics of a spinless test particle interacting with the gravitational field generated by a tachyon. The tachyonic spacetime is modeled using an AII metric, and the problem is analyzed through the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field in this background. We compute the quasinormal modes and the Hawking radiation spectrum associated with the system. By introducing an external potential, we demonstrate that both the radial and angular components of the test particles wave function can be effectively reproduced by the electron dynamics in the hydrogen molecule ion, thus proposing a molecular analogue model for an extreme gravitational system.

Abstract: We construct a new family of regular black hole solutions supported by the novel Letelier-Alencar string cloud and regularized through a rational Dagum-type distribution. The regulator smooths the matter profile and ensures finite curvature invariants, yielding a geometry that interpolates between a string-cloud exterior and an anti--de Sitter core. We analyze the energy conditions, identifying where the null, weak, dominant and strong conditions hold or fail across the core and exterior. The parameter space for horizon formation is mapped and the thermodynamic propertie -- mass, Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity -- are derived; notably, the entropy depends only on the regularization scale while the string parameter modifies temperature and heat capacity. Employing Rényi non-extensive entropy and the topological thermodynamics approach, we show the non-extensive deformation stabilizes the system and removes the standard phase transition. Finally, we compute the shadow radius and derive constraints compatible with current Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A* and M87*.

Motivation: Understanding the gravitational wave background provides insights into early宇宙和cosmic evolve astrophysics.,

Method: We use the Euclid Consortium's Flagship Simulation Galaxy Catalogue to predict the gravitational wave contribution from each galaxy's star formation and mass. We combine these contributions to predict the SGWB's frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy.

Result: This analysis presents a framework for correlating the SGWB anisotropy with Euclid's galaxy data, offering a new method to extract astrophysical information through gravitational waves.

Conclusion: This work represents a foundational step in integrating gravitational wave astronomy with galaxy surveys to understand the宇宙背景和大尺度结构.

Abstract: We estimate the amplitude and spatial anisotropy in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) energy density due to compact binary coalescence (CBC) events: binary black holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers. Our starting point is the Flagship Simulation Galaxy Catalogue developed by the Euclid Consortium. For each galaxy in the Catalogue, we use the simulated mass and starformation to constrain the galaxy's star-formation history, and predict its contribution to the gravitational-wave energy density through CBC mergers. Combining such contributions from all galaxies in the Catalogue results in a prediction for the frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy of the CBC SGWB. We also compare this prediction to semi-analytical models of SGWB generated by compact binaries. We identify a set of effective parameters that capture the key features of these models, and we apply a Bayesian framework to infer these parameters assuming an ideal scenario of cosmic variance-limited search. This represents the first step toward developing a comprehensive framework that will eventually enable the correlation of SGWB anisotropy and \textit{Euclid} galaxy data, potentially allowing us to extract valuable astrophysical information from this new observable.

Method: 该研究利用了数值相对论（NR）模拟和黑洞扰urbation理论数据，构建了两个数据驱动模型：gwModel_kick_q200 使用了高斯过程回归，而 gwModel_kick_prec_flow 使用了归一化流模型。

Result: 新的模型显著提高了在特定质量比范围内的预测精度，尤其在极端质量和中等质量比时表现突出，能够更准确地模拟 kick 分布。

Abstract: Modeling the remnant recoil velocity (kick) distribution from binary black hole mergers is crucial for understanding hierarchical mergers in active galactic nuclei or globular clusters. Existing analytic models often show large discrepancies with numerical relativity (NR) data, while data-driven models are limited to mass ratios of q<=8 (aligned spins) and q<=4 (precessing spins) and break down when extrapolated outside their training ranges. Using ~5000 of NR simulations from the SXS and RIT catalogs up to q=128 and ~100 black hole perturbation theory simulations up to q=200, we present two classes of models: (i) gwModel_kick_q200 (gwModel_kick_q200_GPR), an analytic (Gaussian process regression) model for aligned-spin binaries. (ii) gwModel_kick_prec_flow, a normalizing-flow model for kick distribution from precessing binaries with isotropic spins. Our approach combines analytic insights from post-Newtonian theory with data-driven techniques to ensure correct limiting behavior and high accuracy across parameter space. Both gwModel_kick_q200 and gwModel_kick_prec_flow are valid from comparable to extreme mass ratios. Extensive validation shows all three models outperform existing ones within their respective domains. Finally, using both back-of-the-envelope estimates and 1404 detailed star cluster simulations incorporating our kick models, we find that the black hole retention probability in low mass globular clusters can vary noticeably when the gwModel_kick_prec_flow model is employed. The models are publicly available through the gwModels package.

Motivation: Advances in material science and X-ray techniques have led to the development of microfluidic devices tailored for photoexcitation studies, enabling efficient monitoring of structural changes in liquids.

Method: The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, avoiding cleanroom facilities, simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength and X-ray transparency are validated through UV-vis spectroscopy and SAXS measurements, respectively.

Result: The device exhibits multi-wavelength transparency and X-ray transparency, facilitating structural analysis of proteins and studying photoinduced dynamics with temperature-jump and time-resolved pump-probe experiments.

Conclusion: The microfluidic device is a versatile and simplified tool for synchrotron-based photoexcitation studies, demonstrating its potential in structural evolution analysis of liquid samples.

Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of experimentally estimating mutual coupling (MC) in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and presents a reduced-rank MC representation to address this issue. The approach allows for a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy, validated through experiments with a 100-element RIS in different radio environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve the practicality of physics-based optimization of RISs by addressing the experimental challenges in estimating mutual coupling.

Method: The method involves developing a reduced-rank MC representation and validating it experimentally across three different radio environments with varying scattering conditions.

Result: The results show that the reduced-rank MC estimation performs well, with accuracy influenced significantly by the radio environment, and the importance of MC awareness varying with the specific radio environment and performance metric.

Conclusion: This work provides a flexible and efficient solution for estimating mutual coupling in large-scale RISs, demonstrating its effectiveness in different operating environments.

Abstract: Physics-consistent optimization of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is thwarted in practice by the difficulty of experimentally estimating the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. For large RISs, experimental MC estimation is fundamentally challenging because of the quadratic scaling of the number of unknowns with the number of RIS elements. In this Letter, we present a generic and flexible reduced-rank MC representation that allows wireless practitioners to choose a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. We experimentally validate the direct reduced-rank MC estimation for a 100-element RIS in three radio environments (rich scattering, attenuated scattering, free space). We observe a strong environmental dependence of the influence of rank reduction on accuracy. Model-based performance evaluations highlight that the importance of MC awareness in optimization depends strongly on the radio environment and the performance indicator.

Abstract: China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory worldwide, provides a low radiation background environment, which is necessary to frontier scientific research, such as the experimental studies of rare-event physics. Due to the almost filled space of CJPL-I and the requirement of future physics experiments, the construction of the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) was started in 2020 and all finished in 2024. In this work, we report the measured results of major environmental radiation in CJPL-II, including cosmic-ray muons, radon, gamma rays, and neutrons. Results indicate that the rock overburden and the radioactive background control effectively minimize the environmental radiation background. The scientific data presented also serve as an important basis to detector background modeling for the physics experiments in CJPL-II.

Abstract: Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\,\text{m}\times1.8\,\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.
  We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\,μ\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\,μ\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\,μ\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\,μ\text{m}$.
  Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.

  We developed a coaxial wire scanning head to measure and correlate localized high-voltage discharge currents in air with high-resolution surface images. We find that the identified discharge 'hotspots' are transient and show no significant correlation with static visual features. Next, we established a quantitative relationship between artificially induced abrasive surface damage on the wires and a reduction in the discharge inception voltage. This work provides a novel non-invasive tool for qualifying wires dedicated for use in electrodes for future low-background experiments.

Abstract: We study superconformal indices of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetry. The usual representation of the index involves a multi-dimensional contour integral over the BPS spectrum of the free gauge theory. To find a closed form expression for the index, it is natural to attempt a residue evaluation. However, the presence of a non-isolated essential singularity inside the contour prevents a straightforward implementation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by gauge-fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the $\mathcal{N}=4$ Macdonald index, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. The simplified form manifests the strongly coupled BPS spectrum of the Macdonald sector of the theory, and suggests the absence of ``non-graviton'' operators in this sector. We also evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form.

Abstract: We consider hairy, magnetic black brane solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Dilaton theory with full back-reaction of the scalar and gauge fields and compute the time evolution with time dependent sources. The dual field theory's 't Hooft anomaly leads to long-lived current oscillations in the low temperature limit long after the electric pulse which created these modes has been switched off. We find that, generally, non-linear effects increase the decay rates of long-lived modes by a temperature dependent amount. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the life-time of time-translation symmetry breaking states can be made arbitrarily large if the temperature after the quench is sufficiently small. Experimentally this might be realizable in Weyl semimetals.

Motivation: Desaru的DESY-Bootstrap理论模型串在Stretched视界上的模斥也过于浅薄，不充分解释为何视界的邻居区域中含有大量熵。

Method: 纠正了’t Hooft极限模型中的模斥–正模斥过渡的概念错误，从热力学和量子信息理论的角度重新评估了伸缩视界的熵位置。

Result: 正确的结论是熵位于距离视界Planck距离的区域，这意味着和之前的弦距离结论相比，Planck距离为N^{1/2}弦距离。

Conclusion: 伸缩视界的附近区域包含巨大的熵，而伸缩视界的本身作为视界，只是一个量子引力效应的uced视界而且其附近区域的熵才是决定性的因素。

Abstract: A question arises in the holographic description of the static patch of de Sitter space: Where does the entropy reside? The answer of course is in the stretched horizon, but how far from the mathematical horizon is the stretched horizon? In recent papers and lectures I argued that the entropy in DSSYK/JT-de Sitter resides at a string distance from the horizon. That conclusion was based on misconception about the confinement-deconfinement transition in the 't Hooft model. When corrected the right answer is of order the Planck distance (which differs from the string distance by a factor of order $\sqrt{N}).$

Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of one-loop BCJ numerators in Yang-Mills and related theories. Starting from the propagator matrix that connects colour-ordered integrands to numerators, we identify the consistency conditions that ensure the existence of Jacobi-satisfying numerator solutions and determine the unique construction. The relation between one-loop numerators and forward-limit tree numerators is clarified, together with the additional physical conditions required for a consistent double-copy interpretation.
  We propose a two-step expansion strategy for obtaining explicit one-loop numerators. The Yang-Mills integrand is first decomposed into scalar-loop Yang-Mills-scalar building blocks, which are then expanded into bi-adjoint scalar integrands. We derive explicit results for up to three external gluons, showing how the kinematic consistency conditions uniquely determine the coefficients in each case. Similar results for Einstein-Yang-Mills and gravity amplitudes are also presented.

Abstract: We study conformal field theories (CFTs) and their classifications from a modern perspective based on the abstract algebraic formalism of symmetries or conserved charges, known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). By studying the algebraic structure of the SymTFTs in detail, we found a natural generalization of the quantum dimensions associated with (pseudo-)Hermitian systems and (non)-unitary CFTs. These generalized data of SymTFTs provide classifications of massless and massive renormalization group flows, which will describe the quantum phase transitions of the corresponding pseudo-Hermitian systems. Moreover, our discussions straightforwardly enable one to relate a general class of coset constructions or level-rank dualities to domain wall problems between topological quantum field theories (or a series of corresponding quantum phase transitions related to the Higgs mechanism). Our work provides a systematic reduction and classification of algebraic data, symmetries, for pseudo-Hermitian systems based on ideas from established mathematical fields, linear algebra and ring theory.

Abstract: This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive derivation of the Einstein-Maxwell charges and fluxes in the near-horizon region of a four-dimensional non-extremal black hole, with vanishing cosmological constant. Specifically, we present a detailed derivation of the Noether charges within both the metric and first-order formulations, elucidating the relationship between the Carrollian internal boost charge and the Lorentz boost charge. It is well-established in the literature that Carrollian fluids exhibit an internal local boost symmetry; we demonstrate that this symmetry precisely corresponds to a Lorentz internal transformation. Finally, we prove that the near-horizon Einstein equations can be obtained from the flux-balance law by employing the generalized Barnich-Troessaert bracket.

Abstract: We propose a new fermionic sum formula for the Macdonald index for a class of Argyres-Douglas theories. The formula arises naturally from a three-dimensional topological field theory obtained by a twisted dimensional reduction of the 4d theory. Such a reduction often gives rise to a 3d ${\mathcal N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theory that is expected to flow to an ${\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal fixed point. After performing a topological twist, we obtain a 3d TFT admitting boundary conditions that support the vertex operator algebra associated with the original 4d theory. In this framework, the Macdonald index appears as a half-index of the 3d gauge theory, with the Macdonald grading determined by a distinguished $U(1)_A$ symmetry in the infrared ${\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal algebra. We present a general procedure to identify this $U(1)_A$ symmetry and, whenever possible, show that it produces the known prescription for computing the Macdonald index from the refined character of the associated vertex operator algebra. Our construction also gives a hint towards the IR formula for the Macdonald index, from the 4d BPS particles on the Coulomb branch.

Abstract: Mixed oriented and nonoriented center vortices are known to generate nontrivial topological charge. However, most previous analyses have been restricted to Abelian-projected thin configurations. Studies of thick vortices have so far focused on the $SU(2)$ case and on the intersection of a single pair of oriented objects. In this work, we construct mixed oriented and nonoriented thick center-vortex gauge fields in $SU(N)$ with smooth profiles and explicit non-Abelian phases. These phases ensure a smooth interpolation between different Cartan fluxes at monopole junctions. We analyze the resulting topological charge density and visualize its morphology, elucidating the color structures responsible for fractional lumps that together yield a nonvanishing global charge.

Abstract: We study the apparent tension between locality and unitarity for symmetries in quantum field theory. This emerges in the context of categorical symmetries where symmetry operators are generically non-invertible. We argue that locality imposes particular regularities in the action of symmetries on the Hilbert space. This allows us to introduce an observable that can measure the properties of the non-locality for symmetry operators. We study it for a class of examples and demonstrate that this observable can encode data associated to the fusion algebra of symmetries.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct self-gravitating topological solitons in the $SU(N)$ Einstein non-linear sigma model coupled to $ω$-vector-mesons in $D=4$ space-time dimensions. These solutions represent tube-like configurations free of curvature singularities and possess a non-vanishing topological charge identified as the baryon number. We show that, using the maximal embedding Ansatz of $SU(2)$ into $SU(N)$ in the exponential representation, the tubes can be constructed for arbitrary values of the flavor number, $N$, with the topological charge being proportional to this number. The flat limit of this solution, which corresponds to an array of baryonic tubes in a finite volume, is analyzed in detail. Remarkably, although the energy of the solitons at a finite volume is an increasing function of $N$, the binding energy decreases as the number of flavors present in the theory increases, reaffirming that the inclusion of more than two flavors improves the predictions of the model.

Abstract: The non-commutative geometry offers an effective framework for describing physics at the Planck scale, incorporating generic quantum-gravitational effects through an intrinsic minimal length and the $κ$-deformed space-time stands out as a particularly well-developed model based on a Lie-algebraic type non-commutative space-time structure. We investigate the inflationary paradigm and the associated primordial perturbations within the framework of $κ$-deformed non-commutative space-time. By constructing a scalar field theory invariant under the $κ$-Poincaré algebra, we derive the deformed oscillator algebra for the field modes of the primordial perturbations resulting in the non-trivial scale dependent modification of both the scalar and tensor power spectra. Further, we compute the corresponding $κ$-deformed corrections to the scalar spectral index and its running, finding that the $κ$-deformation naturally provides a higher value for spectral index which offers a potential resolution to the discrepancy between the values reported by PLANCK and ACT. Finally we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using the latest ACT DR6 data, constraining the $κ$-deformed non-commutative length scale to $λ=2.17^{+2.33}_{-1.53}\times 10^{-30}m$ at the $1σ$ confidence level, suggesting the precision cosmology as a powerful probe of quantum gravity phenomenology.

Abstract: We investigate the high-energy, small-angle limit of two-body gravitational scattering. Using power counting arguments and dispersion relations in an effective field theory for the Regge regime, we derive the general loop expansion that determines how the leading Regge logarithms and their complex structure arise as a power series in $t/s$. Focusing on the tower of multi-H diagrams that govern the leading logarithmic behavior, we compute the leading double logarithm at four loops (5PM) using both effective field theory methods and the multi-Regge expansion, finding complete agreement. Finally, using the aforementioned dispersion relations, we extract the single logarithmic contribution to the imaginary part of the eikonal phase at 5PM in the Regge limit.

Abstract: We implement the Gauge Theory Bootstrap (GTB) framework, initiated by He and Kruczenski in arXiv:2309.12402 and arXiv:2403.10772, using a discrete basis parametrization of the 2-to-2 pion scattering S-matrix, the spectral densities and the form factors. This approach enables a refined analysis of the convergence of the GTB and drastically reduced computational time --from approximately half an hour in arXiv:2403.10772 to under one minute in ours. The discrete basis also facilitates the evaluation of the S-matrix across the complex sheet resulting, in additional of the dominant $ρ(770)$ and $f_2(1270)$ resonances identified in arXiv:2403.10772, in the extraction of the $σ$ meson pole located far from the real axis.

Abstract: Jordanian deformations offer rare integrable realisations of non-AdS holography, whose solvability methods differ from conventional AdS/CFT examples. Here we study the $\mathfrak{sl}(2,R)$ sector of the Jordanian deformed $AdS_5\times S^5$ string and its weak-coupling spin chain counterpart: the $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ model with a non abelian Jordanian Drinfel'd twist. While the twist breaks the usual highest-weight structure that underlies conventional Bethe ansätze, we show that the complete spectrum remains solvable within the Baxter framework. We argue that the functional form of the $TQ$-relation is unchanged, yet the structure of the $Q$-functions is nontrivially modified. This allows us to obtain analytic expressions at arbitrary spin chain length $J$, which match the deformed string spectrum at the one-loop level and to subleading order in the large-$J$ expansion, despite the severely reduced symmetry. Our results provide nontrivial tests of the Jordanian AdS/CFT correspondence and lay the groundwork for implementing the Separation of Variables program in non-abelian Drinfel'd-twisted models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  the author is addressing fundamental issues in lattice gauge theory, specifically fermionic doubling and the structure of the standard model.

Method:  the study introduces a new interpretation of Kähler-Dirac spinors on a two-sheeted spacetime, utilizing PT symmetry or i↔−i to resolve inconsistencies in the Lagrangian and avoid negative norm states.

Result:  the proposed framework involving KD fields on a two-sheeted spacetime with PT symmetry or i↔−i successfully resolves the fermionic doubling problem and provides a new perspective on the standard model by simplifying fermionic terms and suggesting connections to CPT symmetry.

Conclusion:  this paper presents a radical approach to lattice gauge theory, offering a novel solution to long-standing problems and potentially shedding light on the CPT symmetry of the universe.

Abstract: Kähler-Dirac (KD) spinors have generated excitement in the lattice gauge theory community, as a way to (i) deal with the ``fermion doubling" problems that plague ordinary (Dirac, Majorana, or Weyl) spinors when discretized on a lattice, and (ii) help explain the structure of the standard model. But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields have the ``wrong sign" Lagrangian, and give rise to negative norm states. Here we propose a new resolution/interpretation: the KD field actually lives on a two-sheeted spacetime, with the sheets related by $PT$ symmetry or, alternatively, by $i\leftrightarrow-i$. And, to avoid any unphysical interactions between the two sheets, the KD field obeys a reality condition (which we call the ``KD-Majorana condition"), which forces every particle on one sheet to be accompanied by a mirror (anti-)particle on the other sheet. We discuss how the standard model fits in this framework, how the fermion (kinetic and Yukawa) terms simplify, and how it may relate to the CPT-symmetric universe model.

Abstract: Contemporary understanding of thermalization in quantum field theory stems largely from understanding properties of transient excitations of equilibria. These nonhydrodynamic excitations are known to structurally differ between weakly- and strongly-coupled quantum field theories with no known results at intermediate values of the interaction strength. We demonstrate that all the known behaviors of transient excitations can be understood as a consequence of different realizations of a symmetry principle, the shift symmetry, applied at the level of the far from equilibrium generalization of the hydrodynamic effective action that we explicitly construct. Our approach naturally includes the effects of stochastic fluctuations outside the hydrodynamic regime and allows to explicitly construct hybrid models interpolating between weak- and strong-coupling behavior. We study properties of one such model motivated by thermalization in nuclear collisions in light of the QCD running coupling.
