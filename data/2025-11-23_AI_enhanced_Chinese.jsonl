Comments are welcome", "summary": "We propose a class of periodically driven (Hermitian) modified bosonic Kitaev chains that effectively hosts rich nonHermitian Floquet topological phenomena. Two particular models are investigated in details as case studies. The first of these represents a minimal topologically nontrivial model in which nonHermitian skin effect, topological zero modes, and topological $\u03c0$ modes coexist. The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $\u03c0$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model. Our studies thus demonstrate the prospect of a periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chain as a starting point in exploring various nonHermitian Floquet topological phases through the lens of a Hermitian system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7269\u7684Hermitian\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u73bb\u8272\u5b89\u5fb7\u68eeKitaev\u94fe\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u975eHermitian Floquet\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u975eHermitian \u8fb9\u7f18\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u03c0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u03c0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u5f15\u5165 onsite\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u7b49\u6270\u52a8\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7269\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u975eHermitian Floquet\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u8d77\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u548c Floquet \u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u6210\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u975eHermitian Floquet\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u62d3\u6251\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8 onsite\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u65e0\u5e8f\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u8fb9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u540e\uff0c\u5176 Robustness\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975eHermitian \u8fb9\u7f18\u6548\u5e94\u80fd\u591f\u88ab onsite\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u65e0\u5e8f\u76f8\u4e92\u6291\u5236\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8be5\u7279\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u90a3\u4e48\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7269 bosonic Kitaev\u94fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u975eHermitian Floquet\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u7684Hermitian\u4f53\u7cfb\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, as a step toward realizing this technology, we demonstrate selective two-dimensional shuttling of electrons across a helium film condensed on the surface of a CMOS control chip. The electrons are moved in packets containing, on average, several tens down to single electrons. We perform CCD-style electron shuttling in any of 128 transport microchannels, each of which links electron storage zones and sensing zones in the 2D plane. Shuttling sequences can be repeated at least 10$^9$ times with no detectable electron loss.

The most mature material platform is magnetically doped topological insulators. In these materials, precise quantization is limited to low temperatures, with the activation energy for dissipative transport typically in the range of 1 K. One potential source of dissipative transport is non-chiral edge states. These states are expected to be present in sufficiently thick samples. In this work, we perform extensive Hall and non-local resistance measurements in a Hall bar geometry at 2 K. By comparing 15 independent transport measurements to different transport models, we find that the system behavior is well-described by a simple continuum Ohm's law model. The addition of non-chiral edge states into the model does not significantly improve the fitting, and we conclude that there is not strong evidence for these states.

Additionally, the theory recovers the Gork'ov-Melik-Barkhudarov correction to the superfluid gap and critical temperature, which are key features of superfluid helium. These results validate the proposed renormalization scheme and its ability to describe low-energy phenomena in Fermi fluids.", "conclusion": "The research presents a novel renormalization scheme for Fermi fluids that constructs Landau quasiparticles through an energy cutoff and a unitary transformation. The effective Hamiltonian derived from this scheme unifies the interaction function and collision amplitude, providing a comprehensive description of low-energy physics in both normal and superfluid phases. The theoretical predictions regarding the speed of zero sound and the superfluid gap corrections are in agreement with known results, demonstrating the validity and applicability of the proposed method to studying interacting Fermi fluids."}}

Our experimental results further reveal that the twist angle induces a synergistic evolution between lattice symmetry and topological characteristics, enabling the mutual transformation and stable coexistence of different skyrmion family members within a single system.

In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials.

To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency.

Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \\textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\\gg L$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the plate structure is easily damaged during long-term service or when it is impacted by foreign objects. Such a damage may lead to serious safety accidents. Beamforming and L-shaped sensor cluster (LSSC) localization method can be used to locate the damage on the plate. However, when using beamforming or LSSC localization method to locate the damages on plate-like structures, there exists blind area. In this paper, by combining the beamforming and LSSC localization method, a fan-shaped sensor cluster is proposed through arranging five sensors in a fan shape, which can effectively reduce the blind areas. The positions of damages on the plate can be accurately detected by using two groups of fan-shaped sensor clusters and one sensor for transmitting the excitation signal. The feasibility of the fan-shaped sensor cluster localization method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments, and the results are compared with those obtained by using the T-shaped sensor cluster. The results show that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can more accurately identify the damages at different positions.

While it is commonly attributed to conformational rearrangements, the underlying dynamical mechanisms remain poorly understood. The contact cluster model of allostery [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 10731] identifies localized groups of highly correlated contacts that mediate interactions between secondary structure elements. This framework proposes that allostery proceeds through a multistep process involving cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters, transmitted through rigid secondary structures. To demonstrate the validity and generality of the model, this Perspective employs extensive molecular dynamics simulations ($\\sim 1\\,$ms total simulation time) of four different photoswitchable PDZ domains and studies how different domains, ligands and perturbations influence both the contact clusters and their dynamical evolution. These analyses reveal several recurring clusters that represent shared flexible structural modules, such as loops connecting $\u03b2$-sheets, and show that the characteristic timescales of the nonequilibrium protein response can be directly associated with the motions of individual contact clusters. Thus, the dynamic decomposition of PDZ domains into contact clusters uncovers a modular, dynamics-based architecture that underlies and facilitates long-range allosteric communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u89e3\u6790\u4e0d\u540cPDZ\u9886\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u89e3PDZ\u5757\u4e3a\u63a5\u89e6\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u86cb\u767d\u95f4\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7ec6\u81f4\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5982PDZ\u9886\u57df\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u6790\u5176\u8c03\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u8c03PDZ\u9886\u57df\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u3001\u914d\u4f53\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u63a5\u89e6\u96c6\u7fa4\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u53ef\u6a21\u8033\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5982\u03b2-\u87ba\u65cb\u95f4\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u73af\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u86cb\u767d\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5355\u4e2a\u63a5\u89e6\u96c6\u7fa4\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u6790\u86cb\u767d\u95f4\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u52a8\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

This measurement is performed via detection of electrons and protons in delayed coincidence using custom large-area segmented silicon drift detectors. We present the characterization of one such detector system to establish the proton energy and timing response, using a dedicated proton accelerator. The detected proton peak was studied for 25 keV, 30 keV, and 35 keV incident protons on a set of detector segments and multiple cooling cycles over a one year period. Ionization losses were consistent with models of the detector dead layer with thicknesses less than 100nm. The detected proton peak was stable within the uncertainty from energy calibration (0.2 keV). The rise times of detector pulses from $^{109}$Cd and $^{113}$Sn conversion electron sources were used to extract the impurity density profile and establish a precise model for the detector timing response. The observed impurity density profile varied from $(2 \\pm 2) \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the center to $(26 \\pm 2) \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the edge. This impurity density profile was then used to characterize systematic effects in proton time-of-flight measurements due to detector pulse-shape effects; the resultant proton timing systematic uncertainties were below 0.3 ns, which is sufficient for the Nab experiment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7845\u5fae\u5dee\u5206 detector\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u81ea\u7531\u4e2d\u5b50\u03b2\u8870\u53d8\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aCKM\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "CKM\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u8d28\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u03b2\u8870\u53d8\u901f\u7387\u7684\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u662f\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u5206\u6bb5\u7845\u5fae\u5dee\u5206\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u4e2a Proton\u80fd\u8c31\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6563\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684 Proton\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u54cd\u5e94\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u5e74\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u652f\u6301\u5176\u7528\u4e8eNab\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aNab\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9CKM\u77e9\u9635\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002"}}

Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological \"pins\" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales.

Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches.

A plastic scintillating fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact, high-resolution solution. However, scaling up the detector area and spatial resolution demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, this work presents a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the selection of suitable diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. Electronic tests show that the proposed design exhibits low crosstalk among electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range spanning a few to several hundred photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further demonstrate that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to direct readout. These results verify that the proposed method offers a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles. These results reveal that dissipative coupling cooperativity carries a clear physical meaning and serves as a key parameter for controlling phase transitions.

This method also motivates a simple variational solution which yields the lowest energy known to date ($0.6812$ in the same units) to arise out of an analytical variational solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\uff0c\u7531\u4ea4\u53c9\u6c9f\u69fd\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ca1\u6709\u52bf\u9631\u5374\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5728\u5fae\u7eb3\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u96c5\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u4e3a0.659606\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u53d8\u5206\u89e3\u5f97\u51fa\u66f4\u4f180.6812\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This is borne out in the mathematics, where mixed state algorithms have always required more sophisticated techniques to design and analyze than pure state algorithms. We present a new approach to tomography demonstrating that, contrary to this belief, state-of-the-art mixed state tomography follows easily and naturally from pure state algorithms.\n  We analyze the following strategy: given $n$ copies of an unknown state $\u03c1$, convert them into copies of a purification $|\u03c1\\rangle$; run a pure state tomography algorithm to produce an estimate of $|\u03c1\\rangle$; and output the resulting estimate of $\u03c1$. The purification subroutine was recently discovered via the \"acorn trick\" of Tang, Wright, and Zhandry. With this strategy, we obtain the first tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal in all parameters. For a rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state, it uses $n = O((rd + \\log(1/\u03b4))/\\varepsilon)$ samples to output an estimate which is $\\varepsilon$-close in fidelity with probability at least $1-\u03b4$. This algorithm also uses poly$(n)$ gates, making it the first gate-efficient tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal even in terms of the dimension $d$ alone. Moreover, with this method we recover essentially all results on mixed state tomography, including its applications to tomography with limited entanglement, classical shadows, and quantum metrology. Our proofs are simple, closing the gap in conceptual difficulty between mixed and pure tomography. Our results also clarify the role of entangled measurement in mixed state tomography: the only step of the algorithm which requires entanglement across copies is the purification step, suggesting that, for tomography, the reason entanglement is useful is for consistent purification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The commonly assumed power law form $a(t)=\u03b2t^\u03b1$ is shown to generate multiple solution branches, many of which can be considered to be 'unphysical', atleast to hold true globally, for all times. A hybrid solution, $a(t)=Ct^\u03b1e^{Dt^\u03b2}$ emerges in the special case $g_1=0$, where the quadratic Riemann-Cartan term vanishes.

Because standard OT configurations do not provide direct access to the axial position, axial detection typically relies on temporal fluctuations in forward-scattered optical power to infer the position of the particle. This approach generally assumes a linear-response regime in which the signal arises from the interference between the forward scattered and the nonscattered optical fields; however, under certain conditions, the backward-scattered contribution becomes non-negligible, leading to deviations from the linear response. Here, we present a simple yet comprehensive model for axial detection in standard OT while explicitly accounting for the backward-scattered field.

Temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data reveal a distinct magnetic behavior in monolayers as compared to thicker samples.

The experimentally constructed phase diagram for monolayer NiPS3 matches theoretical predictions from the six-state clock and 2D-XY models incorporating hexagonal anisotropy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4van der Waals\u5316\u5408\u7269NiPS3\u4e2d\u7684\u6297\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u5bfc\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u5c42\u7cfbNiPS3\u5448\u73b0\u516d\u91cd\u949f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4XY\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u78c1\u76f8\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "van der Waals\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u4f7f\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u78c1\u884c\u4e3a\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728NiPS3\u7684\u5c42\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u6297\u94c1\u78c1\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u88c5\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u78c1\u5bfc\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u548c\u78c1\u7535\u963b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5355\u5c42\u4e0e\u591a\u5c42NiPS3\u7684\u78c1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u5c42NiPS3\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u78c1\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u516d\u91cd\u949f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u516d\u65b9\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u8fdb\u5165\u4e8c\u7ef4XY\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u67f1\u72b6\u78c1\u6027\uff1b\u591a\u5c42NiPS3\u4ec5\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u78c1\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5355\u8f74\u538b\u7f29\u78c1\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aUnderstanding\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u78c1\u76f8\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, its deployment in non-cooperative gas sensing remains challenging because conventional implementations require cooperative reflectors or well-controlled optical returns. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing a computational sensing scheme based on a mode-programmable optical comb and a high-sensitivity single-pixel detector. In our approach, a two-dimensional disperser and a high-speed digital micromirror device encode individual comb modes, enabling broadband, mode-resolved spectral acquisition without relying on coherent detection. This architecture supports measurements through highly scattering media and from non-cooperative targets while retaining the core advantages of frequency-comb spectroscopy. Our method achieves picometer-level spectral resolution, a 10-nm (1.27-THz) instantaneous bandwidth, single-photon sensitivity down to 10^-4 photons per pulse, and compressed spectral acquisition with 2.5% sampling for <10% reconstruction error.

We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes. In particular, we show that the diffraction integral matches exactly the eikonal limit of the scattering amplitude at lowest post-Minkowskian order, after a change in coordinates and the inclusion of finite-distance effects. We further extend the standard formalism by including subleading corrections to the post-Minkowskian and eikonal approximations.

An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\\hbar$ units. Even as $\\hbar \\rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition. This implies that Bohr's correspondence principle is not fundamental, but a consequence of practical limitations.

The solver replaces standard neural activation functions with Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and supports both soft -- via loss penalties -- and hard -- enforced by analytic masks -- implementations of Leaver's normalization. Benchmarking against Leaver's continued-fraction method shows cumulative (real+imaginary part) relative frequency errors of $\\sim 0.001\\%$ for the separated formulation with hard normalization, $\\sim 0.1\\%$ for both the soft separated and soft joint formulations, and $\\sim 0.01\\%$ for the hard joint case. Exploiting our ability to solve the joint equation, we add a small quadrupolar perturbation to the Teukolsky operator, effectively rendering the problem non-separable. The resulting perturbed quasinormal modes are compared against the expected precision of the Einstein Telescope, allowing us to constrain the magnitude of the perturbation. These proof-of-concept results demonstrate that hybrid spectral-PINN solvers can provide a flexible pathway to quasinormal spectra in settings where separability, asymptotics, or field content become more intricate and high accuracy is required.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recently, we demonstrated that the low-energy behavior of this system can be captured by a spin-charge-entangled screening process with an \\(A\\otimes N\\) boundary condition. Here, we investigate the evolution of both the screening cloud and the boundary condition in the presence of competing terms that could break either the spin-charge-entangled \\({\\rm SU}_{\\bf L}(2)\\) rotation symmetry or the topological degeneracy. We introduce a temperature-dependent spatial integral of the screening cloud, which can be obtained from the numerical renormalization group. This quantity serves as a proper observable that unambiguously captures the properties of the screening process across temperatures. A clear crossover from conventional Kondo spin screening to spin-charge-entangled screening is observed. Taking into account the overlap between Majorana zero modes, the \\(A\\otimes N\\) boundary condition reduces to a normal one, yet the spin-charge-entangled screening is protected by the \\({\\rm SU}_{\\bf L}(2)\\) symmetry. On the other hand, perturbation that breaks the \\({\\rm SU}_{\\bf L}(2)\\) symmetry can destroy the screening singlet, while leaving the low-temperature \\(A\\otimes N\\) boundary condition intact.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Furthermore, we establish the f-sum rule for the heat magnetic moment that facilitates its experimental detections.

While for general systems we can only establish saturation in the limit of small precursors, we provide evidence that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model there is a precise correspondence between Krylov complexity and (the square of) Nielsen complexity for a finite range of precursors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Krylov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0eNielsen\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9Krylov\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3aNielsen\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95e8\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0eKrylov\u5ea6\u91cf\u517c\u5bb9\u7684Nielsen\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002Hermitian\u7b97\u5b50\u7684Krylov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5\u6052\u7b49\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u524d\u9a71\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u9635\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u3002\u8be5\u957f\u5ea6\u4e5f\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8eNielsen\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5c0f\u524d\u9a71\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u9971\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5728Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev(SYK)\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cKrylov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0eNielsen\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u6709\u9650\u524d\u9a71\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6709\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22Krylov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0eNielsen\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Krylov\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3aNielsen\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95e8\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9002\u5f53\u7684Nielsen\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKrylov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0eNielsen\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u5728\u5c0f\u524d\u9a71\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u5173\u7cfb\u8fbe\u5230\u9971\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728SYK\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u6709\u9650\u524d\u9a71\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

How to efficiently test their quantumness at these scales? We show that the violation of Macrorealism (MR), being the fact that classical systems possess definite properties that can be measured without disturbances, provide a fruitful avenue to this aim. The No Disturbance Condition (NDC) - the equality used here to test MR - can be violated by two consecutive parity measurements on $N$ qubits and found to be independent of $N$ under ideal conditions. However, realistic noisy QCs show a quantum-to-classical transition as $N$ increases, giving a foundationally-motivated scalable benchmarking metric. Two methods are formulated to implement this metric: one that involves a mid-circuit measurement, probing the irreversible collapse of the wavefunction, in contrast to the reversible entanglement generated in the other. Both methods are designed to be clumsiness-loophole free: the unwanted classical disturbances are negligible within statistical error. Violation of MR is detected on a IBM QC up to $N = 38$ qubits, increasing $N$ by one order of magnitude over best known results of MR. Two QCs are benchmarked using the proposed NDC metric, showing a three-fold improvement in their quantumness from one generation to the next.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

I establish this correspondence by constructing explicit mappings between physical fermionic operators and the fields of the symplectic fermion theory. I further explore the implications of this correspondence in two spatial dimensions, where the symplectic fermion theory is a logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge $c=-2$. In the corresponding $(2+1)$-dimensional systems, I identify anyonic excitations originating from the underlying symplectic fermion theory, even though the Hamiltonian is gapless. Transporting these excitations along non-contractible loops generates transitions among topologically degenerate ground states, in close analogy with those in topologically ordered phases.

However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language.

Each module or trap can perform only one operation at a time, resulting in low intra-trap parallelism, but there is no restriction on operations happening on independent traps, enabling high inter-trap parallelism. Unlike their superconducting counterparts, the design space for QCCDs is relatively flexible and can be explored beyond current grid designs. In particular, current grid-based architectures significantly limit the performance of many promising, high-rate codes such as HGP codes and BB codes, suffering from numerous trap to trap ``roadblocks\", forcing serialization and destroying the inherent parallelism of these codes.. Many of these codes are highly parallelizable, meaning that with appropriate hardware layouts and matching software schedules, execution latency can be reduced. Faster execution, in turn, reduces error accumulation from decoherence and heating, ultimately improving code performance when mapped to realistic hardware. To address this, we propose Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign that departs from traditional 2D grids in favor of a flexible ring topology, where ancilla qubits move in lockstep. Cyclone eliminates roadblocks, bounds total movement, and enables high levels of parallelism, resulting in up to ~4$\\times$ speedup in execution times. With HGP codes, Cyclone achieves up to a 2$\\times$ order of magnitude improvement in logical error rate, and with BB codes, this improvement reaches up to a 3$\\times$ in order of magnitude.Spatially, Cyclone reduces the number of required traps and ancilla qubits by $2\\times$.The overall spacetime improvement over a standard grid is up to $\\sim 20 \\times$, demonstrating Cyclone as a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional 2D QCCD architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign for modular trapped-ion quantum computing hardware (QCCDs), aiming to significantly enhance performance by eliminating roadblocks, improving parallelism, and reducing the number of traps and qubits required.

Remarkably, this feature emerges not only for positive GUP parameter but also for negative GUP parameter. From the initial acceleration, we deduce that the negative GUP parameter is more preferable. We also obtain maximum Hubble parameter from the first Friedmann equation, indicating a universe without initial singularity.

Conventional approaches--such as chemical doping, lattice strain, or external gating--offer robust stability but remain confined to the quasi-static regime, far from the intrinsic femto- to picosecond dynamics that govern many-body interactions. Here, using cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, we realize dynamic bandgap engineering in the anisotropic topological insulator $\u03b1$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with unprecedented micro-electron-volt ($\u03bc$eV) precision. The exceptional sensitivity arises from the cooperative action of long-lived topological carriers, stabilized by restricted bulk-to-edge scattering phase space, together with symmetry-resolved coherent phonons that modulate inter-chain hopping. These channels jointly modify Coulomb screening and interband transitions, enabling both gradual and oscillatory control of the electronic structure. Supported by first-principles and tight-binding theory, we further demonstrate a dual-pump coherent control strategy for continuous, mode-selective tuning of electronic energies with $\u03bc$eV accuracy.

Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u6709U(1)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u7b26\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d7\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9075\u5faa\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7b97\u7b26\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7b97\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u7b26\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7b97\u7b26\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7b97\u7b26\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u4e0e\u7b97\u7b26\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89d2\u5ea6\u52a8\u91cf\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u66f4\u52a0\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u800c\u89d2\u5ea6\u52a8\u91cf\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u5219\u76f8\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3002\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u589e\u957f\u7531\u89d2\u5ea6\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u51cf\u5c0f\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51fa\u65f6\u5e8f\u65e0\u5e8f\u7b97\u7b26\u7ea0\u7f20\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u0127xd\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b97\u7b26\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f97\u51fa\u7b97\u7b26\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9075\u5faa\u5361\u65b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u7b97\u7b26\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u5927\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0b\u53d1\u6563\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u3002"}}

This paper presents a numerical study of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) hybrid III-V-on-silicon lasers, analyzing design trade-offs and optimization strategies based on supermode theory. The III-V section of the design incorporates InAs/(Al)GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which offer improved temperature insensitivity at the cost of more complex III-V/Si optical coupling, due to the high refractive index of (Al)GaAs. Consequently, many current laser designs rely on silicon waveguides with a thickness exceeding 220 nm, which helps coupling but limits their compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. To address this challenge, we perform detailed simulations focusing on 220-nm-thick silicon waveguides. We first examine how the mode profiles jointly depend on the silicon waveguide dimensions and the geometry and composition of the III-V stack. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel epitaxial design that enables effective III-V/Si coupling, with the optical mode strongly confined within the III-V waveguide in the gain section and efficiently transferred to the silicon waveguide in the passive sections. Moreover, the final design is shown to be robust to fabrication-induced deviations from nominal parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.\n  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114).

Most theoretical works to date rely on the brute-force exact diagonalization which is limited to the one partially occupied band. In this work, we present strong evidence that the effect of higher lying bands cannot be ignored due to strong interband interactions. To tackle these effects, we introduce a non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, originally developed for problems in quantum chemistry. We apply this methodology to twisted MoTe2 at fractional hole fillings of \u03bd = 1/3 and 2/3 across a spectrum of twist angles. Our results show that at \u03bd = 1/3, the many-body excitation energy gaps are substantially reduced compared to the one-band treatment. For \u03bd = 2/3, we find that the dynamic correlations stemming from interband interactions stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, consistent with the experimental findings. By examining the correlated orbitals and their single-particle topological features, we demonstrate that this stabilization at higher twist angles arises predominantly from the dynamic correlations, rather than conditions on the single-particle quantum geometric tensor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u626d\u66f2 MoTe2 \u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5c42_band \u7684 brute-force \u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u5c42\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u6270urbative \u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u5206\u7ec4\uff08DSRG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u626d\u66f2 MoTe2 \u5e76\u5728\u5206\u6570\u586b\u6ee1\u5ea6 \u03bd = 1/3 \u548c 2/3 \u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u8f6c\u52a8\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728 \u03bd = 1/3 \u65f6\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u6fc0\u53d1\u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u800c \u03bd = 2/3 \u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u5206\u6570 Chern \u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u53ca\u5176\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5e0c\u671b\u6269\u5c55\u5355\u5c42_bands \u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b how multiple layers interact.", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u975e\u6270urbative \u7684 Drsr \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u626d\u66f2 MoTe2 \u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684 Drsr \u8d77\u6e90\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8f6c\u52a8\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6570\u586b\u6ee1\u5ea6\u7684\u72b6\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5982\u4e0b\u51e0\u70b9\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a1. \u5728 \u03bd = 1/3 \u65f6\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u6fc0\u53d1\u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u30022. \u5728 \u03bd = 2/3 \u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u5206\u6570 Chern \u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u30023. \u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8de8\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165 Drsr \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

Stage I solves carrier-population and current equations at a single point, driven by a chirped super-Gaussian pulse. By fixing bandwidth and normalizing for intensity, we isolate a chirp-only response of plasma density, which exceeds unity and shows a consistent advantage for negative over positive chirp. Stage II propagates the field in water via the angular-spectrum method and applies the same equations across space. Normal dispersion reverses the trend: the chirp-only plasma density decreases as chirp grows, negative chirp remains less detrimental, and suppression is strongest for longer FTL pulses (e.g., 80 fs) due to dispersion-induced temporal spreading and spatio-temporal desynchronization.

The sensitivity of the quantum sensing depends on how precisely spin observables can be determined in the measurement, and is intrinsically limited by the uncertainties of the observables. The use of a spin-squeezed state in a quantum sensor can reduce the uncertainty below the standard quantum limit when combined with an appropriate measurement procedure. Here, we discuss the simulation study of the generation of a squeezed state in an interacting spin system. We show that a spin system coupled by the magnetic dipole interaction can create a squeezed state. Model systems to realize the spin squeezing experimentally are also discussed. In addition, we find that a squeezed state is a type of entangled state.

Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Ne\u00e9l order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53cc\u5b50\u5c42\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u578b\u7d27\u5bc6\u6bd4 bindings\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u53cc\u5b50\u5c42\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u578b\u7d27\u5bc6\u6bd4 bindings\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u6bd4 bindings\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u7684 {10,3} \u548c {14,3} \u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 spring \u7578\u53d8\u8c03\u6574\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u548c\u6b21\u8fd1\u90bb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684 hopping \u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u63015-\u548c7-\u73af\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f74\u5411\u78c1\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728 spring \u7578\u53d8\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u53cc\u5b50\u5c42\u6750\u6599\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 spring \u7578\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u53cc\u5b50\u5c42\u6750\u6599\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002"}}

To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lov\u00e1sz number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lov\u00e1sz number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families.

The analysis focuses on three independent components: the rate at which neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits energy in the surrounding region, the geometric contribution to the phase accumulated by neutrino mass eigenstates, and the modifications to flavor conversion produced by weak gravitational lensing. Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector. The numerical results show that the Lorentz-violating deformation substantially increases the efficiency of the annihilation channel, produces characteristic shifts in the oscillation phase not present in earlier bumblebee configurations, and reshapes the angular dependence of the lensing-induced flavor transition pattern.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here we propose theoretically and illustrate experimentally a different approach to the construction of HOTIs. This approach utilizes lattices with incomplete unit cells and achieves localized modes of topological origin across a broader parameter space. When truncation disrupts translational symmetry by cutting through the interior of multiple unit cells, boundary modes in our system emerge for both trivial and topologically nontrivial positions of the Wannier centers. We link these modes to the appearance of fractional Wannier centers. We also demonstrate that linear boundary states give rise to rich families of stable solitons bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity. Multiple types of thresholdless topological solitons with different internal symmetries are observed in waveguide arrays with triangular configurations featuring incomplete unit cells for any dimerization of waveguide spacings.

We propose that this composite flow corresponds to the inward motion of a spacelike boundary from the asymptotic infinity of dS spacetime, traversing the cosmological horizon and approaching the worldline of a static observer.

The first is based on a real gas, fluid-like temperature, $T_{RG}$, while the second corresponds to a relativistic species-like temperature, $T_{RS}$. We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $\u03b1$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \\emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $\u03b6\\leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u901a\u80c0\u4e2d\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u573a\u548c\u5927\u573a\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0ePlanck\u7ea6\u675f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6700\u5408\u7406\u7684\u901a\u80c0\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u3002\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0$T_{RS}$\u662f\u6700\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5728\u901a\u80c0\u671f\u95f4\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728Jordand\u548cEinstein\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0$T_{RS}$\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c inflaton\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u8303\u5fb7\u534e Like \u7b49\u6e29\u7ebf\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u80c0\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u53d8\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u53d8\u89e6\u53d1\u4e86\u901a\u80c0\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5c0f\u573a\u52bf\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u5766\u52bf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002Starobinsky\u548c\u03b1-\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\u3002\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u8026\u5408\u503c$\u03b6 \neq 1/6$\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u901a\u80c0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u53d8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u754c\u9650\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u91cd\u5408\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u80c0\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8865\u5145\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u901a\u80c0\u673a\u5236\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u73af\u8282\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u80c0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u5c0f\u573a\u548c\u5927\u573a\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u5c0f\u573a\u548c\u5927\u573a\u52bf\u4e2d\uff0c$T_{RG}$\u548c$T_{RS}$\u5404\u81ea\u9002\u7528\uff1b2) $T_{RS}$\u5728\u901a\u80c0\u671f\u95f4\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u6027\uff1b3) $T_{RS}$\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06inflaton\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u53d8\u5173\u8054\u8d77\u6765\uff1b4) $T_{RS}$\u5728coupling\u503c$\u03b6\neq1/6$\u65f6\u624d\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u6027\uff1b5)\u81ea\u7136\u901a\u80c0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u6709\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u754c\u9650\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u91cd\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u5c0f\u573a\u548c\u5927\u573a\u52bf\u4e2d\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002$T_{RS}$\u662f\u81ea\u6d3d\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u7b26\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e14\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u6027\u3002$T_{RS}$\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06inflaton\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u53d8\u5173\u8054\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u80c0\u673a\u5236\u3002$\u03b6\neq1/6$\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u6027\u3002\u81ea\u7136\u901a\u80c0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u6709\u5f3a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u754c\u9650\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u884c\u8303\u56f4\u91cd\u5408\u3002"}}

Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields.

We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles.

We reveal that the MSSW soliton originates from the dipole gap mechanism with a unique comb-like frequency spectrum caused by the four-magnon process. By varying the microwave power, we find significant changes in soliton periods linked to the spin wave dispersion renormalization.

The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion.

Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moir\u00e9 superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity.

We demonstrate an all-optical terahertz (THz) attoclock that reconstructs electron dynamics during photoionization by detecting THz radiation emitted from gases ionized by the fundamental and second harmonic two-color laser fields, without the need for photoelectron detection. The polarization direction of the emitted THz field reflects the direction of the photoelectron drift velocity and thus encodes the effective delay. By measuring the THz waves from argon atoms ionized by the two-color fields, and by precisely controlling their relative phase and ellipticity, we observe intensity-dependent rotations of the THz polarization direction. Both experiment and time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulations reveal that the effective delay extracted from the THz polarization direction decreases with increasing laser intensity, consistent with conventional photoelectron attoclock results. Our experiment establishes the feasibility of the THz attoclock as a contactless probe of tunneling dynamics, with promising applications to condensed matter systems where photoelectron detection is impractical.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Moreover, by integrating two thermo-optic phase shifters, we achieved both resonance tuning and dynamic control of the Q factor. This capability makes the device highly versatile for applications requiring dynamic spectral control, such as tunable filters, gyroscopes, and sensors.", "AI": {"tldr": "achieving tunable racetrack resonator using FLM with Q factor 8e5 and tunability via thermo-optic phase shifters for applications like tunable filters,gyroscopes and sensors", "motivation": "improving photonic devices integration through FLM and tunable resonators for robust optical and fluidic applications", "method": "fabrication of tunable racetrack resonator using FLM with low-loss waveguides and integration of thermo-optic phase shifters for Q factor tuning", "result": "developed a tunable resonator with Q factor 8e5 and tunability for various applications", "conclusion": "FFL provides versatile tunable resonators with significant Q factor and tunability for optical and fluidic use cases"}}

This means that quantum corrections to general relativity become necessary not at the Planck scale, as the majority of researchers in the field think, but at the Schwarzschild scale, in agreement with recent interesting results in the literature.

However, conventional tunable laser systems often rely on mechanical actuation, which limits their tuning speed, stability, and repeatability. Alternative tuning methods, such as adjusting the temperature of the gain medium or the injection current, are either slow or suffer from unwanted coupling between frequency and intensity. Electro-optic modulators implemented after the laser offer fast frequency tunability but these components are bulky and prone to high insertion losses. Here, we introduce an external cavity semiconductor laser that achieves ultrafast frequency and amplitude tunability within a compact footprint without any moving parts. The laser employs a resonant electro-optic metasurface as the external mirror, providing narrowband feedback that enables simultaneous single-mode operation and voltage-controlled tuning across a wide range of currents. Leveraging a narrow linewidth design, we demonstrate mode-hop-free linear frequency tuning with rates of up to 70 THz/s, and frequency excursions reaching 110 MHz under a 10 V peak RF drive, clearly surpassing rates attainable through mechanical actuation. Moreover, by biasing the laser near its threshold, our platform enables intensity modulation with an efficiency above 100% at a peak voltage of 4 V.

In this article, we explore universal charging behaviors of free fermion quantum batteries across quantum phase transitions. We first analyze a Dirac cone-like model to extract general features. Then, we verify our findings by means of two relevant lattice models, namely the Ising chain in a transverse field and the Haldane model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5145\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u7684\u5145\u7535\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5145\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5145\u7535\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f7f\u7528Dirac\u9525\u6a21\u578b\u548cIsing\u94fe\u3001Haldane\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u5bf9\u7535\u6c60\u5145\u7535\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5145\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u5bf9\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u5145\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Manuel", "Liliana Arrachea"], "title": "Lindbladian approach for many-qubit thermal machines: enhancing the performance with geometric heat pumping by entanglement", "comment": "31 pages", "summary": "We present a detailed analysis of slowly driven quantum thermal machines based on interacting qubits within the framework of the Lindblad master equation. By implementing a systematic expansion in the driving rate, we derive explicit expressions for the rate of work of the driving forces, the heat currents exchanged with the reservoirs, and the entropy production up to second order, ensuring full thermodynamic consistency in the linear-response regime. The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \\ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change.

In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes.

In the near-coincidence limit, using Riemann normal coordinates, the action reduces to a string worldsheet action in a curved background that naturally includes the symmetric spacetime metric, an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field, and a dilaton. The Kalb-Ramond field gives rise to a string charge density, from which we demonstrate that bit threads can be exactly reproduced. This correspondence provides a clear physical interpretation of bit threads. Exploiting this correspondence, we establish explicit relations between the emergent string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface, providing new insights into entanglement entropy. In particular, entanglement entropy can be computed from open string charge, while Bekenstein-Hawking entropy arises from closed string charge through open-closed string duality. These results suggest a unified picture in which the Susskind-Uglum conjecture, open-closed string duality, and the ER=EPR proposal emerge as equivalent manifestations of the same underlying principle.

We introduce Medusa, an automated compilation method for lowering a circuit's failure rate. Medusa uses flags to predict the absence of high-weight errors. Our method can numerically upper bound the failure rate of a circuit in the presence of flags, and fine tune the fault-tolerance of the flags in order to reach this bound. We assume the flags can have an increased fault-tolerance as a result of applying surface QECs to the gates interacting with them. We use circuit level depolarizing noise to evaluate the effectiveness of these flags in revealing the absence of the high-weight stabilizers. Medusa reduces the cost of quantum-error-correction (QEC) because the underlying circuit has a lower failure rate. We benchmark our approach using structured quantum circuits representative of ripple-carry adders. In particular, our flag scheme demonstrates that for adder-like circuits, the failure rate of large-scale implementations can be lowered to fit the failure rates of smaller-scale circuits. We show numerically that a slight improvement in the local fault-tolerance of the flag-qubits can lead to a reduction in the overall failure rate of the entire quantum circuit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc).

In this work, we investigate the impact of atom loss in long chains of trapped ions. Even though this is a relatively rare event, ion loss in long chains must be addressed because it destabilizes the entire chain resulting in the loss of all the qubits of the chain. We propose a solution to the chain loss problem based on (1) a quantum error correction code distributed over multiple long chains, (2) beacon qubits within each long chain to detect the loss of a chain, and (3) a decoder adapted to correct a combination of circuit faults and erasures after beacon qubits convert chain losses into erasures.

Within this framework, we analyse the role of measurement incompatibility and establish its quantitative effect on attainable precision. We achieve this by deriving upper bounds based on the pretty good measurement -- a notion originally developed for hypothesis testing -- combined with the evaluation of the Nagaoka-Hayashi lower bound. In general, we prove that, as in the many-copy regime of local estimation theory, incompatibility can at most double the minimum loss relative to the idealised scenario in which individually optimal measurements are assumed jointly implementable. This result implies that, in many practical situations, the latter may provide a sufficient and computationally efficient benchmark without solving the full optimisation problem. Our results, which we illustrate through a range of applications, including discrete quantum phase imaging, phase and dephasing estimation, and qubit sensing, provide analytical and numerical tools for assessing ultimate precision limits and the role of measurement incompatibility in Bayesian multiparameter quantum metrology.
