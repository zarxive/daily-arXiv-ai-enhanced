In this work, we demonstrate a scalable, low-damage method to integrate high-quality polycrystalline diamond films on (010) $\u03b2$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), enabled by dielectric interlayers and polymer-assisted electrostatic nanodiamond seeding. A systematic investigation of processing conditions was conducted to assess their effects on film morphology, grain evolution, sp3-phase purity, and optical characteristics. Diamond films grown at 800 degC exhibit grain sizes up to 126.6 nm, RMS roughness of 16.3 nm, and a sharp diamond Raman peak at around 1332 cm-1 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 34.98 cm-1. The corresponding sp$^3$-phase purity exceeds 97.5 percent, with an optical bandgap up to 5.13 eV. Deposition time variation from 10 to 60 minutes at 800 degC results in thicknesses from 53 nm to 315 nm and corresponding grain coarsening. Interlayer comparison reveals that SiO2 yields slightly larger grains and higher purity than SiNx under identical conditions. Notably, films with more than 96 percent sp$^3$ content were achieved at temperatures as low as 480 degC, confirming the compatibility of this approach with reduced thermal budgets.

It also relates the electron density and atomic forces to the variation of the energy with the external potential. But the HK map is rarely utilized in atomistics, wherein interatomic potentials are defined using the molecular or crystal structure rather than the external potential. As a break from this tradition, we present a field theoretic atomistics framework where the external potential assumes the central quantity. We machine learn the HK energy map while satisfying the thermodynamic limit. Further, we obtain both forces and electron density from the variation of the HK energy map, that are exact relations.

However, most modern measurement approaches cannot retrieve these parameters easily, often relying on bulky and expensive hardware, or lacking the capability for single-shot sensing. Here, we introduce a compact, snapshot, low-cost, fully vectorial field sensor based on an inkjet-printed nematic liquid crystal droplet array to measure these properties. Polarization and intensity are measured via division-of-wavefront polarimetry, exploiting the droplets' spatially varying birefringence, while the phase is reconstructed by treating each droplet as a microlens in a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor configuration.

The reflecting matter wave can interfere with the incident wave to form a detectable pattern, and this pattern contains information about atom-surface interactions at micrometer scales. We discuss how such an interferometer could be used to probe for anomalous short-range forces that are predicted by some beyond-standard model theories. We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps.

Using Dirac's commutator--Poisson equivalence, the BEB supplies an information backreaction on the GUP--deformed bracket; at saturation the residual uncertainty in a sector cancels, enabling \\emph{operational} simultaneity of conjugate expectations and resolving the EPR tension without hidden variables. A single self-consistency then fixes intrinsic confinement scales: the full (linear$+$quadratic) GUP reproduces the hydrogen Bohr radius (electron) and the proton charge radius (hydrogen nucleus). The same correspondence predicts an information--controlled crossover from a short--distance complex (evanescent) regime to an emergent real (Lorentzian) regime, with a symmetry flow from complex $SU(4)$ frames to $SO(1,3)$; under scale transmutation the short--distance $SU(4)$ is repurposed as the Pati--Salam $SU(4)_c$.

Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\\nabla T_y / \\nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u6c27\u5316\u949b\u6676\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u548c\u672a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9ad8\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u70ed hall \u89d2\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u5e8f\u6676\u4f53\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u9000\u706b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65e0\u5e8f\u6676\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u6a2a\u5411\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u5e76\u975e\u7531\u58f0\u6ce2\u5e73\u5747\u81ea\u7531\u7a0b\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u91d1\u5c5e\u548c\u7edd\u7f18\u7aef\u70b9\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u65c1\u8def\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6676\u683c\u56fa\u6709\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u65e0\u5e8f\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u573a\u666f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684 phonon \u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5fae\u89c2\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 SrTiO3 \u6676\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u70ed hall \u89d2\u548c\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u548c\u5e94\u53d8\u5bf9\u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u70ed hall \u89d2\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u5e8f\u6676\u4f53\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u9000\u706b\u540e\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u6a2a\u5411\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u58f0\u6ce2\u5e73\u5747\u81ea\u7531\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e0e\u7edd\u7f18\u7aef\u70b9\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u65c1\u8def\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": " phonon \u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\u662f\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u65e0\u5e8f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u7b80\u5355\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u6ce2\u5e73\u5747\u81ea\u7531\u7a0b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u70ed hall \u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u5904\u7406\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u65b9\u5f0f\u65e0\u5173\u3002"}}

One standard way to achieve super-resolution is by structuring the phase of the field illuminating the object. Although super-resolution techniques are already employed in commercial imaging devices, intense research efforts continue to enhance the resolution even further. In this work, we show that if the field illuminating the object is structured in the azimuthal coordinate--such as a field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--the azimuthal features of the object can be imaged with enhanced imaging resolution.

We show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, is sufficient to generate the same $\u03b8$ driven criticality. Starting from a Keldysh formulation, we derive an open system nonlinear $\u03c3$ model (NL$\u03c3$M) for class A with a topological $\u03b8$ term but no Cooperon sector, and we demonstrate that nonperturbative instantons still govern a two parameter flow of $(\u03c3_{xx},\u03c3_{xy})$. Evaluating $\u03b8$ in a dephasing quantum anomalous Hall setting, we predict a quantum Hall critical point at $\u03c3_{xy}=1/2$ with finite $\u03c3_{xx}$ the hallmark of the integer quantum Hall universality class realized without Anderson localization. Boundary driven simulations of the Qi_Wu_Zhang model with local dephasing confirm this prediction and provide an experimentally aligned protocol to extract $(\u03c3_{xx},\u03c3_{xy})$ from Hall potential maps.

Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K. At this temperature, electron mobility is three orders of magnitude higher than at approximately 4.0 K, which is the temperature we initially proposed for the LHe TPC.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the development of a single-phase Liquid Helium (LHe) time projection chamber (TPC) for direct dark matter detection.

The research team built a prototype TPC and successfully operated it between 2020 and the present. They encountered event overlap issues due to the long scintillation lifetime of helium and addressed this by experimenting with different helium temperatures. Their system was able to maintain single-phase operation, demonstrating that such a design is feasible.", "result": "The key finding is that maintaining liquid helium at 1.0 K significantly improves electron mobility, which was three orders of magnitude higher than at 4.0 K.

We discuss tunneling out of a generic localized initial state in this picture and present its application for the important example of a resonance state in a one-dimensional point particle potential. We find that the steadyon picture indeed reproduces existing results obtained using the WKB method. Our analysis furthermore demonstrates how applying this picture to physical states naturally addresses open conceptual questions regarding this framework. Finally, we perform a numerical study for a specific potential. We demonstrate in particular the existence of regimes in which the tunneling rate is dominated by higher resonances, rather than the false vacuum, as well as their importance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7a33\u6001\u56fe\u666f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u3002Using this picture\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u521d\u59cb\u5c40\u90e8\u6001\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u70b9\u7c92\u5b50\u52bf\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7a33\u6001\u56fe\u666f\u4e0eWKB\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6700\u80fd\u6001\u6001\u56fe\u666f\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u6001\u81ea\u7136\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u52bf\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u80fd\u6001\u53cd\u800c\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982WKB\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u3001 thrill these\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b9e\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u7684 Recent developments, \u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u548c WKB \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u70b9\u7c92\u5b50\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u96a7\u9053\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u6001\u56fe\u666f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u52bf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u6001\u4e0b\u5bf9\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u6001\u56fe\u666f\u4e0eWKB\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b tunneling\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7a33\u6001\u56fe\u666f\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f53 tunneling \u53d1\u751f\u65f6\uff0c\u8f83\u9ad8\u80fd\u6001\u53cd\u800c\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7a33\u6001\u56fe\u666f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 tunneling \u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u80fd\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6001\u56fe\u666f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52bf\u573a\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982WKB\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f83\u9ad8\u80fd\u6001\u5bf9 tunneling \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u5047\u8a00\u7a7a\u7a74\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Two electrolytic models are presented, both within the HNC approximation. The first one is a two-components mixture representing a primitive-like model of sodium chloride, where the solvent is described as a dielectric continuum. This popular model has the advantage of simplicity, as the ions densities solely depend on spatial coordinates. Additionally, we develop a realistic three-components electrolyte model, in which water solvent is described by a third density field that depends on both spatial and orientational coordinates. The proposed methodology and its tridimensional implementation (3 spatial coordinates and 3 Euler angles) are validated by comparing the solvation properties of a sodium cation with the predictions of integral equation theory solved in 1D (1 intermolecular distance and 5 Euler angles), showing near-perfect agreement. This methodology enables the study of solvation properties of solutes of arbitrary shapes in electrolytic solutions, as demonstrated with the prototypical N-methylacetamide molecule immersed in both electrolytic solution models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6eb6\u5242\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5e7f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u6eb6\u6db2\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7HNC\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5177\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u4e09\u7ec4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ef4\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6eb6\u5242\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u6eb6\u6db2\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408HNC\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u7ec4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u7ec4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6eb6\u5242\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65b9\u5411\u5750\u6807\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9e\u65bd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec3\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\u548c3\u4e2a\u6b27\u62c9\u89d2\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ef4\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ef4\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6eb6vation\u6027\u8d28\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e09\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\u6eb6\u8d28\u5728\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6eb6\u5242\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u6eb6\u6db2\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) is a leading solution, forming a spectrogram by scanning the delay between two pulse replicas and recording the nonlinear signal spectrum. In online settings, however, dense delay-frequency scans are costly or impractical-especially for long pulses, wavelength regimes with limited spectrometer coverage (e.g., UV), or hardware with coarse resolution, yielding severely undersampled FROG traces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle in this regime-iterative algorithms are computationally heavy, convolutional networks blur fine structure, and sequence models are unstable when inputs are discontinuous or sparse. We present a generative diffusion framework tailored to recover ultrafast pulse intensity and phase from incomplete FROG measurements. Our model infers missing spectro-temporal content with high fidelity, enabling accurate retrieval from aggressively downsampled inputs. On a simulated benchmark of FROG-pulse pairs, the diffusion approach surpasses strong CNN and Seq2Seq baselines in accuracy and stability while remaining efficient enough for near real-time deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "A generative diffusion framework is introduced for recovering ultrafast pulses from incomplete FROG data, outperforming existing methods.", "motivation": "Accurate characterization of ultrashort laser pulses is vital for scientific and technological progress, yet this task is hindered by the need for high-quality pulse characterization data.

To be published in New Journal of Physics", "summary": "We propose atom interferometers based on quantum droplet (QD), which is also being reported as a superior platform for interferometry. The emphasis has been given to harmonic-oscillator (HO) or ring-shaped potentials. In the HO trap, a Gaussian barrier induces coherent splitting; in the ring, one or two barriers guide the splitting and subsequent recombination. The atom number and relative mean-field interaction strength critically affect the interferometric performance. The transmission-coefficient analysis identifies values of the barrier parameters for the balanced $50:50$ splitting. The post-recombination atom-number imbalance serves as a sensitive indicator of the relative phase between merging daughter QDs.

The center of the trapped cloud is determined by absorption imaging and compared for opposite polarities of the quadrupole. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the displacement of the cloud depends on both the field's direction and magnitude. By analyzing this shift under polarity reversal, we infer the two transverse components of a homogeneous external magnetic field relative to the imaging axis, without requiring spectroscopic interrogation. Assuming micron-scale position sensitivity and typical magnetic field gradients, the method enables resolution at the milli-Gauss level. It is compatible with standard cold-atom setups and offers a practical tool for field compensation in magnetically sensitive experimental stages. As such, it establishes a bridge between traditional macroscopic magnetic field probes and atomic-physics-based precision sensors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, its performance is critically dependent on the selection of the circuit depth a parameter that must be specified a priori without clear guidance. In this paper, we introduce a variant of QAOA called dynamic depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DDQAOA) that resolves the challenge of pre selecting a fixed circuit depth. Our method adaptively expands circuit depth, starting from p = 1 and progressing up to p = 10, by transferring learned parameters to deeper circuits based on convergence criteria. We tested this approach on 100 instances of the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) at 10 qubit and 16 qubit scales. Our DDQAOA achieved superior approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations than the standard QAOA for p = 3, 5, 10, and 15. In particular, while standard QAOA at p = 15 achieved results close to our approach, it used 217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 qubit and 16 qubit instances, respectively.

Here, we present experimental results obtained from a peculiar in-situ TEM device, which was prepared with the aim to analyze the relationship between (thermo)electric properties and specific crystal orientations of a misfit layered compound. The formation of a nano-sized gap at a grain boundary facilitated a precisely controllable mechanical bending of the device by application of differential heating currents. The devices' electrical properties were found to be substantially influenced by the gap, leading to a high intrinsic voltage. This voltage additionally depends on the vacuum environment and on the history of applied heating currents. These findings are largely attributed to the presence of adsorbed molecules within the gap region. The electrical in-situ TEM studies of this work illustrate that interior surfaces can strongly influence electrical properties even under high vacuum conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper demonstrates the use of in-situ TEM to study the relationship between electrical properties and crystal orientations in a misfit layered compound, highlighting the influence of a nano-gap formed at a grain boundary and adsorbed molecules.", "motivation": "The study aims to investigate how mechanical bending due to differential heating currents affects electrical properties of a misfit layered compound, possibly revealing insights into the role of surface adsorption in electrical behavior.", "method": "In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the device under study, measuring electrical properties and analyzing surface adsorption.", "result": "The presence of a nano-sized gap facilitated mechanical bending, leading to a high intrinsic voltage influenced by the gap size, vacuum conditions, and heating current history.

However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\\sim\\!300$ nm lateral and $\\sim\\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo.

Here we present a new concept towards lead screening using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) in an unconventional geometry we coin transmission XRF in which the sample is placed between the source and detector. For cost reduction, we then show that $^{241}$Am found in ionizing smoke detectors is spectrally suitable for Pb L-shell XRF generation and can thus replace X-ray tubes used in conventional XRF devices. Exploring soil screening as the first application, we demonstrate with Monte Carlo simulations that a configuration with 7$\\times$ $^{241}$Am sources and a standard silicon drift detector can enable screening-relevant detection limits (100 ppm Pb) in soil within practical measurement times (<30 min).

With a suitable change of variables, we derive new differential equations and full analytical solutions for generic tree graphs, making it trivial to take the folded limit and partial-energy limit at a vertex. Our result shows that folded tree graphs generally involve functions of smaller transcendental weights than their nondegenerate counterparts.

In this study, we introduce an alternative approach based on the geometric stability of three-dimensional singularity line shapes, demonstrating that shape-based tracing of singularities outperforms both topological and spectral methods in turbulence. To test this concept, we propose Flower Beams, a novel class of structured optical fields featuring controllable petal-like singularity morphologies. We construct an 81-element optical alphabet and classify these structures after turbulence using deep learning. Our findings reveal that shape-based tracing achieves classification accuracy exceeding 90% in the weaker turbulence regimes and remains highly competitive even in stronger turbulence, significantly outperforming spectral and topology-based approaches.

These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables.

The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Ln3ScBi5\u6676\u4f53\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u7684Pr3ScBi5\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6df7\u5408\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Low-dimensional physics\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u65b0\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u673a\u6750\u6599\u9886\u57df\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLn\u5143\u7d20Pr3ScBi5\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "Pr3+\u79bb\u5b50\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4 Kagome \u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5171\u7ebf\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u5f31\u5c42\u5185\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u7ef4\u5f26\u72b6\u94fe\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5f3a\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6750\u6599\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u78c1\u6027 frustration\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7 RKKY \u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5bfc\u7535\u7535\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u6df7\u5408\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 effect \u548c\u78c1\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The induced OAM originates from the adiabatic evolution in which electrons dynamically acquire Berry phase. By introducing a tight-binding model with p orbitals on a honeycomb lattice, we show a microscopic picture that chiral phonons modulate orbital overlaps of electrons, and calculate the generated OAM, whose sign depends on phonon chirality. We then construct an effective model for valley phonons with different phonon pseudoangular momenta (PAM) and identity their distinct intervalley-scattering channels. Our model obeys the selection rule between phonons and electrons with the orbital degree of freedom. Extending this framework to d-orbital electrons, our model is applied to describe the induced OAM in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results reveal a direct lattice-OAM transfer mechanism that emerges even in materials with weak spin-orbital coupling, opening a new promising way for orbitronics applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8f74\u5fc3\u58f0\u5b50\u7684adiabatic\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efap\u8f68\u9053\u5728\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u6676\u683c\u7684\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u8f74\u5fc3\u58f0\u5b50\u8c03\u8282\u7535\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u7b26\u53f7\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u58f0\u5b50\u7684\u53cc\u8f74\u5fc3\u6027\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c they\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u8f74\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 Valley-\u58f0\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u901a\u9053\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9075\u5faa\u53cc\u8f74\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u8f68\u9053\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u5230d\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e09\uacb9\u91d1\u5c5e Wooden \u6c2a\u5316\u7269\u4e2d\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53cc\u8f74\u6548\u5e94\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u5b50\u52bf\u5728\u5fc5\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u58f0\u5b50\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u6a21\u578b\u548c Berry \u76f8\u4f4d\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u58f0\u5b50\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u5b50\u5e73\u6ed1\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u53cc\u8f74\u5fc3\u58f0\u5b50\u5728\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5f31\u53cc\u8f74\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u4ecd\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4f20\u9012\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u58f0\u5b50\u5728\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

This is essential for achieving precise three-dimensional tracking of the interaction products and enabling accurate particle-flow reconstruction. Organic scintillator detectors, for example, in the form of scintillating fibres, offer sub-millimetre spatial and sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. However, such systems introduce significant challenges in construction and demand a large number of readout electronics channels, leading to extremely high costs that are difficult to mitigate. In this article, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of elementary particles that leads to ultrafast three-dimensional high-resolution imaging in large volumes of unsegmented scintillator. The key enabling technologies are plenoptic systems and time-resolving single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array imaging sensors. Together, they allow us, for the first time ever with a plenoptic camera, the reconstruction of the origin of single photons in the scintillator, thereby facilitating an event-by-event analysis. A case study focused on neutrino detection demonstrates the unique potential of this approach, achieving full event reconstruction with a spatial resolution on the order of two hundred micrometres. This work paves the way for a new class of particle scintillator-based detectors, whose capabilities should be further enhanced through future developments and expanded to Cherenkov light detection and calorimetry at collider neutrino experiments, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as applications such as medical imaging and fast neutron detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u673a\u95ea\u70c1\u6750\u6599\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u4e09\u7ef4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528plenopic\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4resolved SPAD\u9635\u5217\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5149\u677f\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u4f53\u79ef\u672a\u5206\u6bb5\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5efa\u8bbe\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5fae neutrino\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u7c92\u5b50\u5185\u8f90\u5c04\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6750\u6599\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528plenopic\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4resolved SPAD\u9635\u5217\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6210\u50cf\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\u65e0\u9700\u5206\u5149\u677f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7plenopic\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u03bd\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7ea6200\u5fae\u7c73\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5149\u677f\u6280\u672f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u73af\u5f62\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae neutrino\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u65e0\u7d20\u53cc decay\u63a2\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u672a\u5206\u6bb5\u7684\u6709\u673a\u95ea\u70c1\u6750\u6599\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u8d85\u5feb\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $\u03b4B\\sim 10\\,\u03bc{\\rm T}- 1\\,{\\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise.

In this study, we propose a novel spectroscopic approach to directly detect the geometric phase using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) enhanced by strong light-matter interactions within an optical cavity. Focusing on a prototypical pentacene dimer undergoing singlet fission, we model the nonadiabatic wave packet dynamics as it evolves through a CI between electronically excited states. The optical cavity enables dynamic modulation of the coupling between the optical field and molecular vibrational modes, allowing precise control over the wave packet pathways. Importantly, we identify a cancellation in the spectral amplitude, arising from phase differences accumulated along different trajectories, which serves as a clear spectroscopic manifestation of the geometric phase (GP). This cavity-enhanced 2DES framework not only enables direct observation of GP effects but also offers a versatile platform for probing ultrafast nonadiabatic processes.

We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases.

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories.

Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR).

The target nanowire is illuminated via the fiber, and the local absorption of light heats the wire, causing a change in its resistivity. Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is monitored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorption and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber-SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision. The response is robust to variations in the angle and height of the fiber, providing an alternative or complement to fiber-to-chip alignment methods based on the back-reflection or transmission measurement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u4fbf\u7684\u5149\u7ea4\u5bf9\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50lle\u6548\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668(SNSPD)\u7684\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u5438\u6536\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u70ed\u6548\u5e94\u8fdb\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u7535\u963b\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u5149\u7ea4\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9501\u76f8\u653e\u5927\u5668\u76d1\u6d4b\u7535\u963b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5149\u5438\u6536\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5149\u7ea4\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u4ef0\u89d2\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709back-reflection\u6216transmission\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8865\u5145\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u5149\u7ea4\u4e0e\u5149\u7535\u5668\u4ef6\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 HOME\u6548\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684back-reflection\u6216transmission\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9\u5149\u7ea4\u548c\u9776\u4ef6\u7684\u5b89\u88c5\u6761\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c setup \u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u4fbf\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5149\u7ea4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u5149\u675f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5149\u5438\u6536\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u7535\u963b\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5149\u7ea4\u6ed1\u52a8\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9501-in amplifier\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u7684\u7535\u963b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5efa\u7acb\u5149\u5438\u6536\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u7535\u963b\u53d8\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5149\u7ea4\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5149\u7ea4\u5b89\u88c5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u4ef0\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272:\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5149\u7ea4\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b80\u4fbf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u524d\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u95e8\u69db\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709back-reflection\u548ctransmission\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u5408\u9700\u9891\u7e41\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c setup\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u70ed\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7b80\u4fbf\u5149\u7ea4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u7535\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5c55\u671b\u5728\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668(SNSPD)\u7b49\u5149\u7535\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify the quantum group $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{s} \\mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{s} \\mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{s} \\mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{s} \\mathfrak{l}(2, \\mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective.

Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples.

The finite element calculation is done in Schwarzschild coordinates, following a large and scalable number of mass elements in interaction with each other through elastic forces derived from a potential energy function and with the spacetime geometry. After the fact, we analyze the dynamics using a local Fermi coordinate system, computing (1) the deviation of the center of mass of the body relative to the initial marginally-bound orbit, (2) changes in orbital and spin angular momenta, and (3) the decrease in orbital energy and accompanying deposition of energy into internal elastic dynamics.

Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption.

The theory is validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe, where we find that the effective Rashba parameter obtained is smaller than previously reported values for the same material. Incorporating these parameters into a drift-diffusion model, we show that the generated charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect, rather than by the spin or orbital Hall effects. Our work redefines the spin- and orbit-to-charge interconversion coefficients in terms of directly measurable observables, encouraging the community to revisit these processes in other quantum materials lacking inversion symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5230\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hall\u6548\u5e94\u548cRashba-Edelstein\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8f\u89c2\u89c2\u5bdf\u91cf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u5728\u7535ropy\u4f53Te\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u7075\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u503c\u5c0f\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u5230\u6f02\u79fb-\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7535\u8377\u7535\u6d41\u4e3b\u8981\u7531Rashba-Edelstein\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u4e2d\u6709\u6216\u8f68\u9053Hall\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5230\u7535\u8377\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u80fd\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u793e\u533a\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53cd\u8eab\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d44\u6599\u4e2d\u91cd\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u662f\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d44\u6599\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5230\u7535\u8377\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Hall\u6548\u5e94\u548cRashba-Edelstein\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u7535ropy\u4f53Te\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u63d2\u5165\u6f02\u79fb-\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRashba-Edelstein\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u7535\u8377\u7535\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u5728\u7535ropy\u4f53Te\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hall\u6548\u5e94\u548cRashba-Edelstein\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5230\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u30022. \u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6750\u6599\u7279\u6027\u65e0\u53d8\u5316\u30023. \u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u5230\u6f02\u79fb-\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u660eRashba-Edelstein\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u7535\u8377\u7535\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6ca1\u6709\u53cd\u8eab\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5230\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d44\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u6027\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

This produces an infinite dimensional subregion Hilbert space, a non-trivial modular Hamiltonion, and a UV-divergent entanglement entropy that is a universal feature of local quantum field theories. In this work, we appeal to the combinatorial quantization of Chern Simons theory to define a purely topological notion of a subregion. The subregion operator algebras are spaces of functions on a quantum group. We develop a diagrammatic calculus for the associated $q$-deformed entanglement entropy, which arise from the entanglement of anyonic edge modes. The $q$-deformation regulates the divergences of the QFT, producing a finite entanglement entropy associated to a $q$-tracial state.

This representation enables the construction of a numerically exact Floquet propagator that captures the non-Markovian open system dynamics, thus providing a dissipative analogue to the Floquet Hamiltonian of driven isolated quantum systems. We apply this method to study the asymptotic heating of a reservoir in spin-boson models, characterizing the deviation from equilibrium conditions. Moreover, we show how a local driving of two qubits can be utilized to stabilize a transient entanglement buildup of the qubits originating from the interaction with a common environment.

As an illustration of the robustness of the estimate, we use it to establish energy boundedness for solutions to the wave equation on stationary and axisymmetric metrics which are merely $C^1$ close to a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime.

At small bias voltages, the tunneling occurs with conservation of energy and momentum at the points of intersection between two relatively shifted Fermi circles. Here, we experimentally found and theoretically described signatures of electron-hole asymmetric band structure of BLG: since holes are heavier, the tunneling conductance is enhanced at the hole doping due to the higher density of states. Another key feature of BLG that we explore is gap opening in a vertical electric field with a strong polarization of electron wave function at van Hove singularities near the gap edges. This polarization, by shifting electron wave function in one BLG closer to or father from the other BLG, gives rise to asymmetric tunneling resonances in the conductance around charge neutrality points, which result in strong sensitivity of the tunneling current to minor changes of the gate voltages. The observed phenomena are reproduced by our theoretical model taking into account electrostatics of the dual-gated structure, quantum capacitance effects, and self-consistent gap openings in both BLGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bilayer graphene (BLG) tunneling conductance is enhanced at hole doping and exhibits asymmetric resonance behavior when subjected to vertical electric fields.

The defect is modeled by assigning complex-valued hopping amplitudes to the edges that connect the site corresponding to the mean position of the initial delocalized state to its nearest neighbors. We find that this single defective site is sufficient to enhance the ballistic spreading of an initially Gaussian wave packet. Extending these results, we implement a time-dependent alternation protocol between two distinct defect configurations, each individually yielding poor propagation of the state. The combination of these two unfavorable configurations improves the transport efficiency of the quantum walker, revealing a manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in CTQWs with delocalized initial states. This study provides new insights into the role of complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols in CTQWs, demonstrating that the interplay between quantum interference and graph engineering can effectively enhance quantum transport in discrete lattices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u5355\u4e2adefect\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u91cf\u5b50 walks (CTQWs)\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u3002defect\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u6001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9644\u8fd1 site \u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u7684 hopping amplitude \u8d4b\u4e88\u590d\u6570\u503c\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e2a single defective \u8db3\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u521d\u59cb\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce2\u5305\u7684 ballistic \u5206\u5e03\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4e24\u4e2adefect configurations\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a individually \u90fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4f20\u64ad\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec4\u5408\u540e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86CTQWs\u4e2d\u5e15\u5c14 condon's paradox \u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u590d\u76f8\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7CTQWs\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50 walks\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u5f15\u5165defect\u5bf9\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53d1\u73b0\u5e15\u5c14 condon's paradox\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 walks\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684CTQWs\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684hopping amplitude\u6765\u6a21\u62dfdefect\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6ce2\u5305\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u66ff\u4e24\u4e2adefect configurations\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u518d\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f93\u8fd0\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e2adefect\u8db3\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u521d\u59cb\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce2\u5305\u7684ballistic \u5206\u5e03\u3002\u4ea4\u66ff\u4e24\u4e2adefect configurations\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50walk\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5e15\u5c14 condon's paradox\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u590d\u76f8\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 walks\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u76f8\u4f4ddefect\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50walk\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4e0e\u56fe\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86CTQWs\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

For the coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we prove that the linearized operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is essentially self-adjoint and that curvature and field strengths decaying faster than $r^{-3}$ act as relatively compact perturbations, while decay exactly at $r^{-3}$ places $0\\in\u03c3_{\\mathrm{ess}}(\\mathcal{L})$ through delocalized zero modes. This threshold mechanism unifies the infrared behavior of spin-1, spin-2, and mixed spin-$(1\\oplus2)$ fields, linking the onset of spectral delocalization with the appearance of gravitational and electromagnetic memory. Finite-difference simulations corroborate the analytic scaling and reproduce the characteristic quadrupolar and dipolar sky maps predicted for the coupled memory fields.

In Mellin space these actions become finite-difference (shift) operators in the Mellin variables, which we use to extend our results to arbitrary integer spin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u5929\u4f53\u6885\u6797\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u83b7\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eecderive\u4e86\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u6885\u6797\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u4e3a1\u548c2\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\uff08\u5747\u4e3a\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u9053\u7684OPE\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5929\u4f53OPE\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb1\u7535\u6d41\u548c\u81ea\u65cb2\u5e94\u529b\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u3002\u5916\u90e8\u573a\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u65f6\uff0c\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u7531\u81ea\u65cb\u4e3a\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u65f6\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u70b9\u5f97\u51fa\u3002\u5728\u6885\u6797\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f5c\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u4e3aMellin\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6574\u81ea\u65cb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5929\u4f53\u632f\u5e45\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u5e26\u6709\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6574\u81ea\u65cb", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5929\u4f53\u6885\u6797\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u70b9\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6574\u81ea\u65cb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb1\u548c2\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u6885\u6797\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6574\u81ea\u65cb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684OPE\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5929\u4f53\u632f\u5e45\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6574\u81ea\u65cb\u3002"}}

To accelerate training, limited by the low refresh rate of SLMs, spatial multiplexing of the input data across different spatial channels is possible maximizing the number of available spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). Precise alignment is required in order to ensure that the same physical operation is performed across each channel. We present a semi-automatic procedure for this experimentally challenging alignment resulting in a pixel-level conjugation. It is scalable to any number of SLMs and may be useful in wavefront shaping setups where precise conjugation of SLMs is required, e.g. for the control of optical waves in phase and amplitude. The resulting setup functions as an optical DNN able to process hundreds of inputs simultaneously, thereby reducing training times and experimental noise through spatial averaging.

The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.", "AI": {"tldr": "massive quantum systems can be used as tabletop systems to study quantum gravity, but traditional methods face major decoherence problems.

In response to this challenge, proposals to test quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravity in table-top experiments have attracted significant attention as a potentially feasible approach far below the Planck energy scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping. As a result, we find an exponential growth of gravity-induced entanglement between the oscillators, which reflects the dynamical instability of parametric resonant systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For static, spherically symmetric configurations, the field equations yield analytic solutions generalizing the Janis-Newman-Winicour and Buchdahl metrics, including the Schwarzschild-de Sitter limit. In the weak-field regime, linearized perturbations around Minkowski space lead to Yukawa-type corrections to the gravitational potential, with an effective Newton constant $G_{\\rm eff}$ and post-Newtonian parameter $\u03b3$ that recover General Relativity for heavy or weakly coupled scalars.

Half a century ago, the appearance of a moving emission source was addressed by Terrell and Penrose, who independently found that the aberration effect induces a conformal transformation on the observer's celestial sphere. Consequently, a snapshot of a moving sphere should remain circular. In this study, we examine the Terrell-Penrose effect with our ray-tracing simulations for two contrasting cases: i) static emission sources in the view of a moving observer, ii) and moving emission sources in the view of a static observer. In flat spacetime, it was believed that the images of the emission sources in these two cases are equivalent due to the relativity of motion. Our simulation demonstrates that although both cases remain apparent shape of the sphere, the apparent distortions of the images are different, and case ii) violates conformality on the observer's celestial sphere.

The first transition type is closely related to spectral singularities (SSs), at which point the transmission and reflection coefficients are divergent simultaneously. The second is associated with the emergence of bound states. In particular, under specific parameter conditions, we construct an exact bound state solution.

The MOG parameter $\u03b1$ introduces deviations from the Kerr metric, providing a means to test modified gravity in the strong field regime. Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $\u03b1$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $\u03c7_{\\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\\angle\u03b2_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features.

Applying a quasi-local prescription for the pressure anisotropy, we derive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and integrate them numerically over a large parameter space in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\u03b1$ and the degree of anisotropy $\u03b2$. We provide mass-radius sequences, mass-compactness, energy density, and pressure profiles, and perform a full stability analysis based on the turning-point criterion, the radial adiabatic index $\u03b3_r$, and the radial and transverse sound speeds $v_r^2$ and $v_t^2$. Our results show that positive $\u03b1$ and positive anisotropy $(\u03b2> 0)$ systematically increase the maximum mass and radius, enabling then configurations that exceed $2\\,M_\\odot$ while still obeying causality and the modified Buchdahl bound in 4DEGB gravity.

In conclusion, anisotropic dark-energy stars in 4DEGB gravity provide viable, observationally testable ultra-compact alternatives to normal neutron stars and black holes, and also potentially open rich avenues for further multi-messenger searches for higher-curvature effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6052\u661f\u5728\u56db\u7ef4\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u6069 gravity\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7684Chaplygin\u6c14\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u4ea4\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u7684\u51c6\u5c40\u90e8\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u7684TOV\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6b63\u7684\u9ad8\u65af-Bonnet\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u8d1d\u57fa\u5e03\u675c\u5c14\u754c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8fc72 M_sun\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff08NICER, GW170817, GW190814, \u548c\u5927\u8d28\u91cf Psr \u6d4b\u91cf\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5947\u89c2\u661f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u641c\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387 gravity \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7269\u8d28\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u6781\u81f4\u7d27\u51d1\u661f\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 Quasi-local \u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fee\u6539\u7684Chaplygin\u6c14\u4f53\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u7ef4\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u6069 gravity\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u7684TOV\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u65af- Bonnet \u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570 \u03b1 \u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u53c2\u6570 \u03b2 \u7684\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u3002", "result": "1. \u6b63\u7684 \u03b1 \u548c \u03b2 \u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u534a\u5f84\u30022. \u6052\u661f\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7 2 M_sun \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u9075\u5b88\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u8d1d\u57fa\u5e03\u675c\u5c14\u754c\u30023. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982 NICER, GW170817, GW190814, \u548c Psr \u6d4b\u91cf\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5947\u89c2\u661f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f15\u5165\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u661f\u5728\u56db\u7ef4\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u6069 gravity\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u7d27\u5bc6\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269\uff0c\u5373\u6bd4\u666e\u901a\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u661f\u4f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

We find that for sufficiently large values of $|\u039b|$ these black holes are generically asymptotically (A)dS and form a three-parameter family of black holes, with free parameters being the horizon radius, $\u039b$, and Bach parameter $b$. For smaller values of $|\u039b|$, fine-tuning of the Bach parameter is necessary to recover asymptotically (A)dS behaviour, resulting in two distinct two-parameter families of spherically symmetric black holes with (A)dS asymptotics. One family is the (A)dS-Schwarzschild solution, the other is a fine-tuned asymtotically (A)dS-Schwarzschild-Bach solution.

In most cases, the spontaneously-broken symmetry is parity. However, it is possible to obtain similar phases in systems without parity symmetry, through an antiunitary symmetry that implies a two-fold symmetry either on momentum or coordinate in the system's classical limit. To illustrate this phenomenon, we use a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) with one- and two-photon drives that, despite the breaking of parity symmetry, may have doubly-degenerate levels. Different realizations of squeezed KPOs convey a great deal of attention, as effective Hamiltonians for driven superconducting circuits and the occurrence of degeneracy in such systems could be of practical interest in their application to obtain protected qubits in parity-breaking setups.

Our simulation results show that HPQRC attains much higher accuracy with lower computational time than both classical and quantum-only models. This model is robust when environments are noisy and scales well across large datasets, and therefore is suitable for application on diverse problems such as financial forecasting, industrial automation, and smart sensor networks. Our results substantiate that HPQRC performs significantly faster than traditional architectures and could be a viable and highly scalable platform for actual edge computing systems.

The TNM leverages hierarchical tensor contractions to encode non-Markovian temporal correlations and multiscale structures, enabling compact and interpretable representations of chaotic flows. Using the Lorenz and R\u00f6ssler systems as benchmarks, we show that the TNM accurately reconstructs short-term trajectories and faithfully captures the attractor geometry. The model enables robust short-term forecasting beyond several Lyapunov times, offering a meaningful horizon for data-driven prediction under chaos. Inhomogeneous parametrization of weight tensors improves convergence and robustness compared to homogeneous parametrization, while scaling with bond dimension reveals saturation beyond modest values, consistent with the low intrinsic dimensionality of the chaotic attractor. This work establishes tensor networks as a universal paradigm for data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems, offering physically motivated control of model expressivity and opening pathways toward applications in climate systems and hybrid quantum-classical simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff08TNM\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u548c\u7f57\u65af\u52d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u52a8\u8361\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u754c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff08TNM\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5f20\u91cf\u6536\u7f29\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u548c\u7f57\u65af\u52d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u77ed\u671f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6355\u6349\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTNM\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8alesband\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u8d28\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6355\u6349\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6743\u91cd\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6cdb\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c14\u5019\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In nanophotonics, a promising platform for quantum technologies, entanglement generation via plasmon-mediated coupling in quantum dot qubits is often modeled within the dipole limit, where only dipolar plasmons of the mediating nanoparticle are considered, and the local response approximation, where nonlocal corrections are ignored. However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits. We find that multipolar modes and size-dependent damping lead to entanglement decay at small coupling distances and limit mediated entanglement with certain particle sizes.

Traditional mappings such as Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev often produce high-weight Pauli terms, increasing circuit depth and measurement complexity. Although several local qubit mappings have been proposed to address this challenge, most are specialized for structured models like the Hubbard Hamiltonian and perform poorly for realistic chemical systems with dense two-body interactions. In this work, we utilize a suite of techniques to construct compact and noise-resilient Fermion-to-qubit mappings suitable for general molecular Hamiltonians. Building on the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) and other similar works, we demonstrate that it outperforms prior encodings in both accuracy and hardware efficiency for molecular simulations. Our improvements include path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, introduction of multi-edge graph structures for enhanced error detection without added circuit depth, and a stabilizer measurement framework that directly maps logical terms and stabilizers to the Z-basis using Clifford simulation. Applying these methods to simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems yields significantly improved absolute and correlation energy estimates under realistic hardware noise, with further accuracy gains achieved by increasing code distance. We also propose a [[2N, N, 2]] variant of GSE compatible with square-lattice and (quasi-)linear hardware topologies, demonstrating a twofold reduction in RMSE for orbital rotations on IBM Kingston hardware.

However, due to the intrinsic complexity of quantum many-body systems, identifying a multipartite entanglement measure that is both efficiently computable and capable of accurately characterizing entanglement remains a challenging problem. To address these issues, we propose a family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures for mixed states, termed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements. Many well-known multipartite entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of this family of measures, such as the entanglement of formation and the concentratable entanglements introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 140501 (2021)]. We demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements constitutes a well-defined entanglement monotones, and establish several desirable properties it satisfies, such as subadditivity and continuity. We further investigate the ordering relations of unified-entropy concentratable entanglements and discuss how these quantities can be efficiently estimated on near-term quantum devices. As an application, we demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements can effectively distinguish between multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states. The ordering relations of these entanglement measures are further validated using four-partite star quantum network states and four-qubit Dicke states. Moreover, we find that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements exhibit greater sensitivity than the original concentratable entanglements in detecting certain four-partite star quantum network states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In practice, noise often drifts over time, whereas conventional noise characterization and decoding methods typically assume stationarity or provide only a time-average behavior of the noise. This treatment can result in suboptimal decoding performance. In this work, we present a rigorous analytical framework to capture time-dependent Pauli noise, by exploiting the syndrome statistics of quantum error correction experiments. We propose a sliding-window estimation method which allows us to recover the frequency components of the noise, by using optimal window sizes that we derive analytically. We prove the noise-filtering behavior of sliding windows, linking window size to spectral cutoff frequencies, and provide an iterative algorithm that captures multiple drift frequencies. We further introduce an overlapping window algorithm that enables us to capture rapid multi-frequency noise drifts in a single-pass fashion. Simulations for both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models validate our framework, demonstrating robust tracking of multi-frequency drift. The logical error rate obtained from our estimated models consistently align with the ground-truth logical error rate, and we find suppression of logical errors compared to static error models.

In this setting, quantum gates are realized by sequences of elementary braids of quasiparticles with exotic fractional statistics in certain two-dimensional topological condensed matter systems, described by effective topological quantum field theories. We specifically focus on a non-semisimple version of topological field theory, which provides a foundation for an extended theory of Ising anyons and which has recently been shown by Iulianelli et al., Nature Communications {\\bf 16}, 6408 (2025), to permit universal quantum computation. While the proofs of this pioneering result are existential in nature, the mixed integer programming provides an approach to explicitly construct quantum gates in topological systems. We demonstrate this by focusing specifically on the entangling controlled-NOT operation, and its local equivalence class, using braiding operations in the non-semisimple Ising system. This illustrates the utility of the Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming for topological quantum compilation.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a new framework for quantum compiling using mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming, applied to topological quantum computing with Ising anyons.", "motivation": "The work is driven by the search for fault-tolerant quantum computing methods, leveraging topological systems for robust qubit operations and universal quantum computation.", "method": "The method involves formulating the quantum compiling problem as a mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem to design braiding sequences for quantum gates in topological systems, specifically using Ising anyons.", "result": "The framework successfully models the task of compiling quantum gates in topological systems, and an explicit example of constructing a controlled-NOT gate is provided, demonstrating the approach's applicability.", "conclusion": "This work advances quantum computing by providing a practical methodology for synthesizing quantum gates using topological systems, potentially leading to scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing implementations."}}

The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a \"Forrelation\" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.\n  Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a \"use once\" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel \"second quantization\" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
