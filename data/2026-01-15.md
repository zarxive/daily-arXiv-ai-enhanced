### [1] [The geometry of CP violation in Kaluza-Klein models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08902)
*Joao Baptista*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究了更高维流形上的自由、无质量狄拉克方程，提出了新的几何路径来构建具有内蕴CP违反的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从更高的维度出发，探索CP违反的机制，具有理论和应用价值。

Method: 使用了旋量几何和黎曼横截理论，发展了详细的几何描述。

Result: 在四维中自然违反了CP对称性，提供构建具有内蕴CP违反模型的新途径。

Conclusion: 更高维流形上的狄拉克方程导出的CP违反机制丰富了理论物理学的理解。

Abstract: We investigate the free, massless Dirac equation $Dψ= 0$ on a higher-dimensional manifold $M_4 \times K$ equipped with a submersion metric. These background metrics generalize the Kaluza ansatz. They encode 4D massive gauge fields and Higgs-like scalars, alongside the usual 4D metric and massless gauge fields. We show that the dimensional reduction of the Dirac equation on these backgrounds naturally violates CP symmetry in four dimensions. This provides a new geometric path to constructing models with intrinsic CP violation. In this framework, massive gauge fields can break CP for three different reasons: $i)$ a misalignment between the mass eigenspinors and the spinors in the representation basis; $ii)$ a new non-minimal term coupling 4D fermions to massive gauge fields; $iii)$ the presence of a non-abelian Pauli term. All this derives from the higher-dimensional Dirac equation. Technically, the paper uses the language of spin geometry and Riemannian submersions. Along the way, it develops detailed geometric descriptions of several constructions. It discusses gauge anomalies, fermion generations, and introduces a new Lie derivative of spinors along non-Killing vector fields induced by actions of compact groups.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the time evolution of a $3+1$ dimensional spacetime, where space is a large three-sphere, due to small perturbations of the background fields. We focus on two classes of deformations. One corresponds on the worldsheet to time-dependent non-abelian Thirring deformations. The other to perturbations of the radius of the three-sphere. In the former case, we find that small deformations generically lead to big-bang and big-crunch singularities, near which the spacetime becomes highly anisotropic. We argue that string theory likely resolves these singularities. In the latter case, general solutions have the property that the radius of the three-sphere goes to infinity at a finite time, but there are no solutions in which it collapses to zero. We also discuss the interplay of these spacetime properties with the corresponding worldsheet RG flows.

Main category: hep-th

Conclusion: 结果为理解强动态无序系统的性质提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We consider a quantum mechanical model involving interacting fermions without disorder that has the same low energy physics as the supersymmetric SYK model. The model is $SU(2)$ invariant, and the supercharge involves the $ SU(2) $ 3j symbol. We analyze various solvable corners, conceptually explain why it has a melonic expansion, and perform an exact diagonalization for small values of $N$. Expanded around the states with maximal angular momentum, the model is approximated by a two dimensional CFT. The BPS states have a simple description in that regime.

### [4] [The CFT Distance Conjecture and Tensionless String Limits in $\mathcal N=2$ Quiver Gauge Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08909)
*José Calderón-Infante,Amineh Mohseni*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 这是关于$\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU$准共形场理论在无穷远距离极限的行为及其 bulk 对应的弦论的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究准共形场理论及其 bulk 对应的弦论在无穷远距离极限的行为具有重要意义。

Method: 主要通过计算大$N$的霍德兰温度$T_H$，并利用超对称性和距离猜想来分析。

Result: 霍德兰温度$T_H$在不同极限下表现出特定的行为，特别是对于线型准晶图，它仅依赖于准晶图的长度。在 holographic准晶图中，$T_H$与$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM相符，支持 Type IIB 弦论的 bulk 描述。此外，还找到了指数率α的下限，并通过弱耦合极限扩展了分析范围。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示，无穷远距离极限下的准共形场理论表现出特定的霍德兰温度和指数率，这些结果为理解其 bulk 对应的弦论提供了重要信息。

Abstract: We initiate the study of infinite-distance limits on (complex) multi-dimensional conformal manifolds of 4d SCFTs and their bulk interpretation as tensionless-string limits in AdS/CFT. In particular, we focus on 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU$ quiver gauge theories with hypermultiplets in the bifundamental and fundamental representations. In the overall-free limit, we compute the large-$N$ Hagedorn temperature $T_H$, which governs the stringy exponential growth of the density of states at high energies. We argue that this quantity determines the type of stringy ultraviolet completion in the bulk: it captures the type of string theory in which the bulk physics is embedded while remaining insensitive to detailed geometric data. For linear quivers, we find that $T_H$ depends only on the quiver length, which is tied to the number of NS5-branes in the underlying brane construction and, in turn, to the string theory in which the bulk is embedded. For holographic quivers, where we impose that the two central charges $a$ and $c$ coincide in the large-$N$ limit, we show that $T_H$ coincides with that of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, which befits the 10d Type IIB description of their gravitational duals. We also analyze the exponential rate $α$, which controls how the leading tower of higher-spin currents becomes conserved in these limits, as suggested by the CFT Distance Conjecture. In the large-$N$ regime, we derive sharp bounds on the minimal rate, $1/\sqrt{2}\le α_{\min}\le \sqrt{2/3}$, attained in the overall-free limit. Moreover, we prove that the universal lower bound $α\ge 1/\sqrt{2}$ holds, including at finite $N$. Finally, we go beyond the overall-free ray by characterizing the convex hull of the $\vecα$-vectors that encode the exponential rate of the higher-spin towers along any (partial) weak-coupling limit.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究宇宙学和量子场论中的不连续性关系有助于深入理解量子引力和宇宙学的基本原理。通过将平空间的单位arity切口提升为dS/EAdS观测量的不连续性关系，为研究dS/EAdS对偶提供了新的视角。或许能为量子引力的非perturbative研究带来启示。

Method: 论文使用了宇宙学装点规则和场论的单位arity切口方法，结合了微扰和非微扰方法。通过这种混合方法分析了保形耦合标量在树状水平和一环水平的不连续性关系。

Result: 该论文得出了tree-level和one-loop保形耦合标量过程中不连续性关系的一致性和相容性，展示了宇宙学装点规则在dS/EAdS关联中的重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究的结果表明，宇宙学装点规则是理解dS/EAdS介质中不连续性关系的关键工具，可能在未来研究量子引力和宇宙学中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Using cosmological dressing rules, we uplift flat-space unitarity cuts to discontinuity relations for dS/EAdS observables. In this representation, Cutkosky delta functions map directly to "Disc" operations in the exchanged energy variable. This provides a transparent diagram by diagram origin of cosmological cutting rules. We illustrate this with explicit examples at tree level and one loop for conformally coupled scalars.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决弦论中出现的发散性问题提供了一种有效方法，在后续研究中可进一步应用以探索更多物理现象。

Abstract: We explain and illustrate how to compute string-loop amplitudes in Calabi-Yau orientifold compactification in the large volume limit with the help of the patch-by-patch description of string field theory. We compute the one-loop partition function of the D1-instanton in type IIB string theory compactified on an O9 orientifold of a Calabi-Yau threefold to the first order in the large volume expansion. We show that the unphysical divergence arising from a naive choice of PCOs is canceled by vertical integration. The corollaries of this result, including the universal part of the normalization of the D-instanton superpotential and the one-loop renormalization of Kähler moduli, will be presented elsewhere.

Abstract: It is known that a two-dimensional bosonic theory with a non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry can be fermionized. Recent work shows that if the bosonic theory also has non-anomalous time-reversal symmetry, fermionization extends to non-orientable surfaces and yields a fermionic theory that depends on a $\mathrm{Pin}^-$ structure. Besides fermionization, one can define various topological manipulations, such as gauging and stacking invertible phases, which together generate a web of dualities. We prove that their group structure is the dihedral group $D_8$ of order 16. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the web from two perspectives: Symmetry TFT and actions on sectors of the $S^1$ Hilbert space.

### [8] [Bogomol'nyi Equations in Two-Species Born--Infeld Theories Governing Vortices and Antivortices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09091)

TL;DR: Derives new Bogomol'nyi equations in two-species U(1)×U(1) gauge theories using Born-Infeld electrodynamics, identifies solutions saturating energy bounds, and studies thermodynamics of multivortex configurations in both infinite and compact domains, finding modified behaviors due to symmetry.

Conclusion: 提供了解析多分量Born-Infeld规范理论中非线性多点磁化行为的新框架，研究精确的热力学性质，且在不同拓扑结构中观察到新的物理现象

Abstract: We derive several new Bogomol'nyi (self-dual) equations in two-species $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories governed by the Born--Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. By identifying appropriate Born--Infeld type Higgs potentials, we show that the highly nonlinear energy functionals admit exact topological lower bounds saturated by coupled first-order equations. The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings.
  Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges. These results provide a rare analytically solvable framework for studying thermodynamics in nonlinear multi-component gauge theories regulated by the Born--Infeld electrodynamics.

### [9] [Ghost-Free Stable Minkowski Vacua in Lovelock Compactifications on Irreducible Symmetric Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09256)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the compactification of higher-dimensional Lovelock gravity on compact irreducible symmetric spaces, focusing on conditions under which a physically healthy four-dimensional Minkowski vacuum exists. We show that when the internal dimension is five or less, or when the theory is restricted to the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet sector, the four-dimensional graviton (tensor sector) is necessarily a ghost. Inclusion of the cubic Lovelock term removes this ghost instability; however, the resulting Minkowski vacuum is generically only metastable, being accompanied by energetically favored Anti-de Sitter vacua. While such metastability cannot be avoided for spherical internal spaces, we identify an infinite class of higher-rank symmetric spaces where the true vacuum can be pushed to infinity in moduli space, thereby realizing genuinely stable and ghost-free Minkowski vacua at the level of the four-dimensional effective theory. To support these conclusions, we explicitly compute Lovelock terms up to cubic order on these spaces, confirming a universal log-convexity among the linear, quadratic, and cubic invariants, which plays a central role in our analysis.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the complex time evolution of a vacuum state with the insertion of a local primary operator in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs). This complex time evolution can be considered as a composite process constructed from Lorentzian time evolution and a Euclidean evolution induced by a post-selected measurement. Our main finding is that in the spatially-compact system, this complex time evolution drives the state of the subsystems to those of the primary state with the same conformal dimensions of the inserted operator. Contrary to the compact system, the subsystems of the spatially non-compact system evolve to states that depend on the non-unitary process during a certain time regime. In holographic systems with a compact spatial direction, this process induced by a heavy local operator can correspond to the relaxation from a black hole with an inhomogeneous horizon to that with a uniform one, while in the ones with a non-compact spatial direction, it can correspond to the relaxation to that with a horizon depending on the non-unitary process.

### [11] [Geodesics, One Point Functions and Black Hole Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09397)
*Parijat Dey,Arundhati Goldar,Nirmalya Kajuri*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Holographic black holes relate thermal boundary one-point functions to bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length. A perturbative radial deformation of Euclidean BTZ black holes shows that this relation remains robust. The results are established using WKB and saddle-point methods, and the validity of the WKB approximation is justified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper likely delves into the intricate relationship between boundary operators and bulk geometry in holographic models. The robustness of the geodesic relation under perturbations suggests a deeper geometric understanding. The use of WKB and saddle-point methods indicates a focus onperturbative quantum effects in gravity.

Method: The authors employ radial deformations of a Euclidean BTZ black hole, a tractable model in AdS/CFT. First-order perturbation theory is used to analyze the deformation. WKB and saddle-point methods are employed to calculate the one-point functions and geodesic lengths, respectively.

Result: The study finds that the boundary one-point functions are still governed by exponential dependence on modified geodesic lengths even after perturbations. The WKB approximation holds true, validated by exact computations.

Conclusion: This research strengthens the understanding that geodesic lengths are fundamental in determining one-point functions in holographic black holes. The conclusions underscore the resilience of such relations to perturbations, paving the way for further explorations in holographic duality.

Abstract: Holographic black holes exhibit a striking relation between thermal boundary one-point functions and bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal-dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length from its boundary insertion point to the horizon. We test the robustness of this relation under perturbations by considering an arbitrary radial deformation of an Euclidean BTZ black hole and working to first order in the perturbation. We find that the relation remains robust: the corrected one-point function at large conformal dimension is still governed by an exponent proportional to the modified boundary-to-horizon geodesic length. The result is established using WKB and saddle-point methods, with the validity of the WKB approximation justified by exact analyses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子计算中的复杂性理论是个重要课题，传统上nesbit的线路复杂性展示了线路构建的最小数目，但在允许非反演门后，扩展性可能被极大地影响。这种工作不仅扩展了量子电路模型，还提供了不同超选区之间的转换机制，这对理解量子计算能力的边界是极好的。

Method: 该论文运用了模块化张 Args类别理论，穿刺操作符融合运算，结合共轭数据，设计了适用于这种增加更灵活线路的量子操作框架。差异化方法在于将非反演门引入线路，这些门由融合运算符实现，这些运算符在统一前子结构下工作，从而保持无相位和合并的一致性。这种新的线路框架使用离散最短路径问题作为优化目标，而不再是传统的测地球道问题。

Result: 成功建立了一种新的量子计算复杂性模型，允许改变超选区或二维CFT中的conform families。这为量子计算中设计更有效的线路，利用更多的操作潜力提供了新视角。这一个新路径可能帮助减少线路数量，提高计算效率的计算模型，这对量子计算的发展和理论研究都是一种重要的理解升华。

Conclusion: 这项研究向量子计算的复杂性理论领域引入了新的模型和工具，扩展了现有线路复杂性的理解，特别是在处理更复杂和更灵活的操作时。这为未来的研究提供了一个新的框架，用于探索更高效的量子计算线路设计方法，尤其是在涉及更多种类操作的系统中。

Abstract: We extend Nielsen's formulation of quantum circuit complexity to include intrinsically non-invertible operations. Such gates arise from fusion with topological defect operators and remove a basic limitation of symmetry-based circuits: the inability to change superselection sectors, or in two-dimensional CFTs, conformal families. We realise fusion operations as completely positive, trace-preserving quantum channels acting between sectors, with consistency ensured by the fusion and associator data of an underlying unitary modular tensor category. In contrast to standard Nielsen circuits, non-invertible circuits lead to an optimisation problem that is no longer governed by geodesics on a continuous group manifold but instead reduces to a discrete shortest-path problem on the fusion graph of superselection sectors. We illustrate the framework in representative rational conformal field theories. Finally, we interpret fusion-induced transitions as discrete changes in boundary stress-tensor data, corresponding to shock-like defects in AdS$_3$ gravity.

Conclusion: 这项工作为量子电路复杂性提供了新的视角，特别是在涉及行列变的场景中，未来可能进一步扩展应用范围。

Abstract: Modern understanding of symmetry in quantum field theory includes both invertible and non-invertible operations. Motivated by this, we extend Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity to incorporate non-invertible gates. These arise naturally from fusion of topological defects and allow transitions between superselection sectors. We realise fusion operations as completely positive, trace-preserving quantum channels. Including such gates makes the sector-changing optimisation problem discrete: it reduces to a weighted shortest-path problem on the fusion graph. Circuit complexity therefore combines continuous geometry within sectors with discrete sector jumps. We illustrate the framework in rational conformal field theories and briefly comment on an AdS$_3$ interpretation in which fusion-induced transitions correspond to geometry-changing boundary operations. A companion paper provides full derivations and extended examples.

Abstract: We investigate the effective potential and the string tension for the spatial Wilson loop (SWL) in hot dense QGP with two types of anisotropy, i.e. external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy, employing a holographic approach for the heavy quark model. In this approach, the string is extended in the 5th, holographic direction and has a turning point either on a dynamical wall (DW) configuration or on the horizon configuration in the 5th direction. We obtain the magnetic catalysis behavior for a phase transition between DW and horizon configuration of the string. The structure of the phase diagram does not depend on the boundary conditions choice for the dilaton field. Inclusion of the external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy enhance the string tension in the horizon configuration, namely drag force. For the spatially isotropic case $ν= 1$ at different magnetic field values the string tension is proportional to $T^2$ and is qualitatively consistent with lattice results. However, for the anisotropic case, $ν= 4.5$, it deviates from the quadratic term.

TL;DR: 研究讨论了量子场论中因果体和量子系统的关系，探讨了不同量子流体代数的熵密度及其在 AdS/CFT 框架下的有效性。发现 AdS 中的因果体通常具有 III₁ 型代数，而有限大小的代数 III∞ 是可能的。研究结果表明，只有在重正化组极限下，才能得到 bulk 活动的代数，但这并不解决 AdS 尺度下的小距离问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们试图通过探讨量子场论和引力理论中的概念，理解AdS空间中的因果体和量子系统之间的关系，尤其是在不同代数类型（III₁ vs III∞）下的熵密度行为。

Method: 分析了几何量子化代数结构，探讨了AdS空间中的因果体附近代数的性质变化，尤其是在AdS与边界CFT之间的关系，进行了数学分析和理论推导。

Result: 研究结果证实了 III₁ 代数是AdS空间中大部分因果体的特征，III∞ 代数仅当因果体有足够大小时才出现。 bulk 活动的代数只能在特定极限下实现，但该极限无法解决AdS中的小距离问题。

Conclusion: 这些发现对理解AdS/CFT猜想和量子引力理论中的结构有重要意义，尤其是在考虑不同代数对熵密度和 bulk 解释的影响。

Abstract: Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson, Fischler and Susskind, and particularly Bousso suggested that, in the quantum theory of gravity, this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made by Fischler and one of the present authors. Leutheusser and Liu showed that, in the $N = \infty$ limit, causal diamonds with finite area in AdS radius units had Type $III_1$ von Neumann sub-algebras of the full operator algebra. They claimed that this was true for finite values of the UV cutoff, and that the algebra was the algebra of bulk local fields in the diamond. We will argue that the second part of this conjecture is incorrect and that the bulk field algebra emerges only in a double scaled limit, where the boundary UV cutoff is taken to infinity as $N$ is taken to infinity. There is never a bulk field theory description that resolves distances smaller than the AdS radius.

Abstract: Recent work revealed a tension between the Gross-Mende analysis of the high-energy fixed-angle behavior of string amplitudes and the explicit numerical data. Motivated by this puzzle, we revisit the problem of classifying saddle-point geometries for the one-loop amplitude. We find an infinite family of complex saddles that dominate the high-energy regime. Using general constraints and matching to numerical data, we formulate a bootstrap problem that determines their multiplicities. This procedure yields a precise asymptotic expansion of the one-loop amplitude at high energies. The resulting oscillatory contributions lead to a much richer high-energy behavior than that predicted by the original Gross-Mende analysis.

Abstract: The discovery of new magnetic ground states in geometrically frustrated lattices remains a central challenge in materials science. Here, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and frustrated magnetic properties of FeGe$_3$O$_4$, a newly identified compound that crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric cubic space group $P2_13$. In this structure, Fe atoms form an intricate double-trillium lattice with nearest-neighbor Fe--Fe distances of $\sim$4.2~Å, while Ge$^{2+}$ ions mediate magnetic interactions through Fe-Ge-Fe pathways. Field-dependent magnetization at 2~K shows a pronounced nonlinearity, reaching a maximum moment of 2.55(3)~$μ_\mathrm{B}$/Fe$^{2+}$ at 70~kOe without evidence of saturation. Magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering collectively reveal the onset of short-range magnetic interactions near 5~K, with no long-range ordering detected down to 0.06~K. Specific heat measurements demonstrate strong frustration: only $\sim$34\% of the expected magnetic entropy is recovered at 2.4~K. Taken together, these results establish FeGe$_3$O$_4$ as a rare example of a geometrically frustrated trillium-lattice magnet, offering a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum magnetic phenomena.

Abstract: We probe the density-wave transition of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with polarization-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The low-energy electrodynamics is strongly anisotropic, with metallic in-plane and insulating out-of-plane character. In the ordered phase, the anisotropy grows more than an order of magnitude as the out-of-plane conductivity is sharply suppressed. We interpret this enhancement as an effective electronic decoupling of the Ni-O layers, driven by a spin-density-wave-induced redistribution of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ occupation within the trilayers. This electronic response is accompanied by clear shifts and splittings of the out-of-plane phonons, compatible with a density-wave instability of electronic origin.

Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to explore the exotic electronic and magnetic phenomena in V-based Kagome metals, particularly their low-temperature magnetic behavior and the interplay of topology and magnetism.

Method: The study employs a combined thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation (μSR) investigation of single-crystal RV₆Sn₆ compounds, focusing on their low-temperature magnetic behavior.

Abstract: Understanding intertwined phases near quantum criticality is a central challenge in correlated electron systems. The kagome metal CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ provides a fertile platform to investigate the interplay between charge-density-wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Here, combining x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we uncover a dimensional evolution of the CDW upon Ti substitution. We find that even infinitesimal Ti doping (x = 0.009) completely suppresses the three-dimensional 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 4 CDW present in pristine CsV3Sb5, while reducing the remaining 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 CDW to a quasi-two-dimensional order. With further Ti substitution, although no CDW transition is discernible in resistivity measurements, our XRD and STM data reveal the emergence of a (quasi-)one-dimensional CDW with a short correlation length of $\sim$ 20 $Å$ at x = 0.2. The stripelike CDW undergoes a continuous second-order phase transition, characterized by a gradual increase in intensity and correlation length below $\sim$ 56 K. Our results elucidate the dimensional evolution of CDW order in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ and provide new insight into understanding the unconventional CDWs and their role in kagome superconductors.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解1D系统中非对称多重-Q磁性结构提供了一个理论框架，这有助于解释最近的实验观测结果。

Abstract: We theoretically investigate multiple-$Q$ magnetic states emerging from the interference between finite-$Q$ spiral and staggered spin modulations in a one-dimensional itinerant electron system. The multiple-$Q$ spin textures are characterized by a superposition of symmetry-unrelated ordering wave vectors in the same direction with distinct periodicities rather than rotationally symmetry-related ones. Motivated by recent experimental observations of broken helix magnetic structures in EuIn$_2$As$_2$, we focus on the microscopic interaction conditions in stabilizing such multiple-$Q$ states.We employ two effective spin models: One is the momentum-space-based model, and the other is the real-space-based model, both of which include bilinear and biquadratic easy-plane anisotropic interactions. By analyzing their ground state via simulated annealing, we find that a superposition of a spiral and a staggered modulation yields a robust double-$Q$ magnetic structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the obtained double-$Q$ spin configuration exhibits an antisymmetric spin-split band structure even without the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and further reveals asymmetric band modulations when the magnetic field is applied along the out-of-plane direction. Our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding unconventional multiple-$Q$ magnetic textures in one-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Studying finite-temperature properties with tensor networks is notoriously difficult, especially at low temperatures, due to the rapid growth of entanglement and the complexity of thermal states. Existing methods like purification and minimally entangled typical thermal states offer partial solutions but struggle with scalability and accuracy in low-temperature regime. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach based on generating-function matrix product states (GFMPS). By directly computing a large set of Bloch-type excited states, we construct Gibbs states that moderate the area-law constraint, enabling accurate and efficient approximation of low-temperature thermal behavior. Our benchmark results show magnificent agreement with both exact diagonalization and experimental observations, validating the accuracy of our approach. This method offers a promising new direction for overcoming the longstanding challenges of studying low-temperature properties within the tensor network framework. We also expect that our method will facilitate the numerical simulation of quantum materials in comparison with experimental observations.

TL;DR: Bad metals exhibit altered thermal conductivity from the expected Fermi-liquid behavior, possibly due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, as revealed by linking the temperature dependence of resistivity to magnetic ordering through NMR and mean-field theory analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind non-Fermi-liquid behavior in bad metals, particularly the role of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, is crucial for advancing our knowledge of unconventional electronic states and metal-insulator transitions.

Method: The study combines experimental techniques like NMR and transport measurements with theoretical modeling using dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the crossover from quasiparticle-dominated to magnetic-ordered regimes at higher temperatures.

Result: The experimental findings, including deviations from the Korringa law and temperature-dependent resistivity, are successfully captured by dynamical mean-field theory. The analysis highlights that the positive slope in resistivity ($dho/dT > 0$) near the Mott insulator is primarily due to temperature-dependent electronic compressibility rather than diffusion.

Conclusion: This work provides a detailed understanding of the transition from Fermi-liquid to bad-metal behavior in $
u$-based compounds, emphasizing the importance of electronic compressibility in determining the temperature dependence of resistivity.

Abstract: Non-Fermi-liquid charge transport in the vicinity of electronic instabilities has been intensely studied for decades. Deviations from $ρ_{\rm FL}=ρ_0+AT^2$ in bad and strange metals are commonly ascribed to a breakdown of Landau's quasiparticle (QP) concept. Yet, it remains unclear what mechanism drives the temperature dependence of $ρ(T)$ beyond $ρ_{\rm FL}$. Here, we examine the bad metal upon approaching the Mott metal-insulator transition via chemical pressure in $κ$-[(BEDT-STF)$_x$(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$]$\rm _2 Cu_2 (CN)_3$. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transport experiments on the same single crystals, we directly link the onset of deviations from Korringa law $(T_1T)^{-1} = \mathrm{const.}$ with the rise of $ρ(T)$ beyond $ρ_{\rm FL}$. From the NMR relaxation rate, we can identify the gradual crossover between the QP-dominated regime at low $T$ to predominant local moments at higher $T$. By comparing our experimental findings with dynamical mean-field theory calculations, which accurately reproduce the transport data, we reveal how this crossover is reflected in $T$-dependent changes of the QP spectrum. Near the Mott insulator, where $dρ/dT<0$ at high $T$, an Einstein-relation analysis shows that bad-metal behavior with $dρ/dT>0$ is driven by the temperature dependence of the electronic compressibility rather than the diffusion constant.

Motivation: 研究者希望以更精确的方法处理 helical Luttinger 液体的哈密顿量，特别是如何处理复杂的两粒子散射过程，并验证理论预测的gap行为。

Method: 该研究采用了一维格点上的切线自旋方法，直接离散哈密顿量，避免了sine色散的fermion加倍障碍，保留了时间反转会对称性。

Result: 数值模拟（基于张量网络计算）在有限格点上证实了无限系统中的分析结果，当铁磁能级调至Dirac点且Luttinger参数超过临界值时，出现了一个gap开的相，时间反转会在此时被部分破坏。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持理论预测：通过调整费米能级至Dirac点并超过特定Luttinger参数值，可以诱导一个gap开且时间反转会松的相。

Abstract: We extend a recently developed "tangent fermion" method to discretize the Hamiltonian of a helical Luttinger liquid on a one-dimensional lattice, including two-particle backscattering processes that may open a gap in the spectrum. The fermion-doubling obstruction of the sine dispersion is avoided by working with a tangent dispersion, preserving the time-reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The numerical results from a tensor network calculation on a finite lattice confirm the expectation from infinite-system analytics, that a gapped phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry emerges when the Fermi level is tuned to the Dirac point and the Luttinger parameter crosses a critical value.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一種新视角來理解和 syrup Jahn-Teller变形的相變一只手is across materials. 其主要發現是： crystal structure play a crucial role in determining whether JT distortions exhibit order-disorder or displacement-like behavior during phase transitions. This has important implications for predicting and designing materials with specific electronic and structural properties.

Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $ρ$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.

Abstract: A sudden change in material properties creates a temporal interface and forces a propagating wave to change its frequency while preserving its wavenumber. In contrast to monoatomic lattices with a single frequency-wavenumber pair, polyatomic lattices support multiple frequencies for each wavenumber. To date, experimental observations are limited to topologically trivial monoatomic phononic systems. Here, we utilize analytical, numerical, and experimental methods to examine topologically non-trivial phononic lattices subject to temporal interfaces. In particular, we realize phononic lattices demonstrating single-frequency shift (i.e., mode conservation) and multi-frequency splitting (i.e., mode conversion) following a temporal interface. Accordingly, we generalize temporal analogues of Snell's law and Fresnel equations. Moreover, we utilize Bloch mode overlaps to obtain a phononic time lens and a classical analogue of dynamic quantum phase transitions for phonons. Such overlap determines the probability of mode conversion or conservation after a temporal interface and, more importantly, can carry hidden topological characteristics. Our methodology paves the way for the use of temporal interfaces in probing phonon band topology and the realization of advanced acoustic devices.

Conclusion: 结合电致变性和 flexoelectric 效应，广义转换方程为薄膜变形模型提供了更精确的理论依据。

Abstract: When a thin film is deposited on an incompatible elastic substrate, the film develops an elastic mismatch strain, causing the film-substrate system to bend. Stoney's equation relates the curvature of the bent film-substrate system with the residual stress developed in the film, and can be used to infer film properties from curvature measurements. Certain materials exhibit electromechanical coupling, such as piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity, which can alter the curvature and strains. In this work, we generalize Stoney's equation to include flexoelectric and piezoelectric effects in the film. Considering both open and closed circuit configurations, as well as uniform and non-uniform film properties, we compare different cases of electromechanical coupling and discuss their influence on curvature, strains, and electric polarization in the film.

Abstract: This article presents a novel fabrication route for miniaturized piezoelectric actuators that relies exclusively on processes based on femtosecond (fs) laser ablation. Previous work has already demonstrated that fs-lasers are uniquely suited for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators based on PMN-PT, which are required for multiaxial strain-tuning of quantum dots (QDs) to enable, e.g. the generation of highly entangled photon pairs. Building on these foundations, the present work advances actuator performance and capabilities by introducing a local thinning strategy. This approach allows the realization of smaller devices, which in turn enables lower operating voltages, while simultaneously offering the possibility of integrating multiple quantum light sources on a single chip. The article provides a detailed description of the full fabrication chain, entirely based on fs-laser processing steps, from substrate thinning to metal layer structuring and final device definition. A particular focus is placed on the final cutting process, where the implementation of a third-harmonic ultraviolet (UV) fs-laser wavelength significantly improves edge quality and shape definition compared to the second harmonic (SH) wavelength used in previous work. The device fabricated through the combination of local thinning and UV-based cutting promises not only to enhance the efficiency of strain transfer but also to ensure the mechanical stability required for practical applications. These results establish fs-laser-based fabrication as a versatile and scalable method for next-generation piezoelectric actuators, paving the way for advanced strain-engineering approaches in semiconductor quantum optics and integrated quantum photonics.

*Amol R. Holkundkar*

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that high-harmonic generation can effectively measure tunneling delay and supports attoclock techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the use of high-harmonic generation as a method to study tunneling delay in strong-field ionization.

Method: Full time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) simulations combined with classical three-step-model (TSM) trajectories were used to analyze the tunneling delay.

Result: The extracted tunneling delay scales as τ_d ∝ 1/√I0, consistent with theoretical models and observations for Hydrogen, Helium, and Argon atoms across a range of laser parameters.

Conclusion: High-harmonic generation provides a robust, complementary tool to study tunneling dynamics independently of established attoclock techniques.

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of using high-harmonic generation (HHG) as a complementary probe of tunneling delay in strong-field ionization. By combining time--frequency analysis of HHG spectra obtained from full time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) simulations with classical three-step-model (TSM) trajectories, we extract an effective tunneling delay associated with electron motion through the laser-suppressed Coulomb barrier. The analysis is carried out for Hydrogen, Helium, and Argon atoms over a range of laser wavelengths and peak intensities within the tunneling regime. The extracted delay exhibits a systematic dependence on the instantaneous field strength and barrier width at the ionization time, and follows the expected $τ_d \propto 1/\sqrt{I_0}$ scaling consistent with Keldysh--Rutherford-type models and attoclock observations. When recast in terms of the Keldysh parameter, the tunneling delay collapses onto a near-universal trend across different atomic species. While HHG does not provide a direct measurement of tunneling time, the present results demonstrate that it can serve as a robust, internally consistent diagnostic of tunneling dynamics, offering an independent and complementary perspective to established attoclock techniques.

Conclusion: 该研究为173Yb+离子的光栅结构研究提供了新的数据，并且在核物理和量子计算方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Compared to other stable isotopes of $\rm{Yb}^+$, $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ has a richer hyperfine structure, which leads to more favorable clock transitions, spectroscopic techniques for probing new physics, and more sophisticated quantum computing architectures. However, to date, its electronic spectrum remains poorly characterized. Here, we report on efficient laser cooling, state preparation, and detection of a single trapped $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ ion. The previously unobserved $^2\!S_{1/2} \rightarrow {}^2\!D_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition at 436 nm is coherently excited, and the isotope shift between $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+$ and $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ on this transition is determined with an uncertainty of 1.4 Hz. Using microwave spectroscopy, we resolve the hyperfine structure (HFS) of the ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ state with a relative uncertainty below $10^{-8}$. From the HFS measurement data, we infer for ${}^{173}$Yb a nuclear magnetic octupole moment $Ω= -0.062(8)\,({\rm b} \times μ_N)$ with uncertainty reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to previous studies. The data also allow us to determine hyperfine anomalies for the ${}^2\!S_{1/2}$ and ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ states.

### [32] [Constraining axion-like dark matter with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09638)
*A. Rigoulet,S. Nanos,I. K. Kominis,D. Antypas*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: This paper reports a successful radio-frequency operated ^{87}Rb atomic magnetometer search for axion-like-particle (ALP) interactions. The instrument is designed to detect oscillating pseudomagnetic fields generated by ALP-fermion coupling. Although no statistically significant signature was observed in the mass range of 2.40e-10 to 2.11e-9 eV/c², upper limits on ALP-proton, neutron, and electron couplings were established, improving or complementing previous bounds. The study extends ALP-fermion interaction searches into an unexplored mass region with potential implications for dark matter detection.

Motivation: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are promising candidates for addressing the dark matter mystery. Detecting ALP-fermion interactions could provide insights into their role as dark matter particles and open new avenues in particle physics.

Method: A broadband radio-frequency operated ^{87}Rb atomic magnetometer was utilized to search for oscillating pseudomagnetic fields caused by ALP interactions with atomic fermions. The device's wide spectral coverage and sensitivity were key in identifying potential ALP-induced signals.

Result: No statistically significant oscillating magnetic field signatures were detected. Upper limits were set for ALP couplings with protons, neutrons, and electrons, improving existing laboratory limits for protons and complementing astrophysical bounds for neutrons and electrons. The search specifically targets ALP-fermion interactions in previously unexplored mass ranges relevant to dark matter.

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding of ALP interactions and suggest that the developed method is effective for dark matter searches, particularly in exploring the mass regions of the Galactic dark matter halo.

Abstract: We report on a broadband search for axion-like-particle (ALP) interactions using a radio-frequency-operated $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic magnetometer. The instrument provides wide spectral coverage and sensitivity to an oscillating pseudomagnetic field that may be generated by the gradient coupling of the ALP field to the constituent fermions of atoms. We search for an ALP-gradient signature in the mass range $2.40\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$--$2.11\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$. No statistically significant signatures of an oscillating magnetic field are observed, and we derive upper limits on the corresponding ALP-proton, -neutron and -electron couplings, $g_{αpp}$, $g_{αnn}$ and $g_{αee}$, respectively. The result on $g_{αpp}$ improves over previous laboratory searches, while the limits on $g_{αnn}$ and $g_{αee}$ complement earlier laboratory searches and astrophysical bounds. The work extends searches for ALP-fermion interactions into a mass region largely unexplored in a dark-matter context, demonstrating the potential of our method for broadband axion-like particle searches targeting the Galactic dark-matter halo.

Abstract: We examine the influence of a static dc electric field on Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) resonances that involve highly excited Rydberg states. Our focus is on how these resonances are altered when the relative orientation between the laser polarization and the external electric field vectors are varied. We experimentally demonstrate characteristic variations in the amplitude of the Stark-split EIT resonances, which can be explained by the selection rules in various geometries. We also present a simplified semi-analytical model that closely resembles the experimental observations. We use these findings to obtain information about the spatially inhomogeneous electric field, produced by a biased wire, using EIT fluorescence measurements that agrees with the expected angular dependencies. These results suggest that simultaneous analysis of frequency shifts and amplitudes of Rydberg EIT resonances may enable vector electrometry of electrostatic fields, necessary for many quantum sensing applications.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of spin-wave scattering by a twisted domain wall (DW) in a two-dimensional ferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy. While the twisted DW generates an effective gauge field for spin waves, leading to a deflection of their trajectories, our main focus is on a distinct effect that arises when a hard-axis anisotropy is present in addition to the easy-axis anisotropy. In this case, the translational symmetry of the spin-wave Hamiltonian along the DW is broken, resulting in a periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian. This periodicity leads to the formation of multiple diffracted spin wave modes on both sides of the DW, engendering a DW-induced magnonic diffraction pattern. The interplay between the emergent gauge field and the anisotropy-induced periodicity reveals rich spin-wave dynamics and suggests potential applications for manipulating magnon flow in two-dimensional magnetic textures.

Abstract: The photoluminescence (PL) of momentum-indirect $\rm Γ- K$ excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ under biaxial strain was recently observed by Blundo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067402 (2022)], yet its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here we develop a unified framework that reproduces the measured PL and reveals its fundamental excitonic mechanism. We reveal that: (i) the PL originates from genuinely hybridized direct-indirect excitonic eigenstates, rather than nominally mixed species with fixed dominant character; (ii) the direct exciton converts into the indirect one via a previously unrecognized two-step pathway -- exchange-interaction-driven exciton transfer followed by a spin flip; and (iii) a higher-energy indirect exciton, absent from prior studies, acts as a crucial intermediate mediating this conversion. Beyond explaining experiment, our theory predicts a striking strain-driven "sinusoidal'' valley response, furnishing a continuously tunable valley dial that far exceeds binary control schemes. This unified picture of strain-engineered direct-indirect exciton dynamics introduces a new paradigm for manipulating long-lived valley degrees of freedom, opening a pathway toward programmable valley pseudospin engineering and next-generation valleytronic quantum technologies.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the generation of multiple three-magnon splitting processes in an in-plane magnetized submicron Bi-YIG disk using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering. The low magnetic damping and strong magneto-optical response of BiYIG enable the detection of nonlinear spin-wave interactions at low threshold powers. By tuning the in-plane static magnetic field, excitation frequency, and power, we observe the generation of three pairs of secondary modes symmetrically distributed around half the excitation frequency. Time-resolved BLS measurements present temporal dynamics and threshold behavior associated with the successive activation of three-magnon pairs.

Abstract: Dynamical perturbations can modify the energy landscape of a physical system, such that unstable equilibrium configurations become stable when subject to an external drive. The magnetic analog of such dynamical stabilization corresponds to saturation of the magnetization against an external field. Here we report dynamical stabilization of the magnetization in thin film bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet by spin current injection from an adjacent Pt layer. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements demonstrate magnetization reversal against magnetic fields up to 3000 times larger than the film's coercivity once the spin injection surpasses a critical threshold associated with negative damping. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this process is mediated by the excitation of a large population of incoherent magnons with non-zero wave vector, leading to a transient shortening and subsequent stabilization of the inverted magnetization. The elementary excitations of the high-energy inverted magnetization state are shown to be antimagnons, quasi-particles carrying opposite energy and spin relative to magnons. Our results further reveal how the system's size and minimization of nonlinear magnon scattering processes play a key role in dynamical stabilization, opening new avenues for magnetic state control beyond conventional magnetization switching. Dissipation-driven phase transitions in large-area magnetic systems provide a solid-state platform to study magnonic analogs of relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling and black holes, as well as spin-wave amplification and lasing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: One-dimensional semiconductors are characterized by strongly bound excitons. Therefore, the Frenkel regime of excitons localized within a few unit cells is readily reached and traditional Wannier exciton models become inadequate. In the presence of strong electric fields, excitons are polarized and, in extreme cases, ionized. Such strong-field effects have previously been described analytically for Wannier excitons. In the present work, we show that analytical results can be extended to the more involved Frenkel case as well. Hence, by analytically solving the difference equation describing Frenkel excitons in electric fields, we derive close-form expressions for resonances providing Stark shifts and ionization rates. Moreover, closed-form results for exciton electroabsorption spectra and dynamic polarizability are obtained.

Abstract: Heterostructures combining graphene with 3d transition metal ferromagnets (FMs) enable various spin-based phenomena at ultrafast timescales. However, challenges such as the interfacial impedance mismatch, FM deposition-induced defect generation, and interface modification by interfacial coupling or hybridization can impede their functionalization for spin-orbitronics. In this work, we utilize insulating TiOx barrier layers (BLs) to modify the interfacial spin conductance structurally, disentangle spin pumping and magnetic proximity effects (MPE), and establish external control over ultrafast magnetization dynamics in single-layer graphene/TiOx/Co systems. All-optical time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements of femtosecond to nanosecond spin dynamics reveal systematic tunability of ultrafast magnetic parameters via barrier engineering. The thickness-dependent damping modulation in Co indicates strong spin pumping, with interfacial spin transparency close to half its physical limit in the presence of an ultrathin BL, where MPE is eliminated. Our results show that appropriately chosen ultrathin BLs can prevent interfacial alterations from ferromagnetic metals, facilitating efficient spin detection in graphene and enhancing control over spin angular momentum dissipation in graphene/FM interfaces.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films under both dark and illuminated conditions. In the dark, the intrinsic magnetism of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is shown to yield a stronger anisotropic RKKY spin model compared to nonmagnetic topological insulators, providing a clear signature for differentiating these systems. Furthermore, key band properties -- such as energy gap, band degeneracy/splitting, and topological deformations of the Fermi surface -- imprint distinct signatures on the RKKY interaction, enabling clear discrimination between even- and odd-septuple-layer (SL) films. This discrimination manifests in multiple ways: through the Fermi-energy dependence or spatial oscillations of the interaction for impurities on the same surface, or via the presence versus absence of spin-frustrated terms for those on different surfaces. Under off-resonant circularly polarized light, we track photoinduced topological phase transitions and identify two characteristic signatures at the phase boundary: a sign reversal in spin-frustrated terms and a dip in collinear RKKY components. These serve as fingerprints for circular-polarization-chirality-dependent topological transitions in even- and odd-SL films, respectively. Overall, this work establishes RKKY interactions as a sensitive magnetic probe for revealing both distinctive band properties and light-driven phase transitions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, thereby complementing conventional electrical measurements while providing new insights into the influence of intrinsic magnetism on the surface-state band structure.

Abstract: The role of interface states and dielectric mismatch is studied in ultrathin P-doped silicon-on-insulator (SOI) films with thickness of the device layer ($H_{SOI}$) varying from 30 to 8 nm and dopant concentration ($n_{D}$) ranging from 10$^{18}$ to nearly 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($ρ$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($μ_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $μ_e$. These effects, which are steadily enhanced decreasing $n_D$, are attributed to non-passivated interface states at the SiO$_2$/Si interface and can be significantly mitigated by high temperature rapid thermal oxidation (RTO). The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties. After effective interface engineering, low temperature electrical characterization revealed a significant increase in P ionization energy in samples with $H_{SOI}$ <= 15 nm, a result directly related to the dielectric mismatch.

*Anuradha Jagannathan*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper connects two significant physics models—the one-dimensional quasicrystals and the two-dimensional Quantum Hall problem—through a common ancestor model called the Fibonacci-Hall model, thereby elucidating their underlying relationship and implications for their respective fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the connection between 1D quasicrystals and the 2D Quantum Hall problem is crucial for advancing our knowledge in condensed matter physics, especially regarding topological properties and their inheritance across different dimensional systems.

Method: The authors employ a geometric approach using the cut-and-project method to relate the external magnetic flux in the Quantum Hall problem to a geometric flux in the quasicrystal. They extend Chern numbers from 2D to 1D systems by maintaining adiabatic continuity, providing a theoretical bridge between the two models.

Result: Through the Fibonacci-Hall model, the paper successfully demonstrates that the Chern numbers of 2D bands under geometric flux can explain the gap labels in 1D systems, thereby establishing a deeper connection between their topological properties.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in linking quasiperiodic structures with the Quantum Hall effect opens new avenues for exploring topological invariants in lower-dimensional systems and their applications in material science.

Abstract: 1D quasicrystals such as the Fibonacci chain have been said to ``inherit" their topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall problem. Yet, a direct way to see the connection was lacking until a common ancestor, the Fibonacci-Hall model, was introduced recently \cite{aj2025}. This 2D ancestor model relates the role of the external magnetic flux in the Hall problem and that of a geometric flux which describes the winding of the quasicrystal in 2D, in the cut-and-project method. Doing this enables us to extend the notion of Chern numbers as defined in 2D, to the energy bands of the 1D chain by adiabatic continuity. The older notion of gap labels in the 1D system are now seen to be derivable from the Chern numbers of the 2D bands. The Fibonacci-Hall model thus provides an important link between physics of two paradigmatic models, the Fibonacci quasicrystal and the quantum Hall insulator. The generalization to other 1D quasiperiodic models is expected to be relatively straightforward. The extension to 2D cut-and-project tilings is left for future studies.

Abstract: A recent STM experiment in 2D bilayer graphene [Y.-C. Tsui, et al., Nature 628, 287 (2024)], under a strong perpendicular magnetic field, has made a direct observation of the existence of three distinct filling-factor-dependent quantum phases in the lowest Landau level: the incompressible fractional quantum Hall liquid, a crystalline compressible hexagonal Wigner crystal with long-range order and rotational symmetry-breaking, and a random localized solid phase with no spatial order. We argue that the spatially random localized phase at low filling is the recently proposed disorder-dominated strongly localized amorphous "Anderson solid" phase [A. Babber, et al., arXiv:2601.03521], which appears generically at a sample-dependent filling factor.

Abstract: Time-periodic modulation of a static system is a powerful method for realizing robust unidirectional topological states. So far, all such realizations have been based on interactions among $s$ orbitals, without incorporating inter-orbital couplings. Here, we demonstrate higher-orbital Floquet topological insulators by introducing periodically modulated couplings between the optical $s$ and $p$ orbitals in a square lattice. The staggered phase of the $s$-$p$ couplings gives rise to a synthetic uniform $π$ magnetic flux per plaquette of the lattice, and periodic driving of the couplings opens a topological bandgap, characterized by the Floquet winding number. We image topological edge modes of $s$-$p$ orbitals traveling unidirectionally around a corner. Here, the topological phases are realized by a combined effect of the periodic driving and synthetic magnetic flux. Consequently, when the synthetic flux is turned off, the system becomes trivial over a range of driving parameters. Our results open a promising pathway for exploring topological phenomena by introducing the orbital degree of freedom.

Abstract: Digital cameras and displays utilise picture elements (pixels) that perform a single function: detecting or emitting light intensity. To exploit the full information content of electromagnetic waves, more advanced elements are required. This has driven the development of multifunctional components, which for example, simultaneously detect and emit intensity or extract intensity and spectral information. However, no pixel exists that both senses and generates optical wavefronts with full control over amplitude, phase, and polarisation, limiting reciprocal control and feedback of sophisticated light fields. Here we present a route to such pixels by demonstrating a versatile platform of miniaturised diffractive elements based on Fourier optics. We exploit plasmonic surface waves, which propagate coherently and efficiently across metallic surfaces. When these plasmons are launched towards wavy microstructures designed with simple Fourier analysis, arbitrary and background-free optical wavefronts are generated. Conversely, incoming light can be sensed and its amplitude, phase, and polarisation fully characterised. By combining or superposing several such components, we create multifunctional 'Fourier pixels' that provide compact and accurate control over the optical field. Our approach, which could also use photonic waveguide modes, establishes a scalable, universal architecture for vectorially programmable pixels with applications in adaptive optics, holographic displays, optical communication, and quantum-information processing.

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of temperature, axial strain, and refractive index is critical for structural health monitoring, industrial process control, and environmental sensing. However, conventional optical fiber sensors are often limited by strong parameter cross sensitivity, poor discrimination capability, and increased system complexity when multiple sensing units are required. In this work, a compact multi-parameter optical fiber sensing platform is proposed based on a cascaded single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, and long-period fiber grating structure, combined with a wavelength-based spectral demodulation strategy. Within the cascaded configuration, multiple characteristic spectral troughs arising from distinct physical mechanisms coexist in a single transmission spectrum. Interference-induced troughs are generated by the multimode fiber section, while a resonance-induced trough is introduced by the long-period fiber grating. Although none of these troughs responds exclusively to a single parameter, each exhibits simultaneous and linearly independent responses to temperature, axial strain, and refractive index with distinct sensitivity magnitudes and trends. Consequently, each trough can be described by a unique sensitivity vector, enabling robust multi-parameter discrimination through multi-wavelength spectral demodulation.

Abstract: Recently, higher-order topological phases have been extended from Euclidean lattices to non-Euclidean hyperbolic lattices. Though higher-order topological type-I hyperbolic lattices have been extensively studied, their counterpart, higher-order topological type-II hyperbolic lattices, have never been reported yet. Here, by mapping the celebrated Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model onto a type-II hyperbolic lattice, we present a theoretical exploration of the first-order topological edge states and second-order topological corner states in a type-II hyperbolic lattice. Compared with the higher-order topological type-I hyperbolic lattices, we discover two unique topological phenomena that stem from the nontrivial geometrical topology of the type-II hyperbolic lattice. First, topological edge and corner states exist on both inner and outer boundaries of the type-II hyperbolic lattice and exhibit higher degeneracy than those in the type-I hyperbolic lattice with only an outer boundary. Second, the degeneracy of type-II hyperbolic corner states can be arbitrarily tuned by changing the characteristic (or inner) radius, in contrast to its type-I counterpart, which is determined by the number of sides of the tessellated polygons. Our work explores topological states in more complex hyperbolic lattices, significantly expanding the research scope of hyperbolic topological physics.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in hyperbolic lattices have expanded the study of topological phases of matter from Euclidean to non-Euclidean spaces. However, prior work has mostly focused on spatial topological states at the single outer edge of type-I hyperbolic lattices. The dynamic transfer of hyperbolic topological states across multiple edges, as well as the emergence of spatiotemporal topological phenomena, remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish both spatial and spatiotemporal topologies in a newly discovered type-II hyperbolic lattice possessing outer and inner edges. Using electric circuits, we experimentally realize a type-II hyperbolic Chern insulator and directly observe degenerate chiral edge states of opposite chirality at its outer and inner edges. Furthermore, by coupling these counter-propagating chiral edge states, we demonstrate an anti-time-parity phase transition, enabling dynamic transfer between them in arbitrary proportions. Finally, we propose a novel paradigm for constructing a (2+1)-dimensional hyperbolic space-time crystal, which hosts an intertwined topology of spatial Chern and temporal winding numbers, resulting in a unique space-time topological string state. Our work expands the frontier of hyperbolic topological physics, paving the way for the spatiotemporal dynamic manipulation of hyperbolic topological states.

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an efficient spectral compression technique for optical laser fields.

This method also features precise and continuous tunability of the central wavelength. Furthermore, we directly extend this scheme to an ambient air medium, realizing a simple high-energy femtosecond laser spectral tuning apparatus. The developed technique has promising applications in advanced manufacturing, bio-imaging, and material spectroscopic studies.

Abstract: Oscillations are ubiquitous wave phenomena in physical systems ranging from electromagnetic and acoustic to gravitational waves. The behavior of finite-size systems is traditionally understood to be governed by fundamental oscillatory modes arising from bulk physics and boundary conditions. A paradigmatic example is the particle-in-a-box model introduced with the advent of quantum mechanics, in which confinement leads to discrete resonances and quantized energy levels. Such quantization underpins phenomena including semiconductor quantum dots, where electronic waves are confined in all three spatial dimensions, producing standing-wave modes analogous to the vibrational states of a guitar string. These modes are characterized by integer quantum numbers corresponding to the number of envelope oscillations fitting within the cavity. Recently, counter-intuitive modes have been observed in finite systems with Dirac dispersion, including states that do not oscillate spatially, yet a general theoretical framework for modes in such cavities has been lacking. Here, we discover the phenomenon of arbitrary fractional quantization in wave physics and show that, in finite-size boxes with linear dispersion, the quantum number need not be an integer but can take any real value, including zero. Using Bloch theory in a Dirac-cone photonic crystal with a controllable fractional number of unit cells at its boundaries, we demonstrate continuous control of the cavity-mode envelope wavenumber. We introduce a unified nomenclature for these unconventional modes and derive their corresponding wavefunctions. These counter-intuitive states in open Dirac potentials challenge conventional notions of quantization and open new avenues across wave physics.

Abstract: Accurately determining the underlying physical parameters of individual elements in integrated photonics is increasingly difficult as device architectures become more complex. Inferring these parameters directly from spectral measurements of the system as a whole provides a practical alternative to traditional calibration, allowing characterization of photonic systems without relying on detailed device-specific models. Here, we introduce a supervised machine-learning strategy to learn the onsite losses and resonant frequency shifts of each individual ring in an array of coupled ring resonators from measured spectral power distributions of the whole array. The neural network infers these parameters with high accuracy across multiple experimental configurations. Our methodology provides a scalable and non-invasive method for extracting intrinsic parameters in coupled photonic platforms, paving the way for future development of automated calibration and control methods.

Abstract: Photonic molecules can mimic interactions of atomic energy levels, offering new ways to manipulate cavity eigenstates. Current methods using evanescent coupling of multiple cavities face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and coupling control, especially for complex systems. Here we introduce a new method that uses a single multimode optical ring resonator to create photonic molecules. Our design uses multiple waveguide transverse modes in one resonator, providing flexibility to engineer complex interactions without typical coupling constraints. We demonstrate arbitrary inter-mode coupling through transmissive mode converters, allowing precise tuning of resonance splitting and intrinsic losses. This approach enables selective bright-dark mode pair generation and the exploration of novel photonic phenomena such as exceptional points. This multimode photonic molecule overcomes traditional limitations and offers new possibilities for integrated photonic circuits, optical processing, and studies in non-Hermitian and nonlinear photonics.

Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) has become a standard technique for producing attosecond XUV pulses in the laboratory, yet the high flux necessary for nonlinear XUV photoionization remains accessible to only a few research groups. Here, we introduce the SYLOS Compact high-harmonic beamline at ELI ALPS, specifically designed to provide the flux required for non-linear optics in the XUV. We present a detailed characterization of the beam line demonstrating its capability to generate and utilize both intense attosecond pulse trains and isolated attosecond pulses. We further showcase the two-XUV-photon double ionization of neon (Ne) and argon (Ar), achieved in a user campaign. The results underscore the beamline's capability to support cutting-edge attosecond experiments and investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics on the attosecond scale.

Abstract: We explore the existence and stability of exceptional points (EPs) in finite waveguide arrays subject to single-site dissipation. We show that the EP landscape is dictated by a geometry-dependent parity effect, leading to strictly distinct spectral behaviors for arrays with even versus odd numbers of waveguides. Through analytical derivation and numerical analysis, we define the conditions under which these singularities emerge and evolve. Our findings clarify the mechanisms of symmetry breaking in finite non-Hermitian lattices, offering new guidelines for the design of robust optical structures that exploit or avoid exceptional points.

TL;DR: 该论文指出，渐近安全计划在量子引力中假设在短波极限下存在UV固定点，但由于一般协变性和BRST对称性的破坏，该计划在四个独立标准下均失败，导致度量张量在超过引力能标下失效。

Result: 度量张量在高能标下失效，渐近安全计划在量子引力中面临根本性挑战。

Conclusion: 渐近安全计划在量子引力中不可行，需要新的框架。

Abstract: The asymptotic safety program assumes that quantum gravity becomes renormalizable through ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based couplings. We demonstrate that this approach {encounters fundamental symmetry violations} across multiple independent criteria, all traceable to a single fundamental cause: the breakdown of general covariance and BRST symmetries above the gravitational cutoff scale. Rigorous canonical quantization proves that general covariance cannot be maintained quantum mechanically in dimensions greater than two, while recent path integral calculations reveal persistent gauge parameter dependence in quantum gravitational corrections, signaling BRST symmetry violation. These dual proofs establish that the metric tensor ceases to exist as a valid quantum degree of freedom above $Λ_{\text{grav}}$$\sim$$10^{18}$ GeV, rendering the search for ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based theories {problematic from a foundational physical perspective}. We provide comprehensive analysis demonstrating that asymptotic safety exhibits persistent gauge parameter dependence where fixed-point properties vary with arbitrary gauge choices, non-convergent truncation schemes extending to the 35th order showing no approach to stable values, experimental {tensions} with electroweak precision tests by orders of magnitude, matter content requirements incompatible with the Standard Model, absence of concrete graviton predictions due to gauge and truncation dependence, unitarity {challenges} through ghost instabilities and propagator negativity, and fundamental Wick rotation obstructions preventing reliable connection between Euclidean calculations and physical Lorentzian spacetime. We contrast this with the Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity framework that systematically avoids all asymptotic safety pathologies.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the geodesics of pp-wave spacetimes with polynomial profiles of degrees $3\leq n\leq10$, which are dynamically equivalent to the motion of a classical particle in a two-dimensional harmonic polynomial potential. By analysing the escape basins associated with different asymptotic outcomes, we show that all basins exhibit the Wada property for every polynomial degree considered. We further compute the basin entropy $S_{b}$, finding that it increases monotonically with the polynomial degree, indicating enhanced unpredictability of the final state of the system. The boundary basin entropy $S_{bb}$ is also evaluated, and the $\ln(2)$ criterion confirms that the basin boundaries are fractal for $n>3$. We conjecture that the Wada property persists for polynomial degrees $n>10$.

Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity, a symmetric teleparallel theory featuring non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter. Adopting a linear functional form $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m) = -α\mathscr{Q} + 2\mathscr{L}_m + β$, we derive the field equations for a static, spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne wormhole geometry with vanishing redshift function. Four distinct shape functions are considered: $b(r)=\sqrt{r_0 r}$, $b(r)=r_0\left(\dfrac{r}{r_0}\right)^γ$ (with $0<γ<1$), and $b(r)=\dfrac{r_0 \ln (r+1)}{\ln (r_0+1)}$. The geometric viability of each configuration is verified through standard traversability conditions, including the flaring-out requirement and asymptotic flatness. We analyze the energy conditions and demonstrate that, consistent with known results in wormhole physics, the null energy condition is violated in the vicinity of the throat, indicating the presence of exotic matter. In addition, we employ embedding diagrams to visualize the spatial geometry of the wormhole solutions, providing a clear geometric interpretation of the flaring-out condition at the throat. Our results suggest that $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework for constructing traversable wormholes, with the non-minimal matter-geometry coupling influencing both the geometry and the matter sector.

In this recent paper, information about what lies inside a boundary is encoded onto it, meaning that in this approach the information directly leaks from the horizon to the bulk in the form of Hawking radiations.

Abstract: Metric-affine gravity (GL(4) gauge theory) in 4-dimensions is coupled to a spacetime Dirac source field using the isomorphisms of the Lie algebra gl(4) to the Clifford algebras Cl(3,1) and Cl(2,2). A simple transformation relates the generators of Cl(3,1) to a real representation of Cl(2,2), while the real representation of Cl(2,2) serves directly as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(4). Therefore, although GL(4) does not contain a spinor representation of the Lorentz group, expanding its Lie algebra in the Cl(2,2) basis gives a Clifford valued connection with well-defined coupling to Dirac spinors. Variation of the expansion coefficients gives new Dirac sources for both torsion and nonmetricity, separated by identifying the so(3,1) basis within the gl(4) basis.

Abstract: We investigate exact cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity. For an extended Higgs-like scalar self-interaction, we find that the resulting field equations belong to the damped Ermakov-Painlevé II class and construct novel analytical solutions within the framework of the Chiellini integrability condition. We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \gtrsim 70 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $Λ$CDM cosmology. The results indicate that Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies are capable of providing a robust and analytically controlled framework for modeling late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing, offering a viable alternative to phenomenological dark-energy parametrizations.

Abstract: The continual production of long wavelength scalars and gravitons during inflation injects secular growth into loop corrections which would be constant in flat space. One typically finds that each additional factor of the loop counting parameter can induce up to a certain number of logarithms of the scale factor. Loop corrections that attain this number are known as ``leading logarithms''; those with fewer are sub-leading. Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models. We show that the first sub-leading logarithm is captured by applying the stochastic formalism to a certain part of the 1-loop effective potential. This is checked at 2-loops for a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction on de Sitter background.

Motivation: Exploring alternative gravity theories to resolve tensions in cosmological parameters.

Method: Applied Nash's embedding theorem to model scalar metric perturbations, used CMB, BAO, and SN Ia data for analysis.

Result: Good fit to data, H0≈69.32 km/s/Mpc, S8≈0.76, potential alleviation of H0 and S8 tensions.

Conclusion: Nash gravity shows promise as an alternative to ΛCDM, especially for resolving H0 and S8 tensions.

Abstract: We here investigate the observational viability of Nash gravity as an alternative to the standard $Λ$CDM cosmology. Based on Nash's embedding theorem, the model introduces orthogonal perturbations via variations in the extrinsic curvature, generating scalar-type metric perturbations directly from geometry, without the need to introduce additional fields. We confront the model with current observational data, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, and recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) compilations. Our analysis shows that Nash gravity provides a good fit to the data, yielding a slightly higher value for the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 69.32 \pm 0.72$ km/s/Mpc, compared to the $Λ$CDM model, thus offering a potential alleviation of the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, the model naturally predicts a suppressed growth of structure, with $S_8 \approx 0.76$ across various joint analyses, potentially alleviating the so-called $S_8$ tension, assuming that this discrepancy is not solely due to systematic effects in other independent measurements. In some cases, Nash gravity achieves a better fit to the data than the $Λ$CDM paradigm at the $2σ$ level.

Abstract: We investigate tidal forces, geodesic deviation, and tidal disruption in the black hole spacetime described by the Kalb-Ramond-ModMax solution, where electromagnetic nonlinearity is governed by the parameter $γ$ and Lorentz symmetry violation by the parameter $l$. In the canonical sector ($α=1$), the radial tidal force exhibits a transition marked by a sign inversion between the horizons $r_{-}$ and $r_+$, signaling internal regimes of radial compression analogous to those of charged black holes; the parameter $l$ controls the strength and location of this transition, while $γ$ regulates the nonlinear electromagnetic contribution. The angular tidal force is predominantly compressive, $l$ shaping the effective geometry, and $γ$ acting as a damping factor. In the phantom sector ($α=-1$), tidal forces and geodesic deviation diverge, indicating a tidal instability, with $l$ and $γ$ affecting only the magnitude of the response. We further show that $l$ shifts the relation between the horizon radius $r_+$ and the tidal disruption radius $r_{\rm Roche}$, thereby modifying the critical (Hills) mass defined by $r_{\rm Roche}=r_+$. Tidal disruption of neutron stars occurs inside the horizon for supermassive black holes, whereas Sun-like stars are disrupted outside the horizon, with $γ$ becoming relevant only for ultramassive black holes with masses $\sim 10^{8}M_{\odot}$. Our results demonstrate that Kalb-Ramon-ModMax effects are largely suppressed for supermassive black holes, but may be relevant for intermediate-mass systems and observable tidal disruption events, offering an indirect probe of Lorentz violation and nonlinear electrodynamics in the strong-field regime.

TL;DR: The study integrates a pseudocomplex version of the FLRW model into pseudocomplex General Relativity to explain dark energy as a geometric effect, deriving a time-dependent Hubble parameter and using DESI BAO data to constrain parameters matching Lambda CDM predictions. They compute a redshift drift compatible with these models and propose future observational tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring alternative gravitational theories and their implications for dark energy and cosmic acceleration is a key area of theoretical physics. Understanding the geometric origins of dark energy could provide new insights into the universe's accelerating expansion.

Method: The researchers developed a pseudocomplex FLRW model within pcGR framework, derived equations for the Hubble parameter and dark energy equation of state, and employed recent DESI BAO data for parameter fitting and redshift drift calculation.

Result: The study finds a best-fit beta value of 1.0426, leading to a present-day Hubble acceleration H0 ~ 0.94E-17 (km/s²)/Mpc. The predicted redshift drift over 20 years at z=4 is approximately -11.1 cm/s, aligning closely with Lambda CDM predictions. This suggests that pseudocomplex GR could be a viable alternative to standard Lambda CDM in explaining cosmic acceleration.

Conclusion: This work advances the pseudocomplex GR framework as a geometrically motivated alternative to explain dark energy. The close alignment of predicted redshift drift with Lambda CDM supports its validity while offering a testable prediction for future high-precision observations, such as measuring redshift drift over extended periods and at high redshifts.

Abstract: The pseudocomplex version of the FLRW model is presented within the framework of pseudocomplex General Relativity (pcGR).

Abstract: The accurate computation of quasinormal modes from rotating black holes beyond general relativity is crucial for testing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. In this study, we assess the accuracy of the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting the quasinormal mode spectrum of a scalar field on a deformed Kerr spacetime. To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation.

TL;DR: Derives a closed-form approximate expression for the Kerr black hole shadow's equivalent diameter, achieving sub-percent accuracy in practical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constructing a mathematical model for the Kerr black hole shadow's diameter simplifies complex geometrical and relativistic calculations, enhancing efficiency in theoretical and observational studies.

Method: The method integrates a polar analytical component with an exponential correction comprising a 15-parameter polynomial. The parameters are optimized through ordinary least squares on a grid derived from the Kerr critical-curve area.

Result: The surrogate achieves exceptional accuracy with a median absolute percent error of 0.0105% and up to 1.64% in validation, enabling quick evaluations crucial for parameter inference and model comparisons.

Conclusion: This approach bridges theoreticalpredictions with observational data efficiently, offering a valuable tool in black hole physics and astrophysics.

Abstract: We present a closed-form surrogate for the equivalent diameter of the Kerr black-hole shadow, defined as the diameter of the circle with the same area as the shadow's critical curve. The construction enforces the exact face-on (polar) limit by explicitly separating an analytically computed polar contribution based on the spherical photon-orbit branch where the horizontal impact parameter vanishes. The remaining inclination dependence is captured by a compact 15-parameter polynomial placed inside an exponential correction. The coefficients are determined by ordinary least squares on a deterministic reference grid generated from the Kerr critical-curve area. Over the practical domain of dimensionless spin from 0 to 0.998 and inclination from just above 0 degrees up to 90 degrees (with the exactly polar point treated analytically), the surrogate achieves sub-percent accuracy. On the training grid the median absolute percent error is 0.0105 percent with a worst case of 0.782 percent, and on a denser out-of-sample validation set (including inclinations down to 0.5 degrees) the median, 95th-percentile, and worst-case errors are 0.023 percent, 0.471 percent, and 1.64 percent, respectively. The resulting expression provides fast evaluations of the shadow size without numerical ray tracing, making it convenient for repeated calls in parameter inference and rapid model comparisons.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inflationary dynamics of the $β$-exponential potential model, where a scalar field couples to quadratic $(R + R^2)$ gravity. In this model, the inflaton is the field that determines the size of the extra dimension. We employ the Palatini formalism to derive the resulting Einstein-frame generalized $k$-inflation effective theory, which we analyze under the assumption that the constant-roll condition is satisfied.
  We scan the parameter space for inflationary predictions, specifically the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, ensuring consistency with the results from ACT DR6. The compliant regions are depicted accordingly. For a suitable range of the model parameters, the values obtained for the inflationary observables align with the most recent observations by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration and/or the Planck mission.

Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptional gravitational-wave event consistent with the merger of two massive, highly-spinning black holes. Reliable inference of the source properties is crucial for accurate interpretation of its astrophysical implications. However, characterization of GW231123 is challenging: only few signal cycles are observed and different signal models result in systematically different parameters. We investigate whether the interpretation of GW231123 is robust against model systematics and Gaussian detector noise. We show that the model systematics observed in GW231123 can be reproduced for a simulated signal based on the numerical-relativity surrogate model NRSur7dq4. Simulating data using the maximum-likelihood NRSur7dq4 waveform for GW231123 and no noise realization, we closely recover the systematics observed for the real signal. We then explore how the headline properties of GW231123 are impacted by Gaussian detector noise. Using the NRSur7dq4 maximum-likelihood waveform and different noise realizations, we consistently find support for large masses, high spin magnitudes (median $χ_1\geq 0.7$), and high spin precession (median $χ_\mathrm{p}\geq 0.68$). The spin in the direction of the angular momentum ($χ_\mathrm{eff}$) fluctuates more. Finally, again comparing to simulated signals, we show that any differences in the GW231123 inference based on each separate detector are not statistically significant. These results show that the properties of GW231123, and most importantly the high mass and high spin magnitudes inferred by NRSur7dq4, are robust.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators provide a powerful platform for realizing strongly correlated phases, enabling access to dynamical signatures of quasiparticles and symmetry breaking processes. Motivated by recent observations of quantum phases in flux-frustrated ladders with non-vanishing ground state currents, we investigate interacting bosons on the dimerized BBH lattice in two dimensions-originally introduced in the context of higher-order topology. After mapping out the phase diagram, which includes vortex superfluid (V-SF), vortex Mott insulator (V-MI), and featureless Mott insulator (MI) phases, we focus on the integer filling case. There, the MI/V-SF transition simultaneously breaks the $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ and U(1) symmetries, where $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ corresponds to time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Using a slave-boson description, we resolve the excitation spectrum across the transition and uncover a chiral Higgs mode whose mass softens at criticality, providing a dynamical hallmark of emergent chirality that we numerically probe via quench dynamics. Our results establish an experimentally realistic setting for probing unconventional TRS-broken phases and quasiparticles with intrinsic chirality in strongly interacting quantum matter.

Conclusion: 提出了在无定形晶格中调控和实现强局域GS的基础理论，为应用于实际场景提供了指导。

Abstract: Gap solitons (GSs) bifurcating from flat bands, which may be represented in terms of Wannier functions, have garnered significant interest due to their strong localization with extremely small norms. Moiré lattices (MLs), with multiple flat bands, offer an appropriate platform for creating such solitons. We explore the formation mechanism and stability of GSs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an ML potential. We identify five Wannier-type GS families bifurcating from the lowest five energy bands in the spectrum induced by the ML with sufficiently large period and depth. These fundamental GSs serve as basic elements for constructing more complex Wannier-type GS states. Reducing the lattice period and depth triggers a transition from the Wannier-type GSs to ones of the Bloch type, the latter exhibiting higher norm thresholds and pronounced spatial broadening near edges of the energy bands. In addition to tuning the lattice-potential parameters, adjusting the SOC strength can also modulate the flatness of energy bands and enhance the localization of gap solitons, enabling reversible transitions between the GSs of the Wannier and Bloch types. Distinctive properties of GSs in the quasiperiodic ML are uncovered too. Thus, we propose the theoretical foundation for the creation of and manipulations with strongly localized GSs.

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和改善 memristor 设备性能提供了新方法，并为制造高记忆能力的 memristor 设备奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the present work we describe a way to assess memory capability of real devices, while proposing to the engineering community what to pursue to create devices with deep associated memory capability. The study of the signal produced by a real memristor nano-device focused on the description in terms of the Landau φ4 theory for the critical phenomena in finite systems. This further allowed the utilization of the property of the anomalous enhancement of the autocorrelation function when a system is on the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), for improving the quantity of the demonstrated memory, while simultaneously maintaining a very good quality, as this is expressed by the stability of the autocorrelation function. In this proof-of-concept case, the morphology of the signal allowed us to impose the appropriate modifications on the signal so that we finally show how to get very close to the characteristics of the SSB and thus achieve our goal to get as close as possible to the ideal behavior of a Memristor that yields deep memory. Finally, we provide proof of the stability of memristor's operation by showing that solitons "follow" as a skeleton structure the experimentally derived time series.

The discrete Mikhailov model is a coupled system, in which one equation comes from the compatibility of the two Miura transformations, the other is transformed from the discrete negative order Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur system by using the Miura transformations. Explicit solutions, including solitons and multiple-pole solutions, are presented via two Cauchy matrix schemes respectively, namely, the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur type and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili type. By straight continuum limits, semi-discrete and continuous Mikhailov models together with their Cauchy matrix structures and solutions are recovered.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficient resolution of neuroinflammation and debris clearance is a key determinant of successful central nervous system regeneration. Regenerative vertebrates such as Danio rerio often exhibit faster immune resolution and debris clearance than mammals, yet the molecular determinants underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) and their ligands Gas6 and Protein S are central regulators of phagocytosis and immune resolution in the nervous system, but whether intrinsic structural properties of these receptor-ligand complexes contribute to regenerative efficiency has not been systematically explored.
  Here, we present a comparative in silico analysis of TAM receptors and ligands from zebrafish, human, and mouse, integrating sequence evolution, high-confidence structural modeling, interface characterization, and electrostatic analysis. Despite substantial sequence divergence, ligand-binding domains display strong structural conservation, supporting a conserved global mode of TAM-ligand engagement. At the interface level, zebrafish complexes show enhanced electrostatic contributions and increased salt-bridge density, particularly in the Tyro3-Protein S interaction. Residue-level electrostatic analysis reveals clustered interface hotspots that are spatially conserved across species despite evolutionary rewiring of individual contacts.
  Together, these results suggest that TAM receptor-ligand interfaces are evolutionarily tuned through subtle electrostatic and geometric optimization rather than large-scale structural changes, providing a conserved yet adaptable framework for species-specific modulation of phagocytic signaling.

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper characterizes the material properties of a rotator cuff tendon using full volume datasets to study its behavior under tension. They used a novel approach called variational system identification (VSI) to model the tendon's stress and strain, comparing three constitutive models: neo-Hookean, modified Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO), and a reduced polynomial model. The HGO model was the most accurate, while the neo-Hookean model failed to capture shear behavior. The simplified polynomial model performed comparably to the HGO model. The study suggests that current models can capture key trends but lack the complexity needed for detailed predictive simulations of injury and repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanical behavior of tendons is crucial for developing accurate models to predict injury and repair. This study aims to improve constitutive models for clinical-grade simulations.

Method: The researchers used full volume datasets to capture internal strain behavior in the tendons. They implemented a variational system identification (VSI) approach to solve the stress equilibrium equation. Three constitutive models (neo-Hookean, modified HGO, and reduced polynomial) were compared. Parameter inference and refinement were done using an adjoint-based PDE-constrained optimization framework.

Result: The modified HGO model showed the best accuracy in capturing the tendon's deformation mechanisms, including shear behavior, which the neo-Hookean model failed to reproduce. The reduced polynomial model performed comparably to the modified HGO model using only three terms.

Conclusion: The study highlights that while current constitutive models can capture key trends in tendon behavior, they lack the complexity needed to fully replicate the tendon's internal mechanics. Continued model development is necessary to enable clinical-grade predictive simulations of tendon injury and repair.

Abstract: In this work, we characterized the material properties of an animal model of the rotator cuff tendon using full volume datasets of both its intact and injured states by capturing internal strain behavior throughout the tendon. Our experimental setup, involving tension along the fiber direction, activated volumetric, tensile, and shear mechanisms due to the tendon's complex geometry. We implemented an approach to model inference that we refer to as variational system identification (VSI) to solve the weak form of the stress equilibrium equation using these full volume displacements. Three constitutive models were used for parameter inference: a neo-Hookean model, a modified Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model with higher-order terms in the first and second invariants, and a reduced polynomial model consisting of terms based on the first, second, and fiber-related invariants. Inferred parameters were further refined using an adjoint-based partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization framework. Our results show that the modified HGO model captures the tendon's deformation mechanisms with reasonable accuracy, while the neo-Hookean model fails to reproduce key internal features, particularly the shear behavior in the injured tendon. Surprisingly, the simplified polynomial model performed comparably to the modified HGO formulation using only three terms. These findings suggest that while current constitutive models do not fully replicate the complex internal mechanics of the tendon, they are capable of capturing key trends in both intact and damaged tissue, using a homogeneous modeling approach. Continued model development is needed to bridge this gap and enable clinical-grade, predictive simulations of tendon injury and repair.

Abstract: Real-time data filtering and selection -- or trigger -- systems at high-throughput scientific facilities such as the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) must process extremely high-rate data streams under stringent bandwidth, latency, and storage constraints. Yet these systems are typically designed as static, hand-tuned menus of selection criteria grounded in prior knowledge and simulation. In this work, we further explore the concept of a self-driving trigger, an autonomous data-filtering framework that reallocates resources and adjusts thresholds dynamically in real-time to optimize signal efficiency, rate stability, and computational cost as instrumentation and environmental conditions evolve. We introduce a benchmark ecosystem to emulate realistic collider scenarios and demonstrate real-time optimization of a menu including canonical energy sum triggers as well as modern anomaly-detection algorithms that target non-standard event topologies using machine learning. Using simulated data streams and publicly available collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, we demonstrate the capability to dynamically and automatically optimize trigger performance under specific cost objectives without manual retuning. Our adaptive strategy shifts trigger design from static menus with heuristic tuning to intelligent, automated, data-driven control, unlocking greater flexibility and discovery potential in future high-energy physics analyses.

Result: KL01 设备在低温下表现出了较低的漏电流和优异的能量分辨率，证实了工艺的可行性和材料的兼容性。

Conclusion: 本研究为 Future-Li 制备环形接触模块提供了实用的制备流程。

Abstract: Rare-event searches including dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$ν$NS), and neutrinoless double-beta decay (0$νββ$) require high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors with ultralow noise, stable backgrounds, and electrode geometries that can scale to larger single-crystal masses. Ring-contact (ring-and-groove) designs address scalability by shaping the electric field to preserve low-capacitance readout, but their nonplanar topology motivates a lithium-contact process that is compatible with conformal deposition and robust high-voltage operation. As a process demonstration toward future ring-contact prototypes, we fabricate and characterize a hybrid-contact planar HPGe device, KL01. Here, ``hybrid'' denotes an $n^{+}$ contact formed by an in-house lithium-suspension paint followed by controlled thermal diffusion, combined with an AJA-developed a-Ge/Al $p^{+}$ contact and a-Ge sidewall passivation. At 77~K the device exhibits pA-scale leakage current under kV bias, a depletion plateau near $V_{\mathrm{dep}}\approx 1300$~V, and energy resolutions of 1.57~keV FWHM at 59.5~keV and 2.57~keV FWHM at 662~keV. These results validate the compatibility of the paint-and-diffuse lithium process with thin-film a-Ge/Al contacts and establish a practical fabrication workflow to be extended to ring-and-groove electrodes for next-generation rare-event HPGe modules.

Motivation: The research aims to create a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome limitations in catalysis research, particularly for fast RIXS measurements without sample damage.

Method: Fabrication on Si membranes via SOI, readout by bending a chip portion, integration with SQUID circuits, verification through laser energy resolution models.

Result: The detector models and energy resolution are validated, showing the viability for deployment at NSLS-II.

Conclusion: The all-silicon design enhances efficiency and integration, positioning for readout supports high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy applications.

Abstract: We present the electro-thermal characterization of transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors suspended on Si membranes fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer.
  This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies. The new instrument will allow for fast RIXS measurements to be made without causing sample damage. We verify the detector models and measure the energy resolution using a pulsed optical laser, demonstrating the viability of this approach for the final instrument to be deployed at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).

TL;DR: The paper discusses the design and testing of a SiPM-based dual-radiator RICH detector for the ePIC experiment. It highlights the radiation hardness of the detector components under proton irradiation, identifies at least one component (ATtiny417 microcontroller) that failed, and emphasizes the need for SEU mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiation hardness is critical for space and high radiation environments, and this paper investigates the reliability of a newly developed detector component under such conditions.

Method: The authors tested the radiation tolerance of key components of the RDO card (including ATtiny417 microcontroller) by subjecting them to proton irradiation. They measured TID, SEU rates, and functional degradation over time.

Result: All tested components except ATtiny417 showed radiation tolerance exceeding expected TID levels. The ATtiny417 exhibited destructive failure, and the observed SEU rates necessitate mitigation in system design.

Conclusion: Radiation testing confirmed the detector components' ability to operate in harsh radiation environments, with a clear exception for ATtiny417. Future efforts should focus on improving the reliability of the ATtiny417 and implementing mitigative strategies to address SEU rates.

Abstract: The dual-radiator RICH detector of the ePIC experiment will employ over 300000 SiPM pixels as photosensors, organized into more than 1000 Photon Detection Units. Each PDU is a compact module, approximately 5x5x12 cm^3 in size, including four custom ASICs connected to 256 SiPMs and an FPGA-based readout card (RDO) responsible for data acquisition and control. Considering the moderately harsh radiation environment expected in the dRICH detector, this study reports on proton irradiation tests performed on key components of the RDO card to assess their tolerance to cumulative Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effects (SEE). All tested components demonstrated radiation tolerance beyond the TID levels expected for the dRICH environment, with the exception of the ATtiny417 microcontroller, which showed destructive failure. Furthermore, as expected, the observed Single Event Upset (SEU) rates call for appropriate mitigation strategies in the final system design.

### [82] [A theory of state-to-state transitions based on the framework of classical reaction dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09187)
*Kento Kasahara,Ryo Okabe,Chia-en A. Chang,Toshifumi mori,Nobuyuki Matubayasi*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A novel method for studying population dynamics in configurational states is developed, incorporating continuous-time descriptions of state transitions and Markov approximations for boundary crossings. Integral equations are derived, enabling long-term trajectory computations with significantly reduced time scales compared to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The method is successfully applied to binding/unbinding kinetics involving CH₄/CH₄, Na⁺/Cl⁻, and crown ether/K⁺ systems in water, demonstrating accuracy comparable to brute-force MD at a fraction of the computational expense for certain systems, particularly those with long timescales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the kinetics and population dynamics of complex molecular systems, especially those involving binding and unbinding processes, is crucial in various fields of chemistry and materials science. Traditional MD simulations often struggle with long timescales, making it difficult to study slow processes. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a more efficient method.

Method: The authors developed a theoretical framework based on the Liouville equation, which governs the time evolution of probability density in continuous-time state transitions. They introduced a Markov approximation for transitions across state boundaries, leading to tractable integral equations. These equations were solved using short-time MD simulations to compute the necessary time-dependent quantities, significantly reducing the required simulation times.

Result: The method was validated by applying it to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH₄/CH₄, Na⁺/Cl⁻, and crown ether/K⁺ systems in water. The results showed that the estimated time constants were almost identical to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. Notably, for the crown ether/K⁺ system, the required MD trajectory timescales were reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude, enabling the study of complex systems with timescales far beyond the reach of conventional MD simulations.

Conclusion: This work presents a promising approach for studying population dynamics in complex molecular systems with long timescales. By combining the Liouville equation with a Markov approximation, the method achieves significant computational efficiency, making it a valuable tool for analyzing slow processes in chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: We propose a new method to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states based on a continuous-time description of state-to-state transitions. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, the probability density associate d with a given state obeys the Li ouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply the present method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the present method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the present method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to
  complex binding and unbinding sy stems whose characteristic timescales a re far beyond those directly acce ssible by brute-force MD simulati ons.

Conclusion: 多光子增益态猫态为量子成像提供了良好的资源，其性质受光子数增加的影响显著，但可通过现有技术实现。

Abstract: Multi-photon-added cat states are constructed by repeatedly applying the creation operator to a cat state. We study in detail their photon-number distribution, $Q$ parameter, squeezing properties, and Wigner function. We show that photon addition induces a $π$ phase shift in the original parity configuration whenever an odd number of photons is added, reflected as swapped vanishing probabilities and phase space displacements at the origin. Remarkably, the same process drives these states into a sub-Poissonian regime regardless of the relative phase between their coherent state components, making them valuable resources for quantum imaging, at the cost of losing quadrature squeezing, but gaining amplitude-squared one. We also discuss how these states can be generated using existing hardware.

Abstract: Rapid and programmable shaping of light fields is central to modern microscopy, display technologies, optical communications and sensing, quantum engineering, and quantum information processing. Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental dichotomy: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but suffer from low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted optical beam geometries. Though recent advances in photonic integrated circuits achieve fast switching, there is currently no tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over a set of diffraction-limited spots. Here we introduce a new class of spatial light modulator that provides both 2D pixel geometry and high speed. The device operates by encoding spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator, and decoding them via a first-of-its-kind, high-resolution 2D spectrometer. The spectrometer, based on the architecture which we call the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA), achieves its sensitivity through long path-lengths, enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides. We demonstrate site-resolved optical pulsing with a 44(1)~ns rise time, corresponding to frame rates exceeding 10 million frames per second, as well as arbitrary, reconfigurable 2D addressing and multi-site operations, including asynchronous, independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination. Leveraging these tools opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation of matter across science, from fast, scalable control that approaches the inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, to dynamically programmable, microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging.

Abstract: Scale invariance in quantum mechanics can be broken in several ways. A well-known example is the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance, whose typical realization is the Efimov effect of three-body problems. Here we discuss yet another discrete symmetry to which continuous scale invariance can be broken: discrete phase invariance. We first revisit the one-body problem on the half line in the presence of an inverse-square potential -- the simplest example of nontrivial scale-invariant quantum mechanics -- and show that continuous scale invariance can be broken to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant. We also show that discrete phase invariance manifests itself as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of the S-matrix. We then present three examples of few-body problems that exhibit discrete phase invariance. These examples are the one-body Aharonov-Bohm problem, a two-body problem of nonidentical particles in two dimensions, and a three-body problem of nonidentical particles in one dimension, all of which contain a codimension-two ``magnetic'' flux in configuration spaces.

Abstract: We demonstrate superadditivity of one-shot zero-error classical capacity in an asymmetric communication setting where a noisy classical channel is used in parallel with a perfect quantum channel. Each channel individually supports only a fixed number of perfectly distinguishable messages. Their joint use enables transmission of strictly more messages than permitted by the product of the individual capacities. We present explicit constructions achieving this enhancement and establish that replacing the perfect quantum channel with a perfect classical channel eliminates the effect. Finally, we identify a structural criterion on the noisy channel governing this effect and show that the quantum advantage is rooted in Kochen-Specker contextuality.

Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis explains thermalization in isolated quantum systems through the statistical properties of observables in the energy eigenbasis. We investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, establishing a direct correspondence between the spectral correlations of the Hamiltonian and local observables expressed in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking. By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this correspondence persists even in a partially ergodic regime, indicating that the emergence of chaos is already encoded locally within the observables' matrix structure and that small blocks are sufficient to capture the underlying spectral correlations.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is addressing the challenge of nondestructive measurement in quantum systems, particularly in bialkali molecule platforms.

Conclusion: This approach provides a promising technique for nondestructive state measurement in molecular qubits, contributing to advancements in quantum information science.

Abstract: Tweezer arrays of polar molecules present new opportunities for quantum science and quantum information. However, a major challenge, especially in bialkali molecule platforms, is the fact that current measurement schemes for the internal states are destructive. In this work, we present a method to use Rydberg atoms to nondestructively measure the internal state of a molecular qubit. We achieve this via microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms, allowing us to tune the interactions so that there are minimal Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and many measurements can take place simultaneously. We consider two experimentally-motivated examples of detecting $^{23}$Na$^{133}$Cs and $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs with $^{133}$Cs atoms. Finally, we discuss several strategies for mitigating various sources of crosstalk.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses extremal non-signaling (ENS) boxes in Bell scenarios, highlighting their non-physical nature under quantum theory but their importance in addressing problems in Bell nonlocality. They were able to derive these boxes in arbitrary bipartite scenarios and offered insights into foundational principles, revealing violations of exclusivity and Specker's principles with two copies. Additionally, they decomposed the magic square correlation into ENS boxes and identified scenarios where communication is insufficient to simulate these boxes, suggesting new avenues for research in nonlocality theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study of ENS boxes lies in their role in Bell nonlocality and foundational questions in quantum theory. The understanding of these boxes deepens insights into nonlocality mechanisms and their practical implications.

Method: The authors explored ENS boxes in various Bell scenarios, starting with bivariate systems and moving to higher dimensions. They determined the complete list for unexplored scenarios and utilized analytical methods, such as decomposition of the magic square, and considered system communications.

Result: The investigation yielded that two copies of any ENS box violate exclusivity and Specker's principles, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and observable phenomena. Furthermore, they presented foundational results about simulating ENS boxes with limited communication, which leads to new research directions in quantum communication and information theory.

Conclusion: The discovery of ENS boxes in arbitrary Bell scenarios and related advancements suggest new methods for tackling problems in nonlocality theory and advancing quantum communication and information theory. However, there remain questions about higher-dimensional systems and computational limits, indicating future research directions.

Abstract: Extremal non-signaling (ENS) boxes are correlations that correspond to vertices of the non-signaling polytope of a Bell scenario. Neither quantum theory nor any theory for ideal measurements allows for ENS boxes. That is, according to quantum theory, ENS boxes are nonphysical. Still, ENS boxes are crucial for addressing a number of problems in Bell nonlocality. Here, we obtain ENS boxes in arbitrary bipartite Bell scenarios and present the complete list of ENS boxes for several unexplored scenarios. Equipped with the boxes, we revisit several foundational questions. We find that already two copies of any ENS box violate the exclusivity (or local orthogonality) and Specker's principles. We provide the minimal decomposition of the magic square correlation - the simplest known perfect correlation in nature - in terms of ENS boxes. We identify the minimal scenario in which a dit of communication (with d < 6) is insufficient to simulate ENS boxes. Our results show that the ENS boxes approach leads to new results and opens new avenues for research.

Abstract: A recent advancement in quantum computing shows a quantum advantage of certified randomness on the racetrack processor. This work investigates the execution efficiency of this architecture for general-purpose programs. We first explore the impact of increasing zones on runtime efficiency. Counterintuitively, our evaluations using variational programs reveal that expanding zones may degrade runtime performance under the existing scheduling policy. This degradation may be attributed to the increase in track length, which increases ion circulation overhead, offsetting the benefits of enhanced parallelism. To mitigate this, the proposed \textit{Plutarch} exploits 3 strategies: (i) unitary decomposition and translation to maximize zone utilization, (ii) prioritizing the execution of nearby gates over ion circulation, and (iii) implementing shortcuts to provide the alternative path.

Abstract: We present SASHMAG (Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy High-field MAGnetometer), an atomic sensor designed for precision magnetic-field measurements in the intermediate-to-high field regime ($>0.2\,\text{T}$) using Rubidium-87 ($^{87}Rb$). The sensor operates in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions decouple, and utilizes counter-propagating pump-probe configuration in Faraday geometry to resolve isolated, Doppler-free Zeeman transitions. To interpret the resulting spectra in this strongly field-dependent regime, we developed a comprehensive multilevel optical Bloch-equation model solved explicitly in the uncoupled $\ket{m_I, m_J}$ basis, capturing state mixing and nonlinear saturation dynamics. This model reproduces measured spectra at sub-Doppler resolution and is consistent with analytical expectations for power broadening and thermal Doppler scaling. Magnetic field estimation is performed using a physics-constrained optimization routine that infers the magnetic field by minimizing the residual between experimentally extracted line centers and calculated transition frequencies from the field-dependent Hamiltonian. We demonstrate magnetic field retrieval from $0.2\,\text{T}$ to $0.4\,\text{T}$ with a precision of $\pm 0.0017 \,\text{T}$). Furthermore, the validated simulation establishes a foundation for generating synthetic training datasets, paving the way for autonomous, Machine Learning-enhanced magnetometry in applications ranging from MRI to fusion reactors.

### [94] [Obfuscation of Arbitrary Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08969)
*Miryam Mi-Ying Huang,Er-Cheng Tang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We present the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits with classical oracles, assuming post-quantum one-way functions. This resolves an open question in prior research. The crux is our novel spsPRU, a unitary fixing a given subspace S and acting randomly on its orthogonal complement. We also implement the solution in the quantum accessible pseudorandom oracle model using existing classical obfuscation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses a long-standing challenge in quantum cryptography by demonstrating that general quantum circuits can be obfuscated in the ideal oracle model, expanding the scope of previously achievable results which were limited to specific types of quantum operations.

Method: We introduce a new primitive called the subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU). Our construction relies on this new unitary, which fixes vectors in a given subspace S and behaves like a random unitary on the orthogonal complement S⊥ under both forward and inverse oracle queries. Additionally, we adapt classical obfuscation techniques for classical circuits to the quantum setting by leveraging the spsPRU to achieve our result in the quantum accessible pseudorandom oracle (QAPOR) model.

Result: Our main result shows that for the first time, we can obfuscate arbitrary quantum circuits in the ideal oracle model under the assumption of post-quantum one-way functions. This capability opens up new possibilities for secure quantum computation and leverages the newly introduced spsPRU as a key building block.

Conclusion: This work is a significant step forward in quantum cryptography. By designing an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits, we have addressed a major theoretical challenge. The central technical innovation is the spsPRU, a powerful new tool that asserts control over a given subspace, while behaving pseudorandomly elsewhere. With this breakthrough, quantum protocols can now achieve functionalities previously believed impossible or tied to restrictive operations like unitary transformations only.

Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to conceal a program's internal structure while preserving its functionality. A central open problem is whether an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits exists. Despite several efforts having been made toward this goal, prior works have succeeded only in obfuscating quantum circuits that implement either pseudo-deterministic functions or unitary transformations. Although unitary transformations already include a broad class of quantum computation, many important quantum tasks, such as state preparation and quantum error-correction, go beyond unitaries and fall within general completely positive trace-preserving maps.
  In this work, we construct the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits that support quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model assuming post-quantum one-way functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed in Bartusek et al. (STOC 2023), Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024), and Huang and Tang (FOCS 2025). At the core of our construction lies a novel primitive that we introduce, called the subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU). An spsPRU is a family of efficient unitaries that fix every vector in a given linear subspace $S$, while acting as a Haar random unitary on the orthogonal complement $S^\perp$ under both forward and inverse oracle queries. Furthermore, by instantiating the classical oracle model with the ideal obfuscation scheme for classical circuits proposed by Jain et al. (CRYPTO 2023) and later enhanced by Bartusek et al.

TL;DR: _observation of a unique magic frequency in a rubidium atom system where light scattering is suppressed due to quantum interference and strong atom-cavity coupling.etection was made through polarization-sensitive measurements of Rayleigh and Raman scattering processes. Two specific magic frequencies were identified: one where both scattering processes are suppressed, and another where only Raman scattering is suppressed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the phenomenon of magic frequencies in a hyperfine atom-cavity system, aiming to understand how quantum interference and collective coupling affect light scattering processes. This research is relevant to the development of cavity QED and quantum information science, where precise control of light-matter interactions is essential.

Method: Cold laser-driven atoms were used to populate the D2 line of ^87Rb. The scattering of light from the atomic cloud into the cavity was measured polarization-sensitively. The Rayleigh and Raman scattering processes were analyzed to identify magic frequencies where scattering is suppressed.

Result: Two magic frequencies were observed: one at 185 MHz below the F=2 ↔ F'=3 transition where both scattering processes are suppressed, and another at -506 MHz where only Raman scattering is suppressed due to single-atom quantum interference.

Conclusion: The discovery of these magic frequencies offers new insights into controlling light scattering in coupled atom-cavity systems, which could have implications for quantum communication and sensing technologies.

Abstract: We report on the observation of a new magic frequency within the hyperfine structure of the D2 line of ${}^{87}$Rb atoms at which the scattering of light into a high-finesse cavity is suppressed by an interplay between quantum interference and the strong collective coupling of atoms to the cavity. Scattering from a cloud of laser-driven cold atoms into the cavity was measured in a polarization sensitive way. We have found that both the Rayleigh and Raman scattering processes into the near-resonant cavity modes are extinguished at 185 MHz below the F=2$\leftrightarrow$F'=3 transition frequency. This coincidence together with the shape of the observed spectral dip imply that the effect relies on a quantum interference in the polariton excitations of the strongly coupled combined atom-photon system. We have also demonstrated the existence of a magic frequency around -506 MHz, where only the Raman scattering is suppressed due to a quantum interference effect at the single-atom level.

Abstract: As qubit decoherence times are increased and readout technologies are improved, nonidealities in the drive signals, such as phase noise, are going to represent a growing limitation to the fidelity achievable at the end of complex control pulse sequencies. Here we study the impact on fidelity of phase noise affecting reference oscillators with the help of numerical simulations, which allow us to directly take into account the interaction between the phase fluctuations in the control signals and the evolution of the qubit state. Our method is based on the generation of phase noise realizations consistent with a given power spectral density, that are then applied to the pulse carrier in simulations, with Qiskit-Dynamics, of the qubit temporal evolution. By comparing the final state obtained at the end of a noisy pulse sequence with that in the ideal case and averaging over multiple noise realizations, we estimate the resulting degradation in fidelity, and exploiting an approximate analytical representation of a carrier affected by phase fluctuations, we discuss the contributions of the different spectral components of phase noise.

Abstract: Exciton-polaritons are light-matter hybrid quasi-particles that have emerged as a flexible platform for developing quantum technologies and engineering material properties. However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants.

Motivation: 他们希望设计一个有效的接收器来提高对BPSK位移压缩真空态的区分能力，特别是在信号能量较小时。这可能在量子通信和量子传感领域有实际应用。

Method: 他们采用了位移操作后进行旋转变换，接着应用压缩操作，并使用光子数分辨器和MAP阈值决策来进行信号检测。

Result: 他们证明了DSR在所有信号能量N下的错误率在[Hellert bound, 2*Hellert bound]区间内。在低能量情况下，DSR在N≈0.3时超越传统S-BPSKSQL，在N≈0.4时低于理想情况下BPSK的最佳性能，并在N≈0.6时的误码率低于1%。此外，他们在非理想情况下，如效率不足、dark counts、相位扩散和接收机的热噪声下进行了性能评估，MAP阈值的自适应能力增强了接收器的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 他们的研究提供了提高S-BPSK区分能力的有效方法，尤其是在非理想条件下的适应性。这对于量子通信系统的性能优化具有重要意义。

Abstract: We propose a displacement-squeeze receiver (DSR) for discriminating BPSK displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK). The receiver applies a displacement followed by a squeezing operation with the squeezing axis rotated by $\fracπ{2}$, and performs photon-number-resolving detection with a MAP threshold decision. This processing effectively increases the distinguishability of the input states by elongating their distance in phase space and reducing their population overlap in Fock basis. We show that for all signal energy N, $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} \in \left[P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}, 2P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}\right]$, under equal priors and ideal condition. In the low-energy regime, DSR beats the S-BPSK SQL at $N \approx 0.3$ and drops below the coherent-state BPSK (C-BPSK) Helstrom bound at $N \approx 0.4$, reaching $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} < 1\%$ near $N \approx 0.6$. Finally, we quantify performance under non-unit efficiency and dark counts, phase diffusion, and receiver thermal noise, with MAP threshold adaptation providing robustness across these nonidealities.

Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, distributed quantum computation has garnered considerable interest, as it overcomes the physical limitations of single-device architectures and enables scalable quantum information processing. In this study, we focus on the challenge of achieving exact amplitude amplification for quantum states with arbitrary amplitude distributions and subsequently propose a Distributed Exact Quantum Amplitude Amplification Algorithm (DEQAAA). Specifically, (1) it supports partitioning across any number of nodes $t$ within the range $2 \leq t \leq n$; (2) the maximum qubit count required for any single node is expressed as $\max \left(n_0,n_1,\dots,n_{t-1} \right) $, where $n_j$ represents the number of qubits at the $j$-th node, with $\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} n_j =n$; (3) it can realize exact amplitude amplification for multiple targets of a quantum state with arbitrary amplitude distributions; (4) we verify the effectiveness of DEQAAA by resolving a specific exact amplitude amplification task involving two targets (8 and 14 in decimal) via MindSpore Quantum, a quantum simulation software, with tests conducted on 4-qubit, 6-qubit, 8-qubit and 10-qubit systems. Notably, through the decomposition of $C^{n-1}PS$ gates, DEQAAA demonstrates remarkable advantages in both quantum gate count and circuit depth as the qubit number scales, thereby boosting its noise resilience. In the 10-qubit scenario, for instance, it achieves a reduction of over $97\%$ in both indicators compared to QAAA and EQAAA, underscoring its outstanding resource-saving performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constructing efficient decoders for concatenated quantum codes is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation

Method: We developed a bidirectional decoding approach that uses higher-level syndrome information to optimize lower-level recovery decisions

Result: The bidirectional decoder enhances the error correction threshold from 1.56% to 4.35% for the concatenated $[[15,7,3]]$ quantum Hamming code under independent bit-flip noise. Additionally, it scales the code distance as 3^{L} while maintaining low logical error suppression compared to standard local decoders that scale as 2^{L+1} with L levels of concatenation

Conclusion: This advancement makes concatenated-code architectures more viable for scalable, low-overhead quantum computation efforts

Abstract: High-rate concatenated quantum codes offer a promising pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet designing efficient decoders that fully exploit their error-correction capability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a hard-decision decoder for concatenated quantum Hamming codes with time complexity polynomial in the block length. This decoder overcomes the limitations of conventional local decoding by leveraging higher-level syndrome information to revise lower-level recovery decisions -- a strategy we refer to as bidirectional decoding. For the concatenated $[[15,7,3]]$ quantum Hamming code under independent bit-flip noise, the bidirectional decoder improves the threshold from approximately $1.56\%$ to $4.35\%$ compared with standard local decoding. Moreover, the decoder empirically preserves the full $3^{L}$ code-distance scaling for at least three levels of concatenation, resulting in substantially faster logical-error suppression than the $2^{L+1}$ scaling offered by local decoders. Our results can enhance the competitiveness of concatenated-code architectures for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了关于QLS基数的已知结果，提供了一个完整的区间范围。

Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $n$ (denoted as QLS$(n)$) is an $n\times n$ array whose entries are unit column vectors from the $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_n$, such that each row and column forms an orthonormal basis. Two unit vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_n$ are regarded as identical if there exists a real number $θ$ such that $|u\rangle=e^{iθ}|v\rangle$; otherwise, they are considered distinct. The cardinality $c$ of a QLS$(n)$ is the number of distinct vectors in the array. In this note,we use sub-QLS$(6)$ to prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$ and any $c\in [6m,36m^2]\setminus \{6m+1\}$, there is a QLS$(6m)$ with cardinality $c$.

Abstract: An initial value algorithm is utilized to examine the time dependent evolution of the electromagnetic fields arising from oblique scattering of bounded pulses from an infinite planar dielectric interface. Since the qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) is almost fully unitary, one finds excellent conservation of electromagnetic energy. Various Gaussian envelope pulses are considered in regimes where the incident angle is below that needed for total internal reflection. While the reflected pulse retains its overall Gaussian shape, the transmitted pulse exhibits a combination of a Gaussian envelope along with Huygen-like emitted wave fronts from the collision point of the initial pulse with the infinite dielectric interface. The strength of these Huygen wavefronts depends on the width of the incident pulse.

Abstract: We develop a unified many-body theory of two-photon dark-state laser cooling, the workhorse for preparing trapped ions close to their motional quantum ground state. For ions with a $Λ$ level structure, driven by Raman lasers, we identify an ion-number-dependent crossover between weak and strong coupling where both the cooling rate and final temperature are simultaneously optimized. We obtain simple analytic results in both extremes: In the weak coupling limit, we show a Lorentzian spin-absorption spectrum determines the cooling rate and final occupation of the motional state, which are both independent of the number of ions. We also highlight the benefit of including an additional spin dependent force in this case. In the strong coupling regime, our theory reveals the role of collective dynamics arising from phonon exchange between dark and bright states, allowing us to explain the enhancement of the cooling rate with increasing ion number. Our analytic results agree closely with exact numerical simulations and provide experimentally accessible guidelines for optimizing cooling in large ion crystals, a key step toward scalable, high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum technologies.

Abstract: Nonlocality is a peculiar nature of quanta and it stands as an important quantum resource in application. Yet mere linear property of it, viz. the first order in moment, has been explored through various inequalities. Noticing the vast higher-order regime unexplored, in this study we investigate the higher-order quantum correlations in entangled hyperon-antihyperon system, which may be generated massively in charmonium decays. A new type of Clauser-Horne inequality for statistical cumulants and central moments is formulated. We find that a significant violation of the third-order constraint, indicating the existence of higher-order correlation, exists in hyperon-antihyperon system and can be observed in high energy physics experiments, like BESIII and Belle II. Notably, the violation manifests more in higher energy systems of the $Λ\barΛ$ pair against the kinematic contamination of timelike events.

Abstract: We propose a geometric hybrid Poincaré sphere (GHPS) as a unified geometrical framework for describing structured photon states with independently controllable spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). Unlike the conventional higher-order Poincaré sphere, in which the SAM and OAM are intrinsically coupled through fixed basis states, the GHPS is constructed by defining its poles as direct products of arbitrary orthogonal bases on the Poincaré sphere (PS) and orbital Poincaré sphere (OPS) and by superposing these pole states. Using numerical simulations, we analyze representative GHPS states and show that the GHPS spherical coordinates govern the amplitude ratio and relative phase between the pole bases. This framework enables spatially inhomogeneous polarization distributions and intensity patterns, including nonseparable structures in which polarization and intensity are intrinsically intertwined, and provides a systematic state-space description for the coherent geometrical control of advanced structured light fields.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The generalized quantum Arimoto--Blahut (QAB) algorithm is a powerful derivative-free iterative method in quantum information theory. A key obstacle to its broader use is that existing convergence guarantees typically rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems. We address this issue by introducing an a posteriori certification viewpoint: instead of requiring fully a priori verifiable assumptions, we provide convergence and error guarantees that can be validated directly from the iterates produced by the algorithm. Specifically, we prove a generalized global convergence theorem showing that, under convexity and a substantially weaker numerically verifiable condition, the QAB iteration converges to the global minimizer. This theorem yields a practical certification procedure: by checking explicit inequalities along the computed trajectory, one can certify global optimality and bound the suboptimality of the obtained value. As an application, we develop a certified iterative scheme for computing the quantum relative entropy of channels, a fundamental measure of distinguishability in quantum dynamics. This quantity is notoriously challenging to evaluate numerically: gradient-based methods are impeded by the complexity of matrix functions such as square roots and logarithms, while recent semidefinite programming approaches can become computationally and memory intensive at high precision. Our method avoids these bottlenecks by combining the QAB iteration with a posteriori certification, yielding an efficient and scalable algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate rapid convergence and improved scalability and adaptivity compared with SDP-based approaches.

Abstract: We study the CHSH inequality from an informational, timing-sensitive viewpoint using game-theoretic probability, which avoids assuming an underlying probability space. The locality loophole and the measurement-dependence (``freedom-of-choice'') loophole are reformulated as structural constraints in a sequential hidden-variable game between Scientists and Nature. We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge. This yields an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations.

Abstract: Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy enables detailed investigations of vibronic effects in molecular and solid-state systems. We present explicit analytical expressions for multidimensional nonlinear response functions in the presence of Herzberg-Teller (non-Condon) coupling, within the displaced harmonic oscillator model. The formulation applies to electronic systems with an arbitrary number N of electronic states and to response functions of arbitrary order M in the light-matter interaction. We show that Herzberg-Teller coupling introduces additional oscillatory factors in the time-domain response functions, leading, upon Fourier transformation, to replicas of the Franck-Condon multidimensional spectra shifted by integer multiples of the vibrational frequencies. The present results provide a general analytical framework for the interpretation of non-Condon effects in coherent multidimensional spectroscopies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of QML protocols is driven by the potential to leverage quantum computing for machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios where classical methods fall short.

Method: The method utilizes the Matrix Product State representation to encode quantum states into circuits with reduced depth, while maintaining classification accuracy and enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks.

Result: The research demonstrates that low-depth approximate encodings using MPS can be implemented, showing that such encodings do not negatively impact classification accuracy and improve resilience to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for more efficient and robust quantum machine learning algorithms that can handle complex data by utilizing Matrix Product State-based encoding methods.

Abstract: One of the key considerations in the development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) protocols is the encoding of classical data onto a quantum device. In this chapter we introduce the Matrix Product State representation of quantum systems and show how it may be used to construct circuits which encode a desired state. Putting this in the context of QML we show how this process may be modified to give a low depth approximate encoding and crucially that this encoding does not hinder classification accuracy and is indeed exhibits an increased robustness against classical adversarial attacks. This is illustrated by demonstrations of adversarially robust variational quantum classifiers for the MNIST and FMNIST dataset, as well as a small-scale experimental demonstration on a superconducting quantum device.

### [111] [Network-Based Quantum Computing: an efficient design framework for many-small-node distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09374)
*Soshun Naito,Yasunari Suzuki,Yuuki Tokunaga*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a network-based approach for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (NBQC) to utilize many small-scale quantum nodes instead of relying on a single large-scale system. The method allows continuous data movement across the network while maintaining connectivity, which the authors claim leads to shorter execution times compared to circuit-based strategies and greater node efficiency than measurement-based quantum computing. Specialization of the network to quantum program characteristics can further reduce the number of nodes required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the challenges of constructing large-scale quantum computers by utilizing distributed systems. Given that large-scale nodes are difficult to build and that most quantum nodes can only store a small number of logical qubits, the proposed NBQC approach aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution.

Method: The authors introduce a network-based architecture for quantum computation, where computational data is continuously moved through the network. Their method ensures connectivity to other nodes while performing computations. They validate their approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating that their method achieves shorter execution times than traditional circuit-based strategies and is more node-efficient than measurement-based quantum computing.

Result: The results of the paper show that the NBQC approach leads to shorter execution times for practical benchmark tasks and is more node-efficient than other methods. Additionally, speciali zing the network to the structure of quantum programs (such as peak access frequencies) can significantly reduce the number of nodes required.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the proposed network-based quantum computation (NBQC) approach provides a foundation for designing distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures that utilize the redundancy of many small-scale nodes. This method not only achieves shorter execution times but also allows for network node reduction by specializing it to the structure of quantum programs.

Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, a large number of physical qubits are required to construct a single logical qubit, and a single quantum node may be able to hold only a small number of logical qubits. In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes.

### [112] [Sparse quantum state preparation with improved Toffoli cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09388)
*Felix Rupprecht,Sabine Wölk*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimized quantum circuit for preparing sparse quantum states, which are essential in quantum algorithms like quantum simulations and linear system solvers. By leveraging a combination of techniques to improve the cost-efficiency of the circuit, specifically focusing on reducing Toffoli gate usage, the authors claim a significant reduction in quantum computational resources compared to prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to optimize quantum computing resources, particularly in handling sparse states which are common in various quantum algorithms. Efficient preparation of these states can lead to enhanced performance in quantum simulations and linear system solving.

Method: The authors propose a two-step method: first, they prepare a dense state on a reduced qubit register of logarithmic size relative to the sparsity of the target state. Second, they map this dense state to the target sparse state using an optimized isometry. The improvement comes from an efficient algorithm for implementing this isometry, which aims to minimize the number of required Toffoli gates.

Result: The key result is the reduction of the worst-case Toffoli gate count by approximately half compared to previous methods. This is achieved by designing a more efficient isometry circuit, which reduces the operation's gate count from linear to logarithmic in terms of the sparsity parameter.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant advancement in the efficient preparation of sparse quantum states, offering a practical approach to reduce the quantum computational complexity in various applications. The optimized circuit design opens new possibilities for more efficient and scalable quantum algorithms.

Abstract: The preparation of quantum states is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum computing, and a key primitive in many quantum algorithms. Of particular interest to areas such as quantum simulation and linear-system solvers are sparse quantum states, which contain only a small number $s$ of non-zero computational basis states compared to a generic state. In this work, we present an approach that prepares $s$-sparse states on $n$ qubits, reducing the number of Toffoli gates required compared to prior art. We work in the established framework of first preparing a dense state on a $\lceil{\log(s)}\rceil$-qubit sub-register, and then mapping this state to the target state via an isometry, with the latter step dominating the cost of the full algorithm. The speed-up is achieved by designing an efficient algorithm for finding and implementing the isometry. The worst-case Toffoli cost of our isometry circuit, which may be viewed as a batched version of an approach by Malvetti et al., is essentially $2s$ for sufficiently large values of $n$, yielding roughly a $\log(s)/2$ improvement factor over the state-of-the-art. In numerical benchmarks on randomly chosen states, the cost is closer to $s$. With the improved isometry circuit, we examine the dense-state preparation step and present ways to optimize the joint cost of both steps, particularly in the case of target states with purely real coefficients, by outsourcing some sub-tasks from the dense-state preparation to the isometry.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model is studied in this work, with the explicit $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term incorporated as required by the Thomas-Reich-Kuhn sum rule. It is shown that anisotropy provides a generic and robust mechanism for overcoming the no-go theorem in dissipative quantum systems, thereby establishing a genuine platform for observing dissipative phase transitions. The inclusion of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term yields a significantly richer and asymmetric steady-state phase diagram, consisting of normal, superradiant, and bistable phases that intersect at tricritical points, while isolated bistable phases also emerge and the number of tricritical points is reduced. Notably, it is near the intersection of the two critical-line branches enclosing the superradiant phases, rather than at the tricritical points, that the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term fundamentally alters the scaling of photon-number fluctuations. Given the inherent role of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term in light-matter interactions, our findings open a realistic route toward the experimental investigation and dynamical control of nonequilibrium critical phenomena in practical open quantum platforms.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian mechanical states are a key resource for quantum-enhanced sensing and tests of macroscopic quantum physics. We propose a measurement-based protocol to herald delocalized, nonclassical states of a mechanical oscillator in cavity optomechanics by conditioning on Geiger photodetection of the optical output. We analyse under which conditions Stokes-induced optomechanical entanglement give rise to mechanical Wigner Function negativity upon detection. We develop and compare a blue-detuned pulsed scheme and a continuous-wave steady-state scheme employing temporal-mode filtering, and we quantify heralding rates and robustness to finite temperature under realistic detection efficiencies.

Abstract: We investigated the spectral properties of squeezed light generated via parametric down-conversion in the high-gain regime, considering both unapodized and apodized dispersion-engineered waveguides. The gain-dependent evolution of these states is examined starting from the low-gain regime, which includes both highly correlated and nearly uncorrelated cases. For the unapodized configuration, we observe a monotonic increase in spectral purity with gain, whereas the apodized configuration exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, initially decreasing and then recovering at higher gain. By combining Schmidt-mode analysis with a group-velocity-based interpretation, we explain why different dispersion conditions exhibit distinct gain-dependent behavior, specifically that rapid purification occurs when the pump group velocity lies between those of the signal and idler. Our study shows that the evolution of spectral purity is governed primarily by the underlying dispersion of the waveguide. These results demonstrate that dispersion engineering and parametric gain can be jointly exploited to tailor the spectral-mode structure of squeezed-light sources, enabling their optimization for a broad range of quantum applications.

Abstract: We present an analytically tractable theory of reservoir-engineered refrigeration of a superconducting microwave cavity and map it onto a realistic solid-state implementation based on gate-defined double-quantum-dot (DQD) spin qubits. Treating the DQD not as a spectroscopic element but as a tunable engineered reservoir, we show how gate control of populations, coherences, linewidths, and detuning defines an effective photon birth-death process with predictable detailed balance. This framework yields closed-form expressions for the cavity steady state, identifies cooling bounds and detuning-dependent refrigeration valleys, and clarifies when refrigeration can drive the cavity below both the bath temperature and the DQD setpoint. By distinguishing refreshed (collision-like) and persistent reservoir regimes, we show how memory effects, saturation, and dark-state formation constrain cooling in realistic devices, while collective bright-mode coupling in a two-dot configuration can enhance refrigeration subject to mismatch and dephasing, as confirmed by numerical Lindblad simulations demonstrating targeted millikelvin cavity cooling relevant for cryogenic circuit-QED architectures.

TL;DR: This book presents a geometry-first, hardware-aware approach to quantum-information workflows, aiming to connect quantum states, circuits, and measurement with deterministic classical pipelines for hybrid quantum systems. It covers linear algebra, Bloch-sphere viewpoint, differential geometry, quantum Fisher information, quantum circuits as dataflow graphs, multi-qubit structures, topological error correction, and quantum cryptography.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to bridge the gap between quantum theory and classical computing, enabling efficient and deterministic operation of hybrid quantum systems for practical applications.

Method: The book employs a structured approach, dividing into four parts. Part 1 develops the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, focusing on geometry and measurement. Part 2 introduces quantum circuits as dataflow graphs for asynchronous processing. Part 3 explores quantum algorithms and entanglement through geometric frameworks, including Shor's algorithm. Part 4 addresses error correction and real-time decoding challenges, integrating topological codes and hardware constraints. The optional section on quantum cryptography adds advanced topics for enhanced security.

Result: The comprehensive framework provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing quantum-classical hybrid systems, addressing key challenges in quantum computing, error correction, and cryptography. It offers a foundation for advancing quantum technologies with rigorous mathematical underpinnings, modular design, and practical real-world applications.

Conclusion: By integrating geometry, hardware awareness, and asynchronous processing, this book offers a transformative approach to quantum computing, enhancing scalability and reliability for future quantum systems.

Abstract: This book gives a geometry-first, hardware-aware route through quantum-information workflows, with one goal: connect states, circuits, and measurement to deterministic classical pipelines that make hybrid quantum systems run. Part 1 develops the backbone (essential linear algebra, the Bloch-sphere viewpoint, differential-geometric intuition, and quantum Fisher information geometry) so evolution can be read as motion on curved spaces and measurement as statistics. Part 2 reframes circuits as dataflow graphs: measurement outcomes are parsed, aggregated, and reduced to small linear-algebra updates that schedule the next pulses, highlighting why low-latency, low-jitter streaming matters. Part 3 treats multi-qubit structure and entanglement as geometry and computation, including teleportation, superdense coding, entanglement detection, and Shor's algorithm via quantum phase estimation. Part 4 focuses on topological error correction and real-time decoding (Track A): stabilizer codes, surface-code decoding as "topology -> graph -> algorithm", and Union-Find decoders down to microarchitectural/RTL constraints, with verification, fault injection, and host/control-stack integration under product metrics (bounded latency, p99 tails, fail-closed policies, observability). Optional Track C covers quantum cryptography and streaming post-processing (BB84/E91, QBER/abort rules, privacy amplification, and zero-knowledge/post-quantum themes), emphasizing FSMs, counters, and hash pipelines. Appendices provide visualization-driven iCEstick labs (switch-to-bit conditioning, fixed-point phase arithmetic, FSM sequencing, minimal control ISAs), bridging principles to implementable systems.

Conclusion: GMRE为多态纠缠提供了有用的量度，为量子纠缠问题提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce the genuine multipartite Rains entanglement (GMRE) as a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that can be computed using semi-definite programming. Similar to the Rains relative entropy (its bipartite counterpart), the GMRE is monotone under selective quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, implying that it is a multipartite entanglement monotone. As a consequence, we show that the GMRE bounds both the one-shot standard and probabilistic approximate GHZ-distillable entanglement from above. We also develop a generalization of this quantity that incorporates other entropies, including quantum Renyi relative entropies.

Abstract: Highly multipartite entangled states play an important role in various quantum computing tasks. We investigate the dissipative generation of a complex entanglement structure as in a cluster state through engineered Markovian dynamics in the spin systems coupled via Ising interactions. Using the Lindblad master equation, we design a projection based dissipative channel that drives the system toward a unique pure steady state corresponding to the desired cluster state. This is done by removing the contribution of the orthogonal states. By explicitly constructing the Liouvillian superoperator in the full $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, we compute the steady-state density matrix, the Liouvillian spectral gap, entanglement witness and the fidelity with respect to the ideal cluster state. The results demonstrate that the cluster state emerges as the steady state when the engineered Liouvillian dissipation dominates over the local Ising interaction between spins. Moreover, we find that the fidelity and Liouvillian spectral gap is relatively insensitive to the system size once the saturation dissipation has been achieved that scales linearly with the qubit number. This analysis illustrates a physically realizable path towards steady-state entanglement generation in the spin systems using engineered dissipation.

Abstract: Molecular spins are promising candidates for quantum information science, leveraging coherent electronic spin states for quantum sensing and computation. However, the practical application of these systems is hindered by electronic spin decoherence, driven by interactions with nuclear spins in the molecule and the surrounding environment at low temperatures. Predicting dephasing dynamics remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the spin bath. In this work, we develop a non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation to treat an electronic spin coupled to a nuclear-spin bath. By relating ab initio electronic structure parameters directly to the decoherence dynamics, we provide a framework that accounts for pure dephasing in the low-temperature limit. We apply this method to a series of molecular qubit candidates and demonstrate good agreement with experimental relaxation trends. This approach offers a computationally efficient path for the prediction of low-temperature decoherence trends in molecular spin systems.

Abstract: The generation of non-Gaussian quantum states is a key requirement for universal continuous-variable quantum information processing. We report the experimental generation of large-amplitude squeezed coherent-state superpositions (squeezed cat states) on free-space optical pulses, reaching an amplitude of $α= 2.47$, which, to our knowledge, exceeds all previously reported values. Our protocol relies on the controlled mixing of the Fock states $|1\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$ through a tunable beam splitter, followed by heralding via homodyne detection. The resulting state displays three well-resolved negative regions in its Wigner function and achieves a fidelity of $0.53$ with the target state $\propto \hat{S}(z)(|α\rangle - |-α\rangle)$, with $α= 2.47$ and squeezing parameter $z = 0.56$. These results constitute a significant milestone for temporal breeding protocols and for the iterative generation of optical GKP states, opening new perspectives for scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum architectures.

Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.
  The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We show that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also show that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel, answering a question of Daws.
