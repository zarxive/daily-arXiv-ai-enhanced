This method is\nemployed to numerically solve the ordinary differential equation emerging from\nthe linearization of the associated nonlinear differential equation. In the\nfirst algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018),\nwhile in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs\net al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient\nconditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is\nindispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an\nefficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.\n  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of\nO(d$\\cdot$log(d)+T$\\cdot$polylog(T/$\\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the\nCarleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\\varepsilon$ is the\napproximation error. The second algorithm is polynomial in $log(d)$, $T$, and\n$log(1/\\varepsilon)$ - the gate complexity scales as\nO(polylog(d)$\\cdot$T$\\cdot$polylog(T/$\\varepsilon$)). In terms of $T$ and\n$\\varepsilon$, this is comparable to the speedup gained by the current best\nknown quantum algorithm for this problem, the truncated Taylor series method\n(Costa et.al., 2025).\n  Our approach has two shortcomings. First, we have not provided an upper\nbound, in terms of d, on the condition number of the Carleman matrix. Second,\nthe success of the diagonalization is based on a conjecture that a specific\ntrigonometric equation has no integral solution. However, we provide strategies\nto mitigate these shortcomings in most practical cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Beyond first-order equivalence, we show Fresnel's\ndispersive term encodes group velocity (energy transport) versus phase velocity\n(wave-crest motion)-a distinction mechanical models naturally capture but pure\nkinematic velocity addition cannot address. The rigidity-based interpretation\nof dispersion, established in acoustic metamaterials, provides cross-domain\ninsights for materials design and suggests testable predictions linking\nacoustic compliance to optical drag. This three-way equivalence reduces\nindependent phenomena to a single principle: waves riding compliant inclusions.\nFresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization all emerge as\naspects of this one mechanism, traced through the historical\ndensity-versus-rigidity fork that shaped aether theory's trajectory. The\ncompliant-inclusion principle shows striking quantitative agreement with\nisotope mass-dependence and resonance structure in existing spectroscopic data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

One requirement to create a quantum processor is\nnonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by\nsandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a\nJosephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that\nhinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum\nnecessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead\nto dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for\nhigh-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations\nusing a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator\ntransition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit\nits thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link\nemploying only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching.

Through a thin-deflector analysis of an\nelectrostatic homogeneous-field deflector, the extreme sensitivity of current\nmonochromators to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections is\ndemonstrated. These stringent alignment requirements for achieving optimal\nenergy resolution often necessitate the use of additional correcting elements,\nadding to both cost and complexity. We demonstrate that the fringe-field\ndeflector is instead less sensitive to these issues. Hence, a cost effective\nand simple monochromator design approach based on pure fringe fields is\nproposed. This monochromator does not need extra correcting elements and its\noptimal energy resolution is achieved by including momentary deceleration\nlenses surrounding the main deflector.

In these systems, the first- and second-order\nanomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of\nthe Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a\nsymmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole\nby coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry\nconnection polarizability.

At weak coupling, the amplitude saturates bootstrap bounds, indicating maximal predictability. At strong coupling, it nearly saturates these bounds, suggesting saturation at infinite coupling. Intermediate coupling exhibits a nontrivial trajectory in the space of observables.

The findings serve as a bridge between weak and strong coupling analyses, leveraging integrability, bootstrap methods, and Pad\u00e9 approximations to construct a finite-coupling model. The discovered properties, such as complete monotonicity, underscore the robustness of the scattering amplitude's structure across varying coupling strengths."}}

While\nthe EMCD technique offers unmatched spatial resolution, its quantitative\naccuracy remains under scrutiny, particularly in beam-splitter geometries with\nconvergent probes. Here, we systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative\nEMCD analysis using the first-order magnetostructural transition in the\nfunctional phase-change material FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference. Unlike\nprevious EMCD studies primarily focused on elemental ferromagnets such as Fe,\nwe demonstrate its applicability to a correlated material exhibiting coupled\nstructural and magnetic order. We demonstrate that the extracted\norbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\\text{L}/m_\\text{S}$) remains consistent with\nXMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing\nthe validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher\nconvergence angles, we observe an enhanced $m_\\text{L}/m_\\text{S}$, which we\nattribute to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale\nheterogeneity within the probed volume. Our results confirm that EMCD provides\nquantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions,\nwhile uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic\nmoments in functional magnetic materials, and allowing the study of\ninterfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible\nto photon-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7FeRh\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u78c1\u5706 dichroism (EMCD)\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06EMCD\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5982\u94c1\u94d1\u5408\u91d1\u3002EMCD\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u5728\u5149\u6805\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u53d1\u6563\u63a2\u9488\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57286\u7eb3\u7c73\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0cEMCD\u7684\u91cf\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u4e0eXMCD\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u78c1\u6027\u7279\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u78c1\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002EMCD\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u7d20\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5177\u6709 unparalleled \u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5149\u6805\u548c\u53d1\u6563\u63a2\u9488\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3EMCD\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7FeRh\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u78c1\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u78c1\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86EMCD\u5206\u6790\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u7684\u6781\u9650\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8986\u76d6\u4ece6\u7eb3\u7c73\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387TEM\u4fb5\u5165\u6837\u672c\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u50cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eXMCD\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86EMCD\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57286\u7eb3\u7c73\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0cEMCD\u7684\u91cf\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u4e0eXMCD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u5185EMCD\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ece6\u7eb3\u7c73\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u91cf\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u6536\u655b\u89d2\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002EMCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u78c1\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86EMCD\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u78c1\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002EMCD\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5e7f\u57df\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4e0eXMCD\u91cf\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u754c\u9762\u3001\u7f3a\u9677\u6216\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u78c1\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

For that task, two common\ncircuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state\npreparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices\nin the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine\nmethods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical\nform, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations.\nTwo key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for\nefficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in\nclassical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b)\nlow-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and\nstate preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially\nequivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our\nconstructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously\nmultiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an\nalgorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in\nthe standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli\nmatrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is based on the postulations\nthat quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints,\nrepresent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift\ngenerate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses\ntoward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the\nscale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,\nvector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of\ntime for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,\nthe tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra\nmodes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the\nconstraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over\nall length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave\nvector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations\nwith large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range\ninteractions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them\nundetectable without sufficient temporal resolution.

We show the power of the\nformalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes.\nNamely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black\nholes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius.

We establish the gauge-invariant nonlinear stability of such fields,\nnamely the existence of a globally hyperbolic development, which remains\nasymptotic to Minkowski spacetime in future timelike, null, and spacelike\ndirections. Previous results on this problem have been limited to the\nEinstein-Dirac system in the massless case. Our analysis follows the\nasymptotically hyperboloidal-Euclidean framework introduced by LeFloch and Y.\nMa for the massive Klein-Gordon-Einstein system. The structure specific to\nspinor fields and the Dirac equation necessitates significantly new elements in\nthe proof. In contrast with prior approaches, our treatment of spinor fields\nand the Dirac equation is gauge-invariant, relying on the formalism of Lorentz\nClifford algebras, principal fiber bundles, etc. Our analysis is carried out\nwith the metric expressed in light-bending wave coordinates, as we call them.\nThis leads us to the study of a global existence problem for a system of wave\nequations with constraints and a Klein-Gordon-type equations. We derive L2\nestimates for the Dirac equation and its coupling with the Einstein equations,\nalong with $pointwise estimates. New Sobolev inequalities are proven for spinor\nfields in a gauge-invariant manner in the hyperboloidal-Euclidean foliation.\nThe nonlinear coupling between the massive Dirac equation and the Einstein\nequations is investigated, and we establish a hierarchy of estimates, which\ndistinguish between translations, rotations, and boosts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The\npullback of the gauge field to the horizon is allowed to diverge while its\nfield strength remains smooth, yielding gauge-invariant electric\npotential-charge pairs in the first law.

This revolutionary technology could transform modern\nradar. However, it is widely believed that the decoherence induced by the\nubiquitous quantum noise destroys the superiority of quantum illumination,\nseverely constraining its performance and application in our present noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we propose a method to restore the\nquantum superiority of the quantum illumination in the presence of quantum\nnoises. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov approximation, we discover\nthat the resolution of noisy quantum illumination is highly sensitive to the\nenergy spectrum of the composite system formed by each of the two light modes\nand its local quantum noise. When a bound state is present in the energy\nspectrum, the resolution asymptotically approaches its ideal form.

However, is there\nany justification for avoiding time slices that cover inside the event horizon?\nTo answer the question, we investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, where the\ntime slices can cover both inside and outside the event horizon. We find that\none can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave\nfunction must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly\nsuggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface\nthat crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must\nkeep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the\nevent horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single\ncoherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a\nsuperposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a\nhorizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum\nmacroscopic object.

In this work, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of a\ntrapped ion where the Rabi frequency (Omega) approaches the vibrational mode\nfrequency (nu), pushing the system beyond the weak-field regime, where\nnon-trivial quantum correlations emerge. We begin by setting the detuning\n(delta) - the frequency offset between the qubit transition and the driving\nfield - to zero and varying Omega from low to high values, eventually reaching\nthe vibrational frequency. Using quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the\ndensity matrix and track its evolution to assess non-Markovianity, revealing\nsignificant memory effects governed by the interplay between internal and\nmotional degrees of freedom. Furthermore, by exploring the dynamics across\nvarious parameter pairs (Omega, delta), we find that non-Markovianity does not\nalways increase monotonically with Omega for a fixed delta.

Based on the recent work (PRB {\\bf 111}, 024501 (2025)) on\nthe detection sensitive limit of the usual equilibrium JTD, here we numerically\ndemonstrate that a non-equilibrium JTD can be alternatively utilized to\nimplement the higher sensitive detection of a weak microwave signal, arriving\nat its energy quantum limit. In the presence of thermal noise, we numerically\nsimulate the phase dynamics for the CBJJ in the JTD with the different sweep\nrates of the biased currents, and find that the SCDs of the JTD with and\nwithout the microwave signal input show different behaviors. It is demonstrated\nthat, depending on how high the sweep rate of the biased current being applied,\nthe JTD can be operated in either the equilibrium- or the non-equilibrium\nstate.

We also show that\nwhile typicality of contextuality decreases as the purity (sharpness) of the\npreparations (measurements) decreases, this dependence is not especially\npronounced, so contextuality is fairly typical even in settings with realistic\nnoise. Finally, we show that although nonzero contextuality is quite typical,\nquantitatively high degrees of contextuality are not as typical, and so large\nquantum advantages (like for parity-oblivious multiplexing, which we take as a\ncase study) are not as typical. We provide an open-source toolbox that outputs\nthe typicality of contextuality as a function of tunable parameters (such as\nlower and upper bounds on purity and other constraints on states and\nmeasurements). This toolbox can inform the design of experiments that achieve\nthe desired typicality of contextuality for specified experimental constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u76f8\u5f53\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u51c6\u5907\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d85\u8fc799%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6458\u8981\u8fd8\u63d0\u5230\u968f\u7740\u7eaf\u5ea6\uff08\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u964d\u4f4e\u5e76\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u4ecd\u7136\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6458\u8981\u6307\u51fa\u5c3d\u7ba1\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5927\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u5982\u4e0e\u5178\u578b\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u6458\u8981\u8fd8\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7eaf\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u9650\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6240\u9700\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u5178\u578b\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u76f8\u5f53\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7eaf\u5ea6\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u76f8\u5f53\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u968f\u673a\u51c6\u5907\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d85\u8fc799%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7eaf\u5ea6\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u4ecd\u7136\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5927\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u5178\u578b\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u7eaf\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

It builds on the Subset-Sum\nLinear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis\nstrings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)\nequalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented\nwithin TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that\nsupports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow\nreasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,\nedit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.\nWithin this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates\nthe problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics\ninto rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and\nthe induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with\nnondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\\in\\{2,3,4\\}$ and $n\\le6$ qubits,\nsystematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic\nlogical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$\nat $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring\nstructures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities\nfor all parameters.

When both $k$ and the dimension of the\nstates are part of the input, we prove that there exist succinct certificates\nplacing the problem in NP, and we establish NP-hardness by a reduction from the\nclassical $k$-clique problem.
