Such\nfs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light\nthat are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while\nsimultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high\npeak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique\ntools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time\nrequired to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling,\nfrom the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse\nenergy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via\ndiffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence,\nthe fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or\nablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred\nnanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable\nnonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation\nand relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the\nreasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials\nprocessing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids.\nWe identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision\nor the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or\nprocessing rates.

One of the species is subjected to\nRaman assisted tunneling, which leads to a synthetic flux within the framework\nof synthetic dimensions. In the deep Mott regime, the low energy physics is\ngoverned by an unconventional and highly tunable spin model, which is\ncharacterized by two distinct spin chains. The synthetic flux serves as an\neffective spin-orbit coupling, inducing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in\none of the spin chains. The inter-species spin exchange interaction gives rise\nto the inter-chain coupling embodied as an isotropic XX interaction. Using\ntime-evolving block decimation method for tensor network states, we compute\norder parameters, correlation functions and structure factors to identify the\nground state magnetic phases. The DM interaction in one species, when combined\nwith the inter-species spin-exchange interaction, can induce spiral magnetic\norder in the second, otherwise non-chiral species. Besides, the interplay of a\ntransverse field applied to one spin chain and the inter-species coupling can\ndrive both spin chains into a paramagnetic phase simultaneously.

In this study, we investigate the influence of atomic\nsubstitution on core-hole relaxation dynamics and molecular fragmentation in\nBr2 and IBr, initiated by x-ray absorption at the Br K-edge. Using a\ncombination of X-ray/ion coincidence measurements and Monte Carlo/molecular\ndynamics simulations, we track charge distribution and the kinetic energy\nrelease (KER) of fragment ions with a total charge from 2+ to 8+.

Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange\nmultipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum\ndynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction.\nWe demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system\nwith vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the\ntime-independent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac\nquantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global\ntranslational invariance, where all three methods agree.

In addition to a\nunified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism\nalso offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising\nfrom vacuum fluctuations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f enforcement\uff0c\u4ee5\u771f\u7a7a\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u9879\u6269\u5c55\u5e73\u7a33\u4f5c\u7528\u539f\u7406\u3002\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u52a0\u5728\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51ed\u501f\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7ebf\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u4ece\u771f\u7a7a\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea6\u675f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u4e0a\u6709\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f enforcement\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e73\u7a33\u4f5c\u7528\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9879\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5e73\u7a33\u4f5c\u7528\u539f\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e58\u6570\u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u52a0\u5728\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9879\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ca1\u6709\u5148\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5148\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u5c55\u793a\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7ea6\u51cf\u548c\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u859b\u5b9a\u9537\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u8be5\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e2d\u53ea\u5f97\u5230\u5e73\u51e1\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u663e\u793a\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f enforcement\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u4f5c\u7528\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9879\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u7ebf\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u7a7a\u6ce2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In fact, later studies\nrealized that the graviton mass is not an accident and it is necessary for the\nconsistency of the holographic interpretation for entanglement islands. An\nimportant lesson we learned from these studies is that the graviton mass is a\nmanifestation of the deep relationship between quantum entanglement and\nemergent geometry (EPR=ER). Nevertheless, various interesting questions and\ncounter-arguments exist regarding whether this connection is of any relevance,\neither by modifying the definition of entanglement islands or denying the\ngraviton mass as a physically relevant concept. In this paper, we will revisit\nthe necessity of graviton mass for the consistency of entanglement islands and\naddress the above questions in and out of the literature. Since the\ncalculations in higher dimensions are already well understood, we will start\nwith a demonstration of massive islands in a frequently used lower dimensional\nmodel, AdS$_{2}$ Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled with transparent\nconformal matter fields, for which the relationship between energy dissipation\nand the graviton mass manifests. We will then discuss the necessity of graviton\nmass for entanglement islands in general situations and clarify the physical\nmeaning of graviton mass. In the end, we will comment on the attempts to\nconstruct entanglement islands in massless gravity and suggest the search for a\nnew type of entanglement wedges in holography.\n  The purpose of this paper is to summarize the recent progress, clarifying\npotential confusions and convey key messages to both experts and non-experts in\nthe field.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Crucially,\nwe find that the associated topological winding number is preserved under\ndiverse perturbations, ensuring stable information encoding and retrieval. This\nparadigm illustrates how structured light can simultaneously expand channel\ndimensionality and maintain robustness, charting a pathway to chip-scale,\nreconfigurable photonic platforms for the PHz era, while also opening\npreviously inaccessible regimes of light-matter interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, the combustion behaviour of silicon particles is\nexamined using an electrostatic levitator with laser ignition. Five oxidizing\nenvironments at atmospheric pressure are investigated: air, pure oxygen, and\nmixtures containing 40% oxygen (by mole) diluted with nitrogen, helium, or\nargon. The burning droplet peak temperature, measured by three-colour\npyrometry, increases by 337 K from air to pure oxygen. The peak temperature of\nthe silicon droplet in the 40%O2-60%He mixture is lower than that in the\n40%O2-60%Ar mixture, in contradiction with thermodynamic predictions, due to a\nhigher Lewis number of the helium-diluted mixture. Although oxygen diffusivity\nis higher in the helium-diluted mixture, a lower burning rate is observed,\nattributed to the lower combustion temperature. High-speed colour camera\nobservations reveal that the square of the particle diameter decreases with\ntime in each combustion run, following a strong linear relationship (R2 > 0.99)\nacross all oxidizing environments. However, the combustion lifetime is\nproportional to the initial particle diameter to the power of n, with n ranging\nfrom 1.69 to 1.82. This deviation from the expected n = 2 appears to result\nfrom unavoidable measurement uncertainties and the limited particle size range,\nrather than differences in combustion physics.

Our platform achieves record-high measured Q-factors up to 3000\nin the mid-IR spectrum, supporting efficient dynamic modulation through two\ndistinct schemes: (i) on-chip electro-thermal tuning via Joule heating,\nsustaining 50% modulation depth at CMOS-compatible voltages and speeds up to\n14.5 kHz, and (ii) ultrafast all-optical modulation via carrier generation in\nsilicon, reaching nanosecond response times and estimated sub-GHz modulation\nrates. By uniting sharp resonances, strong contrast, large-scale\nmanufacturability, and dynamic tunability, our active silicon membrane\nmetasurfaces advance the frontier of mid-IR nanophotonics and open new\nopportunities in sensing, free-space communication, thermal radiation\nmanagement, and quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discusses the development of actively tunable single-crystalline silicon membrane metasurfaces for mid-IR nanophotonics, addressing challenges such as low-Q resonances, weak amplitude contrast, and static nature through advanced materials and methods.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this research is to overcome the limitations of metasurfaces in mid-IR applications, particularly due to material constraints and substrate absorption.", "method": "The method involves creating high-Q resonances with high-contrast using single-crystalline silicon membranes, combined with electro-thermal and ultrafast all-optical tuning mechanisms.", "result": "The metasurfaces achieve record-high Q-factors of up to 3000, 50% modulation depth at low voltages, and nanosecond response times for dynamic applications.", "conclusion": "These advancements open new possibilities in mid-IR sensing, communication, thermal management, and quantum technologies."}}

Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the\nenergy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory\nmethods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the\nfiber level, which can be visualized using $\\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present\na laboratory $\\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its\ncapability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets.

Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$\nand the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist\nonly if $q_M = 0$.

The\nacceleration factor $A$ suppresses the radial effective potential\n$V_{\\text{eff}}$, thereby lowering the energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$\nrequired for stable circular orbits. Stability demands $\\partial_r^2\nV_{\\text{eff}} \\geq 0$, setting an upper bound $AM$ $\\leq 0.0161$. As $A$\nincreases, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius grows, while\n$L_{\\text{ISCO}}$ and $E_{\\text{ISCO}}$ decrease. Radiative efficiency\n$\\epsilon$ rises with $A$, peaking at $6.9\\%$. Fundamental frequencies show\nthat $A$ accelerates the decay of the Keplerian $\\Omega_{\\phi}$ and vertical\n$\\Omega_{\\theta}$ frequencies, while suppressing the radial frequency. The\ndivergence between $\\Omega_{\\theta}$ and $\\Omega_{\\phi}$ increases with $A$,\ndiffering from spherical black hole behavior. Using the RP, ER3, ER4, and WD\nQPO models, the WD model predicts the highest frequencies. The resonant radius\nof ER4 model remains fixed across frequency ratios, unlike ER3. Although $A$\nsuppresses twin-peak QPO frequencies, it enhances the nodal precession\nfrequency $\\nu_{\\text{nod}}$.

We also find that the\ndynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting\ncoherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum\nbatteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted\nfrom quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and\nlocal reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains\nindependent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits\na clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting\ndistinct operational behaviors under different noise models.

While the\nemergence of such instability is attributed to the non-Hermitian nature of the\ngravitational system, it remains sensitive to various factors. About the\nspatial scale of the metric deformation, spectral instability is particularly\nsusceptible to ``ultraviolet'' metric perturbations. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of black hole spectral instability triggered by random\nand deterministic metric perturbations. We investigate the dependence on the\nmagnitude, spatial scale, and localization of the metric perturbations in the\nP\\\"oschl-Teller effective potential, and discuss the underlying physical\ninterpretations. It is observed that small metric perturbations initially have\na limited impact on the less damped black hole quasinormal modes, and\ndeviations typically around their unperturbed values, a phenomenon first\nderived by Skakala and Visser in a more restrictive context. In the higher\novertone region, the deformation propagates, amplifies, and eventually gives\nrise to spectral instability and, inclusively, bifurcation in the quasinormal\nmode spectrum. While deterministic metric perturbations give rise to a deformed\nbut well-defined quasinormal spectrum, random perturbations lead to\nuncertainties in the resulting spectrum. Nonetheless, the primary trend of the\nspectral instability remains consistent, being sensitive to both the strength\nand location of the perturbation. However, we demonstrate that the observed\nspectral instability might be suppressed for metric perturbations that are\nphysically appropriate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u970d\u91d1\u8f90\u5c04\u8c31\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u53d7\u5230\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8c31\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u5408\u9002\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c31\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u970d\u91d1\u8f90\u5c04\u8c31\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u89e3\u6790\u8c31\u90bb\u57df\u52bf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df", "result": "\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u5408\u9002\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u8c31\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u970d\u91d1\u8f90\u5c04\u8c31\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u3002"}}

It may\ntherefore be possible to maintain local causality by rejecting one of these\nother assumptions instead. One possibility that has recently received\nsignificant attention involves rejecting the principle of statistical\nindependence (SI). In this paper, we consider the frequency interpretation of\nSI, which states that $\\rho(\\lambda) \\approx \\rho(\\lambda | Z)$, where\n$\\rho(\\lambda)$ is the relative frequency of an element of an ensemble being in\nthe state $\\lambda$, and $Z$ is a label that separates the ensemble into\napparently randomly selected sub-ensembles. SI is violated when the\nsub-ensemble frequency $\\rho(\\lambda | Z)$ fails to be representative of the\nensemble frequency $\\rho(\\lambda)$. We argue that physical theories that\nsystematically violate SI should all be understood as superdeterministic. This\nperspective on SI sheds light on a number of issues that are being debated in\nthe superdeterminism literature, especially concerning its scope and\nphilosophical consequences. Regarding scope, we argue that superdeterministic\ntheories fall into three categories, deterministic theories with fine-tuned\ninitial conditions, fluke theories, and nomic exclusion theories. We also argue\nthat retrocausal and invariant set theories need not violate SI, which is\ncontrary to how they are normally presented. Regarding philosophical\nimplications, we argue that superdeterminism is incompatible with free will\naccording to some prominent compatibilist accounts. We also argue that although\nsuperdeterminism is conspiratorial, it is not unscientific, but pre-scientific.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To mitigate\nthese effects, we apply local operations on the system of interest prior to the\nglobal evolution. This ensures that a specific dynamics-matching condition is\nsatisfied - namely, that the system's dynamics can be U-generated starting from\nan initial product state. We review two strategies for achieving this: local\nmeasurements and local unitaries. For each, we outline their respective\nadvantages and disadvantages and provide examples illustrating when the\ndynamics-matching condition can be satisfied. Since most operations inevitably\nalter the system's initial state, we optimize the fidelity between the original\nsystem state and the post-operation state, ensuring the condition can be met\nwith minimal perturbation. Local measurements always guarantee that the system\ndynamics can be U-generated from a product state, but this comes at the cost of\nreduced fidelity. By contrast, local unitary transformations typically avoid\nthis loss of fidelity: in our numerical study of 402 cases, they succeeded in\nnearly all instances, with a minimum fidelity of about 94.2%. We further\nstrengthen these results by showing that a single unitary operation can prevent\nall non-completely positive quantum dynamics for a system and environment\nundergoing time-dependent global evolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that a\ngeneral two-term Kraus channel - implementable with the addition of just one\nqubit - can raise all fidelities to 1 across the 402 cases, while still\nensuring that the dynamics-matching condition is satisfied.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u91cf\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u975e\u9884\u671f\u6f14\u53d8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u88abU\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\u72b6\u6001\u51fa\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bf9\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e92\u60e0\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1100\uff05\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u7ea694.2\uff05\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u5373\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u6240\u6709\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u4e24\u9879 Kraus \u9805\u5219\u53ef\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6 reaches 1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5339\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u91cf\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the\ntopological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the\ninterface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the\ntopological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our\nplatform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's\ntopologically protected surface states. Through a combination of supercurrent\nsimulations, self-consistent Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson calculations, and\nlarge-scale tight-binding computations, we validate the platform's robustness.\nOur work establishes a practical pathway toward Meissner-mediated topological\nsuperconductivity for realizing robust MZMs in SC/TI hybrid systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper explores a novel approach\nto address these challenges by formulating a stochastic optimization problem\nthat models the uncertain nature of PV power generation and the flexibility of\nbi-directional EV charging.

Floquet codes are a class of\ndynamically generated, stabilizer-based codes in which low-weight parity\nmeasurements are applied in a time-periodic schedule. Furthermore, for several\nFloquet codes, the encoding rate becomes finite even for an infinitely large\nqubit number. However, despite these advantageous properties, existing Floquet\ncodes require handling more intricate, often hypergraph-structured syndromes\nfrom the decoding perspective, which makes decoding comparatively demanding. We\ngive a concrete method for solving this issue by proposing hyperbolic color\nFloquet (HCF) code. To this end, we simultaneously take advantage of hyperbolic\nFloquet and Floquet color codes. Parity measurements in our code consist of the\nrepetitions of six-step measurements on (semi-)hyperbolic three-colorable\ntilings. Since each step just measures $X \\otimes X$ or $Z \\otimes Z$, our code\non the regular $\\{8,3\\}$ lattice has the following three advantages: (i) parity\nmeasurements are weight-2, (ii) for the numbers $k$ and $n$ of logical and\nphysical qubits, respectively, the encoding rate is finite, i.e., $\\lim_{n \\to\n\\infty} k/n = 1/8$, and (iii) the code distance is proportional to $\\log n$.\nFrom the above property, each single-fault event generally affects at most two\ndetectors, which implies ``graph-edge'' syndromes, and hence decoding with a\nminimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder is efficient and virtually\nscales near-linearly in the number of physical qubits $n$. This is a stark\ncontrast to several known Floquet codes because their parity measurements\nrepeat the measurements of $X\\!\\otimes\\!X$, $Y\\!\\otimes\\!Y$, and\n$Z\\!\\otimes\\!Z$, and thus the syndromes are represented as a hypergraph, which\nbasically requires decoders with longer decoding time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aHCF\uff08\u65e0\u9650\u8272Floquet\uff09\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u66f2\u8272\u548cFloquet\u7801\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u539f\u751f\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u7f16\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8ddd\uff08X\u2297X\u6216Z\u2297Z\u6d4b\u91cf\uff09\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4e09\u8272\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u6545\u969c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6700\u591a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e24\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528MWPM\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u8fd1\u4e4e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709Floquet\u7801\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6216\u8d85\u56fe syndrome\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7801\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684Floquet\u7801\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684 syndrome\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7e41\u7410\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u66f2\u8272\u548cFloquet\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8ddd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u8fd1\u4e4e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "result": "HCF\u7f16\u7801\u5177\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8ddd\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4ec5\u4e3a2\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u503c\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u4ee3\u7801\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0elog n\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u5355\u6545\u969c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6700\u591a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e24\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\uff085\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u4e0en\u8fd1\u4e4e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "conclusion": "HCF\u7f16\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u539f\u751f\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709Floquet\u7801\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This off-shell Gibbs free\nenergy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an\nassociated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of\nblack hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which\nis independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the\nFokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by\nconsidering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale\nwith black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can\nbe used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black\nhole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes\nunder a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy\nbecome extremal at the same horizon radius.

Since PRUs are considered weaker than one-way functions, it is crucial to delineate their capabilities and boundaries, particularly in constructing fundamental cryptographic primitives like bit commitments and key agreement.", "method": "The authors employ techniques from quantum information theory and complexity theory. They analyze the problem by considering the distinguishability of identical versus independent Haar unitaries using separable channels. By establishing the difficulty of this task, they argue that PRUs cannot be used to construct the aforementioned cryptographic primitives efficiently.", "result": "The key result of the paper is that QCCC bit commitments and QCCC key agreement cannot be constructed from pseudorandom unitaries in a black-box manner. This is achieved by demonstrating that it is hard to tell apart identical and independent Haar unitaries using separable channels, thereby highlighting the limitations of PRUs in cryptographic applications.", "conclusion": "This work contributes to the understanding of the role and limitations of pseudorandom unitaries in quantum cryptography. It provides evidence that certain cryptographic primitives may indeed require stronger primitives than PRUs, aligning with the existing belief that PRUs are weaker than one-way functions. The findings are significant for the design and analysis of quantum cryptographic protocols, particularly those that rely on classical communication and may have applications in secure communication and computation."}}
