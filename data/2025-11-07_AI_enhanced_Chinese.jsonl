Exceptional points have intriguing effects on the dynamics of systems\ndue to their topological properties. They have been explored in contexts\nincluding optical, microwave, optomechanical, electronic and magnonic systems,\nand have been used to control systems including optical microcavities, the\nlasing modes of a PT-symmetric waveguide, and terahertz pulse generation. A\nchallenging problem that remains open in all of these scenarios is the fully\ndeterministic and direct manipulation of the systems' loss and gain on\ntimescales relevant to coherent control of excitations. Here we demonstrate the\nrapid manipulation of the gain and loss balance of excitations of a magnonic\nhybrid system on durations much shorter than their decay rate, allowing us to\nexploit non-Hermitian physics for coherent control. By encircling an\nexceptional point, we demonstrate population transfer between coupled\nmagnon-polariton modes, and confirm the distinctive chiral nature of\nexceptional point encircling. We then study the effect of driving the system\ndirectly through an exceptional point, and demonstrate that this allows the\ncoupled system to be prepared in an equal superposition of eigenmodes. We also\nshow that the dynamics of the system at the exceptional point are dependent on\nits generalised eigenvectors.

Boltzmann sampling error rate is quantified for standard\nlinear-ramp anneals ranging from $5$ nanosecond annealing times up to $2000$\nmicroseconds on two different D-Wave quantum annealing processors.\nInterestingly, we find some analog hardware parameters which result in a very\nhigh accuracy (down to a TVD of $0.0003$) and low temperature sampling (down to\n$\\beta=32.2$) in a frustrated region of the ANNNI model magnetic phase diagram.\nThis bolsters the viability of current analog quantum computers for\nthermodynamic sampling applications of highly frustrated magnetic spin systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8bba\u6587\u6458\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u673a\u5728Boltzmann\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6 frustration\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u673a\u5728\u9000\u706b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u5e8f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6 frustrations\u7684 magnetic \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91c7\u6837\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u9000\u706b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 D-Wave \u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ece 5 \u7eb3\u79d2\u5230 2000 \u5fae\u79d2\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9000\u706b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86 Boltzmann \u62bd\u6837\u8bef\u5dee\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9000\u706b\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08T(Vec) \u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a 0.0003\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\uff08~ \u03b2=32.2\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728 frustrated \u78c1\u6027\u76f8\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u533a\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u673a\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u8fdb\u884c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91c7\u6837\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6 frustrated\u78c1\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

The proposed ring adopts a Double Bend Achromat (DBA) lattice\nconfiguration and integrates 12 superconducting wigglers to significantly\nenhance radiation damping and minimize the natural emittance. And a bypass line\nis adopted to generate high power coherent radiation. Comprehensive linear and\nnonlinear beam dynamics analyses have been conducted to ensure beam stability\nand robustness across the operational parameter space. The optimized design\nachieves a natural emittance of approximately 0.8 nm and a longitudinal damping\ntime of around 1.4 ms, enabling the efficient buildup of coherent radiation.\nThree-dimensional numerical simulations, incorporating the previously proposed\nangular dispersion-induced microbunching (ADM) mechanism, further confirm the\nsystem's capability to generate high-power EUV coherent radiation, with output\npowers reaching the order of several hundred watts.

Accurate modeling of such systems requires capturing both the\nlong-term statistical properties governed by slow variables and the short-term\ntransient dynamics driven by fast chaotic processes. We present a hybrid\ndata-driven framework that integrates score-based generative modeling with\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to construct reduced-order\nmodels (ROMs) capable of reproducing both regimes. The slow dynamics are\nrepresented by a Langevin equation whose drift is informed by a score function\nlearned via the K-means Gaussian Mixture Model (KGMM) method, ensuring faithful\nreproduction of the system's invariant measure. The fast chaotic forcing is\nmodeled by a NODE trained on delay-embedded residuals extracted from observed\ntrajectories, replacing conventional Gaussian noise approximations. We validate\nthis approach on a hierarchy of prototypical metastable systems driven by\nLorenz 63 dynamics, including bistable potentials with additive and\nmultiplicative forcing, and tristable non-autonomous systems with cycloperiodic\ncomponents. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid framework maintains\nstatistical consistency over long time horizons while accurately forecasting\nrare critical transitions between metastable states with lead times approaching\nthe Lyapunov time of the chaotic driver.

Most of these 3D-printed materials are based on\nceramics or polymers whose mechanical properties vary with frequency. For\nnumerical modeling, it is crucial to characterize this frequency dependency\naccurately to enable realistic finite-element simulations. At the same time,\nthe damping behavior plays a key role in product development, since it governs\na component's response at resonance and thus impacts both performance and\nlongevity. In current research, inverse material characterization methods are\ngetting more and more popular. However, their practical validation and\napplicability on real measurement data have not yet been discussed widely. In\nthis work, we show the identification of two different materials, POM and\nadditively manufactured sintered ceramics, and validate it with experimental\ndata of a well-established measurement technique (dynamic mechanical analysis).\nThe material identification process considers state-of-the-art reduced-order\nmodeling and constrained particle swarm optimization, which are used to fit the\nfrequency response functions of point measurements obtained by a laser Doppler\nvibrometer. This work shows the quality of the method in identifying the\nparameters defining the viscoelastic fractional derivative model, including\ntheir uncertainty. It also illustrates the applicability of this identification\nmethod in the presence of practical difficulties that come along with\nexperimental data such as boundary conditions and noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u75283D\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u3001\u822a\u7a7a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u3002\u9006\u5411\u6750\u6599\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u6df1\u5165\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86POM\u548c\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u7684\u70e7\u7ed3\u9676\u74f7\u4e24\u79cd\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u68b0\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u5206\u6570\u9636\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u56f0\u96be\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77403D\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u3001\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6750\u6599\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8865\u5145\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6fc0\u5149\u901f\u5ea6 vibrometer\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u70b9\u6d4b\u91cf\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u62df\u5408\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u5206\u6570\u9636\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b03D\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u68b0\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The resonant plasmon modes are excited when\nthe slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\\lambda$ satisfy the condition\n$L = \\lambda/8 +n \\times \\lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \\ldots$. The lowest\nresonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth\nof the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional\nhalf-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics.

To further improve the resolution of the\noverall RF spectrum analyzer, we modify the RF-to-optical encoding scheme by\ndirecting the RF signal through a path mismatched interferometer and encoding\nthe outputs of the RF interferometer on separate optical carriers.

Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently\nargued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law)\nscaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM\nwith the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation\nbetween TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic\nquantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding\ndistillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue\nthat TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine\nnon-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex\ntemporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is\nnegligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of\nmeasurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to\narea-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d\ncircuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary\npoints, as well as numerically away from them.

Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer\nsuppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a\nlong-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent.\nFurthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the\ncurrent-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by\na factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from\nextra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel\njunction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on\nthe $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence\nof surface contamination in STM measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing\nmechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces\n\\textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and\nodd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the\ndynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby\ntransforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for\nprobing non-Hermitian physics.

Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional\nnon-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly\nrealized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional\nMinkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most\nsymmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve\ninternal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua\nand the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing\nsome intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of\ninflation.

This allows for both non-vanishing twist and angular momentum. We extend\nearlier work to include higher angular modes. Using the pseudospectral code\nbamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon,\nand a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve\nnear-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest\nnontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete\nself-similarity with echoing period $\\Delta\\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling\nwith exponent $\\gamma\\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work.

In\nconventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances\nentanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced\nmeasurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit\nconfiguration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and\nexterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of\ndistributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an\nentanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime\nunder large detuning to enable readout.

On the boundary, the field\noperator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right\nRindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both\nthese regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of\nthe energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one\npresents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and\nthe second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the\nboundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free\ngeometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the\nRindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the\nboundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion\ncondensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative\neverywhere.

We model\ndistributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal\ntwo-qubit gates, defining the communication complexity of a unitary as the\nminimum number of such nonlocal gates required for its realization.\n  Our contributions are twofold. First, for general $n$-qubit unitaries, we\nimprove upon the trivial $O(4^n)$ communication bound. Considering $k$\npairwise-connected processors (each with $n/k$ data qubits and $m$ ancillas),\nwe prove the communication complexity satisfies $O\\left(\\max\\{4^{(1-1/k)n - m},\nn\\}\\right)$--for example, $O(2^n)$ when $m=0$ and $k=2$--and establish the\ntightness of this upper bound. We further extend the analysis to approximation\nmodels and general network topologies. Second, for special unitaries, we show\nthat both the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Clifford circuits admit\nlinear upper bounds on communication complexity in the exact model,\noutperforming the trivial quadratic bounds applicable to these cases. In the\napproximation model, QFT's communication complexity reduces drastically from\nlinear to logarithmic, while Clifford circuits retain a linear lower bound.\nThese results offer fundamental insights for optimizing communication in\ndistributed quantum unitary implementation, advancing the feasibility of\nlarge-scale distributed quantum computing (DQC) systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our main contribution is a protocol\nthat leverages initial entanglement between the target and control of the\nquantum {\\tt SWITCH} and employs sequential, unsharp measurements on the\ncontrol system, showing that it is possible to guarantee a Bell violation after\nan arbitrarily large number of channel applications. Furthermore, our protocol\nallows for a near-maximal (Tsirelson bound) Bell violation to be achieved at\nany desired round, while still ensuring violations in all preceding rounds.

Using\nsymmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of\nlearning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization\nprogram, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd\nfunctions $f : \\{-1,1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$\nto the maximum (over $T \\in \\cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube\nwhose free variables are exactly $T$.'\n  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal\nversion of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program\ntypically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds\nwithout explicitly resorting to SDP duality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 Timestamps\u5bf9\u5e94\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0b\u9650\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7b80\u6d01\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u96c6\u5408\u65cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u8d1f\u6743\u6297\u654c\u8005\u754c\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
