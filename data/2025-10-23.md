Abstract: The magnetization field of a quantum Hall ferromagnet (QHFM) can host a
variety of spin textures, including skyrmions and magnons. When projected into
the lowest Landau level with $\nu = 1$ filling, the topological (Pontryagin)
charge density of the magnetization field is proportional to the electric
charge density, allowing for long-range spin-spin interactions. Inspired by
recent experimental developments that enable all-electrical magnon generation
and detection, in this work we theoretically demonstrate two phenomena that can
occur due to Coulomb interactions that are unique to QHFMs: magnons can scatter
off of point charges at a distance, and skyrmions can act as transmitters and
receivers for magnons to be transduced between separate layers of a bilayer
QHFM. The latter Coulomb-mediated spin drag effect occurs at arbitrary distance
and could facilitate long-range magnonics, such as detection of spin waves for
future experiments in 2D materials.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very
successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide
variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of
nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding
artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high
voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal
effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced
switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically
detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines
femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential
interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination,
iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of
the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or
conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this
work, we demonstrate a >10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and
Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further
demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating
nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation
amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing
conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak
piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films,
2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many recent advances in our understanding of two-dimensional (2D) electron
systems stem from van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. The assembly process
relies on the weak bonding across interfaces between layered vdW compounds,
making it possible to construct exceptionally clean heterostructures from
chemically and structurally distinct materials - a challenging task for
traditional thin-film growth techniques. Here we demonstrate an additional,
dynamic degree of freedom afforded by vdW interfaces, wherein we use
microstructured polymer stamps to disassemble and reconfigure vdW
heterostructures by sliding. We apply this technique to alter the dielectric
environment of monolayer graphene, perform scanning tunneling microscopy on
semiconducting and air-sensitive monolayers, and manipulate strain-sensitive
moir\'e materials. Together these demonstrations suggest a new paradigm for
assembling and dynamically modifying van der Waals heterostructures, with the
potential to reveal new insights into 2D electron systems.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that a ferromagnetic SrRuO3 layer can produce an out-of-plane anti-damping spin-orbit torque for nanoscale magnetic memories with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, even without an applied magnetic field. The torque has significant contributions from both the spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nanoreading articles suggest that the majority of the time, even if the paper is interesting and relevant, I just want to get to the key insights as quickly as possible. This helps to avoid getting bogged down in details and allows for a more focused understanding of the core concepts.

Method: The paper uses micromagnetic simulations and experiments to demonstrate the existence of an out-of-plane anti-damping spin-orbit torque in a SrRuO3 ferromagnetic layer.

Result: The torque generated by the SrRuO3 layer has a significant out-of-plane component, even without an applied magnetic field. The torque's vector components are characterized, and both the spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current contribute to the torque.

Conclusion: This discovery opens up new possibilities for designing and optimizing nanoscale magnetic memory devices.

Abstract: To achieve efficient anti-damping switching of nanoscale magnetic memories
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using spin-orbit torque requires that
the anti-damping spin-orbit torque have a strong out-of-plane component. The
spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current produced by
a ferromagnetic layer are candidate mechanisms for producing such an
out-of-plane anti-damping torque, but both require that the magnetic moment of
the spin source layer be canted partly out of the sample plane at zero applied
magnetic field. Here we demonstrate such a canted configuration for a
ferromagnetic SrRuO3 layer and we characterize all vector components of the
torque that it produces, including non-zero out-of-plane anti-damping torques.
We verify that the out-of-plane spin component can be tuned by the orientation
of magnetic moment, with significant contributions from both the spin anomalous
Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current.

Conclusion: 通过研究两层BN夹层下的蜂窝石墨烯结构，揭示了多对层材料中复杂的电子行为，特别是qBZ形成的现象，为范德华异构体的工程应用提供了新的途径。

Abstract: When monolayer graphene is crystallographically aligned to hexagonal boron
nitride (BN), a moir\'e superlattice is formed, producing characteristic
satellite Dirac peaks in the electronic band structure. Aligning a second BN
layer to graphene creates two coexisting moir\'e patterns, which can interfere
to produce periodic, quasi-periodic or non-periodic superlattices, depending on
their relative alignment. Here, we investigate one of the simplest realizations
of such a double-moir\'e structure, graphene encapsulated between two BN
layers, using dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures. Our setup
allows \textit{in situ} control of the top BN alignment while keeping the
bottom BN fixed. By systematically mapping the charge transport as a function
of BN angular alignment, we identify the simultaneous signatures of the
original moir\'es, super-moir\'es, and a third set of features corresponding to
quasi-Brillouin zones (qBZ) formed when the system's periodicity becomes
ill-defined. Comparing our measurements with theoretical models, we provide the
first experimental mapping of the qBZs as a function of angular alignment. Our
results establish a direct experimental link between moir\'e interference and
qBZ formation, opening new avenues for engineering electronic structures in
multi-aligned 2D heterostructures.

Abstract: Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic
antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB)
containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable
with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process
of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in
the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer
has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the
rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as
black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth
distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes,
and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our
analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB
the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure
rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to $\sim 80\%$. We also
considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not
reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the
transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case
where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the
important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the
light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the
high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole
moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship
between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could
drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices.

### [7] [Thermal Hall conductivity of semi-metallic graphite dominated by ambipolar phonon drag](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19570)
*Qiaochao Xiang,Xiaokang Li,Xiaodong Guo,Zengwei Zhu,Kamran Behnia*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discovers a significant thermal Hall effect in graphite beyond the expected electron contribution, achieving a record Hall Lorenz number.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermal Hall effect across various quasi-particles in materials like graphite is crucial for both fundamental physics and potential applications in thermoelectric materials.

Method: Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples were tested to measure thermal Hall conductivity, analyzing contributions from electronic, phononic, and phonon drag effects.

Result: The study reveals that the thermal Hall conductivity, κxy, is two orders of magnitude higher than expected from electronic carriers alone, resulting in a record Hall Lorenz number (164.9×10^-8 V²K⁻²) corresponding to approximately 67 L0 (the largest observed in metals).

Conclusion: The findings indicate that ambipolar phonon drag predominantly contributes to the thermal Hall response in graphite, challenging previous assumptions about the thermal contributions of electrons and suggesting new avenues for materials with enhanced thermoelectric properties.

Abstract: It is now known that in addition to electrons, other quasi-particles such as
phonons and magnons can also generate a thermal Hall signal. Graphite is a
semimetal with extremely mobile charge carriers of both signs and a large
lattice thermal conductivity. We present a study of the thermal Hall effect in
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples with electronic, phononic and
phonon drag contributions to the thermal Hall signal. The measured thermal Hall
conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$) is two orders of magnitude higher than what is
expected by electronic carriers according to the electrical Hall conductivity
and the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding a record Hall Lorenz number of
$164.9\times10^{-8}V^2 K^{-2}$ ($\sim$67$L_0$) - the largest ever observed in a
metal. The temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity
significantly differs from its longitudinal counterpart, ruling out a purely
phononic origin of the non-electronic component. Based on the temperature
dependence and the amplitudes of the Seebeck and Nernst responses, we
demonstrate that ambipolar phonon drag dominates the thermal Hall response of
graphite.

### [8] [Universal non-Hermitian valley filtering via uniform dissipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19588)
*Sijie Yue,Wentao Xie,Kai Shao,Hong-yu Zou,Bingbing Wang,Hong-xiang Sun,Y. X. Zhao,Wei Chen,Haoran Xue*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A universal mechanism for valley filtering using non-Hermitian physics achieves efficient valley polarization in various platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling valley states in materials is crucial for electronics and photonics. Current methods rely on tailored structures, which may not be scalable.
This work shows how uniform loss can be used to achieve valley polarization, offering a simpler and more scalable approach.

Method: The researchers propose a non-Hermitian mechanism where valleys experience different losses due to background dissipation. They report experiments in an acoustic crystal that show switchable and robust valley polarization through large-scale field mapping.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the system creates a contrast in propagation lengths between valleys based on their intrinsic group velocity differences. This results in efficient valley filtering without requiring any special lattice structures, tailored excitations, or external fields.

Conclusion: This finding provides a simple and effective approach for generating valley-polarized states, opening up new avenues for the development of valley-based devices in both electronic and photonic platforms.

Abstract: Valley, as a ubiquitous degree of freedom in lattices, has found wide
applications in both electronic and classical-wave devices in recent years.
However, achieving valley-polarized states, a prerequisite for valley-based
operations, still remains challenging. Here, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a universal non-Hermitian mechanism for valley filtering using only
uniform background dissipation, which creates a propagation length contrast
between valleys through their intrinsic group velocity differences. We
implement this concept in an acoustic crystal, observing switchable and robust
valley polarization of sound through large-scale field mapping. Remarkably, our
approach is solely based on uniform loss, without the need for any special
lattice structures, tailored excitations, or external fields. We further
provide designs of our non-Hermitian valley filter on photonic and electronic
platforms. Our results offer a simple and effective solution to
valley-polarized state generation and may advance the development of novel
valley-based devices in both classical and quantum regimes.

Abstract: The symmetry-broken correlated states in twisted double bilayer graphene
(TDBG) can be tuned via several external knobs, including twist angle,
displacement field, and carrier density. However, a direct, momentum-resolved
characterization of how these parameters reshape the flat-band structure
remains limited. In this study, we employ micro focused angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the flat-band dispersion of TDBG at a
twist angle of 1.6, systematically varying the displacement field and carrier
density via electrostatic gating. We directly observe multiple flat moir'e
minibands near charge neutrality, including a flat remote valence band residing
below the low-energy flat-band manifold. Furthermore, the dominant Coulomb
repulsive energy over the flat- band bandwidth suggests favorable conditions
for the emergence of interaction-driven correlated phenomena in TDBG. These
findings establish that the formation and evolution of flat bands in TDBG
arises from the interplay between the electron filling and the displacement
field.

Abstract: We develop a unified, single-scale description of thermodynamics and quantum
oscillations in electronic systems with a uniform areal density of screw
dislocations under a uniform magnetic field. A single tunable gap,
$\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ with $\omega_{eff}=\omega_{c}+\omega_{cl}$, organizes all
equilibrium observables obtained from a compact harmonic-oscillator partition
function: free energy, internal energy, entropy, heat capacity, magnetization,
magnetic susceptibility, and magnetocaloric responses collapse onto universal
hyperbolic kernels in $x=\hbar|\omega_{eff}|/(2k_{B}T)$. We identify a
compensated-field regime where the transverse gap closes and the heat capacity
reaches an equipartition plateau, providing a sharp signature of magnetoelastic
interference. In transport and torque, the same scale rigidly shifts the Hall
fan and compresses the $1/B$ period of de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations when expressed in $1/B_{eff}$, enabling a phase-unwarping protocol
that metrologizes the dislocation density from a single field sweep. In
mesoscopic samples, boundary corrections to the Landau degeneracy generate
finite-size calorimetric oscillations that diagnose the effective magnetic
length. Moderate disorder and weak interactions preserve the kernel structure
while smoothing amplitudes. We outline an experimental roadmap combining
on-chip calorimetry, torque magnetometry, and transport, and discuss
device-level opportunities in caloritronics and strain engineering,
magnetocaloric microcooling, magnetoelastic heat switching, and dilatometric
transduction, where the single scale $\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ enables rational
design and optimization.

### [11] [Adaptive Ising machine based on phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi-harmonic external driving with noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19648)
*Eleonora Raimondo,Andrea Grimaldi,Vasyl Tyberkevych,Riccardo Tomasello,Anna Giordano,Mario Carpentieri,Andrei Slavin,Massimo Chiappini,Giovanni Finocchio*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper introduces a universal theory of phase auto-oscillators driven by a bi-harmonic signal with noise, demonstrating how deterministic phase locking and stochastic phase slips can be tuned by adjusting the driving components. It validates this theory using different machines and introduces adaptive Ising machines (AIM) that combine deterministic and probabilistic operations, showing their performance compared to other machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to develop versatile computation platforms, particularly for hybrid optimization and inference, leveraging the tunability of phase-based systems.

Method: The research employs a combination of theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and hardware demonstrations using a spin-torque nano-oscillator. It integrates deterministic and probabilistic Ising machine paradigms and introduces the concept of adaptive Ising machines.

Result: The developed adaptive Ising machines (AIM) successfully demonstrate the transition between deterministic and probabilistic computation. The results indicate that AIM exhibits complementary performance compared to other Ising machine variants, especially in scalability and adaptability to combinatorial optimization problems.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step toward designing scalable, CMOS-compatible hardware for hybrid optimization and inference by leveraging the tunability of phase-based systems.

Abstract: We introduce a universal theory of phase auto-oscillators driven by a bi
harmonic signal (having frequency components close to single and double of the
free-running oscillator frequency) with noise. With it, we show how
deterministic phase locking and stochastic phase slips can be continuously
tuned by varying the relative amplitudes and frequencies of the driving
components. Using, as an example, a spin-torque nano-oscillator, we numerically
validate this theory by implementing a deterministic Ising machine paradigm, a
probabilistic one, and dual-mode operation of the two. This demonstration
introduces the concept of adaptive Ising machines (AIM), a unified
oscillator-based architecture that dynamically combines both regimes within the
same hardware platform by properly tuning the amplitudes of the bi-harmonic
driving relative to the noise strength. Benchmarking on different classes of
combinatorial optimization problems, the AIM exhibits complementary performance
compared to oscillator based Ising machines and probabilistic Ising machines,
with adaptability to the specific problem class. This work introduces the first
OIM capable of transitioning between deterministic and probabilistic
computation taking advantage of a proper design of the trade-off between the
strength of phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi harmonic external
driving and noise, opening a path toward scalable, CMOS compatible hardware for
hybrid optimization and inference.

Motivation: Understanding spin-controlled materials for novel electronic devices.

Method: Integrated theoretical and experimental approach using DFT.

Result: Observation of reciprocal spin-polarized functionalities in altermagnets.

Conclusion: Foundational material for spin-controlled flux generators and injectors.

Abstract: We show that rolling a two-dimensional altermagnet into a nanotube turns it
into a spin-programmable chiral nanosolenoid with two reciprocal, SOC-free
functionalities. (i) Direct: injecting a single-spin-polarized current produces
a steady helical current whose handedness is locked to the spin orientation,
yielding opposite axial magnetic fields for opposite spins. (ii) Inverse: a
time-varying axial flux Phi(t) induces a circumferential Faraday field E_theta
= -(dPhi/dt)/(2 pi R) that drives equal-magnitude, opposite-sign axial charge
currents in the two spin channels, Iz^up = - Iz^down, thereby pumping a pure
spin current Is = (hbar/2e)(Iz^up - Iz^down) with zero net charge flow. Both
effects arise from the interplay between momentum-odd spin polarization
inherent to altermagnets and the screw symmetry of the rolled geometry, and
persist in the complete absence of spin-orbit coupling. Using V2Se2O as a
prototype, first-principles calculations reveal spin-dependent chiral wave
functions near both the conduction- and valence-band edges. These results
establish a nonrelativistic route toward compact spin-controlled flux
generators and charge-neutral spin injectors in light-element materials without
static magnetic bias.

Motivation: Advancements in materials science require efficient navigation of chemical space, but current methods lack scalability. Foundation models offer a scalable solution by learning generalizable scientific concepts.

Method: MIST uses a novel tokenization scheme that captures nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, enabling comprehensive learning of molecular structures. The models are trained on a diverse range of molecules and fine-tuned to predict over 400 structure-property relationships.

Result: MIST achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and quantum chemistry. It demonstrates real-world applications, including multi-objective optimization and stereochemical reasoning.

Conclusion: MIST represents a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery and design through foundation models, paving the way for compute-optimal scientific models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of atomistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties from
molecular structures underpins materials innovation. Existing computational and
experimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate
chemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled
datasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse
application domains. Here we develop MIST, a family of molecular foundation
models with up to an order of magnitude more parameters and data than prior
works. Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures
nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse
range of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400
structure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and
quantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve
real-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte
solvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction,
stereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and
multi-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using
mechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends
not explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn
generalizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized
Bayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of
model development by an order of magnitude. The methods and findings presented
here represent a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery,
design, and optimization using foundation models and provide valuable guidance
for training compute-optimal scientific foundation models.

Method: 我们展示了如何构建MLIPs来计算nile红这种溶色剂系统的光谱，在各种溶剂中。我们采用迭代主动学习技术以提高效率，减少所需的DFT计算数量和规模。我们比较了三种方法：分别为每个adiabatic状态生成单独的MLIPs、使用一个基础MLIP和Δ-ML的激发差，以及使用三头_multiheaded ML模型。

Result: 通过比较预测的吸收和发射光谱与实验光谱结果，我们得出结论：将更大尺寸的溶剂系统包含在训练数据中，并且使用Δ模型预测激发能差，能使预测的uv-vis光谱准确且Affordable。这与基于时间依赖的dft的方法的精度相当。

Conclusion: 我们的研究展示了如何构建MLIPs来有效计算nile红在各种溶剂中的光谱，该研究通过结合迭代主动学习技术和使用Δ模型预测激发能差，验证了该方法的高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) offer a powerful combination
of abilities for accelerating theoretical spectroscopy calculations utilising
both ensemble sampling and trajectory post-processing for inclusion of vibronic
effects, which can be very challenging for traditional ab initio MD approaches.
We demonstrate a workflow that enables efficient generation of MLIPs for the
solvatochromic dye nile red system, in a variety of solvents. We use iterative
active learning techniques to make this process as efficient as possible in
terms of number and size of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
Additionally, we compare the efficacy of various methodologies: generating
distinct MLIPs for each adiabatic state, using one ground state MLIP in
combination with delta-ML of excitation energies, and using a three-headed
multiheaded ML model. To evaluate the validity of the resulting models, we
compare predicted absorption and emission spectra to experimental spectra. We
found that the incorporation of larger solvent systems into training data, and
the use of delta models to predict the excitation energies, enables the
accurate and affordable prediction of UV-Vis spectra with accuracy equivalent
to the ground truth method, which is time-dependent DFT in this case.

Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the static and dynamic
polarizability of the barium monohydroxide ($^{138}$BaOH) molecule, using
relativistic coupled-cluster theory. By thoroughly investigating the dependence
of the calculated polarizabilities on computational parameters (basis set size,
treatment of relativity, level of treatment of electron correlation, and
vibrational corrections), a procedure to determine uncertainties is constructed
and applied. The dipole moment of BaOH is also calculated and compared to
experiment, confirming the accuracy of the predicted polarizabilities. The
static and dynamic ($\lambda=1064\;\text{nm}$) polarizability was calculated
for both the ground state and the (010) vibrational bending mode, the latter
state being particularly interesting for a wide range of quantum experiments.
The ground state static polarizabilities were calculated to be 200.8(24) a.u.

TL;DR: The paper revises Marcus theory to account for spatially anisotropic environments, showing that coupling to anisotropy leads to different activation barriers for CO₂ redox on a gold electrode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marcus theory is a fundamental framework in electron transfer studies, and its extension to anisotropic environments is crucial for understanding complex systems like biomolecules and electrochemical interfaces.

Method: The authors developed a formalism using constrained ab initio trajectories to calculate the coupled CIET free-energy surface, allowing for the analysis of activation barriers in anisotropic conditions.

Result: The method predicts strong coupling to anisotropy, resulting in significantly different activation barriers for CO₂ redox compared to either coordinate alone.

Conclusion: This work provides a new theoretical framework for studying electron transfer in spatially anisotropic environments, with implications for various fields including electrochemistry and molecular biology.

Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are
sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially
anisotropic environments, such as electrochemical interfaces or biomolecular
structures, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable
describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional
reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate,
we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled
Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab
initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method
reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different
activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.

*Cancan Shao,Rixin Xie,Zhecun Shi,Linjun Wang*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning-based method to determine the optimal decoherence time for surface hopping simulations in high-dimensional systems. The method builds on exact quantum dynamics results and shows exceptional performance compared to other formulas.Validators: the approach appears methodologically sound with clear motivation, and the results seem strong given the benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to facilitate surface hopping simulations in more complex systems by reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. This is a practical need in the field of quantum chemistry and materials science.

Method: The method involves using exact quantum dynamics to inform a machine learning strategy. It introduces a novel way to define effective nuclear kinetic energy using non-adiabatic coupling vectors and binary operations to generate descriptor spaces. The optimal decoherence time is learned from data derived from these descriptors.

Result: The developed formula performs exceptionally well in benchmark tests across a large dataset, outperforming other available formulas consistently and uniformly.

Conclusion: This work provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for determining optimal decoherence times, significantly advancing the application of machine learning in quantum dynamics simulations.

Abstract: In our recent work (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 7680), we utilized the
exact quantum dynamics results as references and proposed a general machine
learning method to obtain the optimal decoherence time formula for surface
hopping simulation. Here, we extend this strategy from one-dimensional systems
to the much more intricate scenarios with multiple nuclear dimensions.
Different from the one-dimensional situation, an effective nuclear kinetic
energy is defined by extracting the component of nuclear momenta along the
non-adiabatic coupling vector. Combined with the energy difference between
adiabatic states, high-order descriptor space can be generated by binary
operations. Then the optimal decoherence time formula can be obtained by
machine learning procedures based on the full quantum dynamics reference data.
Although we only use the final channel populations in 24 scattering samples as
training data for machine learning, the obtained optimal decoherence time
formula can well reproduce the time evolution of the reduced and spatial
distribution of population. As benchmarked in a large number of 56840 one- and
two-dimensional samples, the optimal decoherence time formula shows
exceptionally high and uniform performance when compared with all other
available formulas.

Abstract: Elucidating the catalytic descriptor that accurately characterizes the
structure-activity relationships of typical catalysts for various important
heterogeneous catalytic reactions is pivotal for designing high-efficient
catalytic systems. Here, an interpretable machine learning technique was
employed to identify the key determinants governing the nitrate reduction
reaction ($\rm NO_3RR$) performance across 286 single-atom catalysts (SACs)
with the active sites anchored on double-vacancy $\rm BC_3$ monolayers. Through
Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis with reliable predictive
accuracy, we quantitatively demonstrated that, favorable $\rm NO_3RR$ activity
stems from a delicate balance among three critical factors: low $\rm N_V$,
moderate $\rm D_N$, and specific doping patterns. Building upon these insights,
we established a descriptor ($\psi$) that integrates the intrinsic catalytic
properties and the intermediate O-N-H angle ($\theta$), effectively capturing
the underlying structure-activity relationship. Guided by this, we further
identified 16 promising catalysts with predicted low limiting potential
($U_{\rm L}$). Importantly, these catalysts are composed of cost-effective
non-precious metal elements and are predicted to surpass most reported
catalysts, with the best-performing Ti-V-1N1 is predicted to have an ultra-low
$U_{\rm L}$ of $-0.10$ V.

Abstract: The electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene induces a robust and reversible
conductor-insulator transition, of strong interest in logic-and-memory
applications. However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it
proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the
formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's
electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative
hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of
protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene
can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale
corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons
results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more
stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of
ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control
these materials' electronic properties.

Abstract: Strong coupling with circularly polarized vacuum fluctuations offers a viable
route to manipulate molecular chirality. While experiments are advancing toward
the realization of chiral cavities, a mean-field theoretical framework for
describing electron-photon interaction in this platform has been missing. Here,
we present a mean-field theory that can be systematically improved to capture
the chiral correlation effects responsible for the enantioselective power of
chiral light. We use strong coupling M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory for
accessing the excitation manifold of electrons and chiral virtual photons. We
apply the developed methods to selected chiral systems and show that the
mean-field theory captures cavity frequency dispersion, but fails to describe
the chiral discrimination arising from coupled electron-photon excitations.

TL;DR: A rescaled Manning potential is identified from the scattering of small-amplitude excitations with a kink defect in a nonlinear Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian modeling a 1D molecular chain subjected to a hyperbolic substrate potential. The potential's flexibility in describing molecular excitations in systems with inversion symmetry, such as hydrogen-bonded crystals, α-helix proteins, polymers, and quantum tunneling systems, along with its relevance to double-well models with deformable profiles, highlights its versatility in understanding physical phenomena involving equilibrium configurations susceptible to substitutions, dilution, and solvation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study likely aims to understand the scattering properties and potential energy landscapes of molecular systems using a general theoretical framework.

Method: An analysis of scatterings is conducted with a kink defect within the framework of a nonlinear Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian that models a 1D molecular chain under a hyperbolic substrate potential. Isotope effects are incorporated by introducing a parameter into the potential, allowing it to describe a wide range of molecular systems with inversion symmetry.

Result: A rescaled Manning potential is derived from the scattering data.

Conclusion: This work provides a versatile and generalized model for studying molecular excitations and related phenomena in diverse systems.

Abstract: A rescaled Manning potential is obtained in the analysis of scatterings of
small- amplitude excitations with a kink defect. The generic model is a
nonlinear Klein- Gordon Hamiltonian describing a one-dimensional chain of
identical molecules, sub- jected to an hyperbolic single-particle substrate
potential. To account for isotope effects that are likely to affect
characteristic equilibrium parameters of the molec- ular chain, including the
lattice spacing (i.e. the characteristic intermolecuar dis- tance) and/or the
barrier height, the hyperbolic substrate potential is endowed with a real
parameter whose variation makes it suitable for the description of molecu- lar
excitations in a broad range of systems with inversion symmetry. These include
hydrogen-bonded molecular crystals, {\alpha}-helix proteins, long polymer
chains and two- state quantum-tunneling systems in general. Double-well models
with deformable profiles are relevant in physical contexts where the
equilibrium configurations are sensitive to atomic or molecular substitutions,
dilution, solvation and so on.

Motivation: 研究者们意识到使用机器学习势能函数（MLIPs）进行分子动力学模拟时，依赖于来自密度泛函理论（DFT）的数据集的质量。高质量的数据对于提高MLIP的准确性至关重要。

Method: 研究者对多个数据集（SPICE, Transition1x, ANI-1x, ANI-1xbb, AIMNet2, QCML, 和 OMol25）进行了分析，计算了它们的非零净力，并与使用更精确的DFT参数重新计算的力进行了比较。

Result: 研究结果表明，多个数据集存在显著的非零DFT净力，并且力分量的误差显著，尤其是在SPICE和ANI-1x数据集中分别达到1.7 meV/Å和33.2 meV/Å。这说明使用高收敛性的DFT数据是训练更准确的MLIP模型的关键。

Conclusion: 确保DFT数据的高收敛性是训练准确的机器学习势能函数的基础。

Abstract: Training of general-purpose machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
relies on large datasets with properties usually computed with density
functional theory (DFT). A pre-requisite for accurate MLIPs is that the DFT
data are well converged to minimize numerical errors. A possible symptom of
errors in DFT force components is nonzero net force. Here, we consider net
forces in datasets including SPICE, Transition1x, ANI-1x, ANI-1xbb, AIMNet2,
QCML, and OMol25. Several of these datasets suffer from significant nonzero DFT
net forces. We also quantify individual force component errors by comparison to
recomputed forces using more reliable DFT settings at the same level of theory,
and we find significant discrepancies in force components averaging from 1.7
meV/{\AA} in the SPICE dataset to 33.2 meV/{\AA} in the ANI-1x dataset. These
findings underscore the importance of well converged DFT data as increasingly
accurate MLIP architectures become available.

Abstract: We investigate the interaction-induced resistivity of ultracold fermions in a
three-dimensional optical lattice. In situ observations of transport dynamics
enable the determination of real and imaginary conductivity (or resistivity).
In the strongly interacting metallic regime, we observe a striking saturation
of the current-dissipation rate to a value independent of the interaction
strength. This behavior is quantitatively captured by a dissipation model that
uses a renormalized two-body scattering matrix. The highest observed
dissipation rates approach, but do not reach, the unitarity bound on two-body
scattering in the lattice, owing to momentum dispersion. We further measure the
temperature dependence of resistivity in the strongly interacting limit and
compare it to the predicted asymptotic behaviors. These results provide a clear
microscopic understanding of bounded resistivity of low-density metals, thus
providing a useful benchmark for studies of strongly correlated atomic and
electronic systems.

Abstract: Fermionic cold atoms in optical traps provide viable quantum simulators of
correlation effects in electronic systems. For dressed Rydberg atoms in
two-dimensional traps with out-of-plane dipole moments, a realistic model of
the pairwise interaction is of repulsive dipolar $1/r^3$ form at long range,
softened to a constant at short range. This study provides parameterizations of
fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energy data for ferromagnetic (one-component)
and paramagnetic (two-component) two-dimensional homogeneous Fermi fluids of
interacting dipolar atoms. We find itinerant ferromagnetism to be unstable

Abstract: Transport properties are central to characterizing quantum matter, yet their
extraction typically requires external forcing and time-resolved measurements.
In this work, we propose a scheme to access transport coefficients directly
from measurements of local, static ground-state currents -- quantities readily
accessible in quantum-engineered platforms. By exploiting the exponential decay
of correlations in gapped systems and the finite velocity of correlation
spreading, we demonstrate that the local Hall response can be reconstructed
from a small set of quasi-local current observables. We derive explicit
relations connecting these static observables to a practical local Chern
marker, and introduce a scalable digital protocol for measuring the required
generalized currents in cold-atom quantum simulators. Numerical simulations of
a non-interacting Chern insulator validate our approach. Moreover, the scheme
extends naturally to fractional Chern insulators and other strongly correlated
systems, even at finite temperature, offering a broadly applicable route to
probing transport in engineered quantum matter.

Abstract: We show that retarded Green's functions of black hole spacetimes can be
expressed as a convergent mode sum everywhere in spacetime. At late times a
quasinormal mode sum converges, while at early times a Matsubara (or,
Euclidean) mode sum converges. The two regions are separated by a lightcone
which scatters from the black hole potential. The Matsubara sum is a Fourier
series on the Euclidean thermal circle associated to the early time region. We
illustrate our results for P\"oschl-Teller, BTZ, and Schwarzschild. In the case
of Schwarzschild, we express the branch cut contribution as a convergent sum of
de Sitter quasinormal modes as $\Lambda\to 0^+$, and exploit recent exact
solutions to the Heun connection problem. In each case we analytically show
convergence by studying the asymptotics of residue sums and also provide
numerical demonstrations.

*Milos Ertola Urtubey,Daniela Pérez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper compares the Blandford-Znajek mechanism in Kerr black holes and Kerr-type wormholes, finding that the electromagnetic flux in wormhole spacetimes is weaker than in Kerr black holes, with the difference increasing as their geometries diverge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper was likely to extend our understanding of energy extraction mechanisms in different spacetime geometries, specifically comparing black holes and wormholes.

Method: The authors performed theoretical analysis by solving the stream equations in a rotating Kerr-type wormhole spacetime and derived expressions for the magnetic field and Poynting flux. They then compared these results with those from Kerr black holes.

Result: The main result is that the electromagnetic flux in the wormhole spacetime is weaker than in the Kerr black hole case, and this difference becomes more significant as the geometries of the black hole and wormhole become increasingly different.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the understanding of energy extraction processes in alternative spacetime geometries, showing that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is less efficient in Kerr-type wormholes compared to Kerr black holes under the same conditions.

Abstract: If a black hole is immersed in a magnetosphere,its rotational energy can be
transferred to the electromagnetic field and escape as a Poynting flux to
infinity. This process of extraction of rotational energy is known as the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism. It relies on the presence of both a magnetosphere
and an ergosphere surrounding the black hole. Previously, we showed that
rotating wormholes are also capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process
of accreting magnetized matter. In this work, we re-examine the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism in the case of a Kerr-type wormhole. For the first
time, we solve the stream equation in a rotating wormhole spacetime and derive
analytical expressions for the magnetic field. We then compute the associated
Poynting flux. Our results indicate that the electromagnetic flux in the
wormhole spacetime is weaker than in the Kerr case, and this difference becomes
more pronounced as the geometries of the two spacetimes increasingly deviate.

Abstract: We present a complete pipeline for detecting and characterising gravitational
waves (GWs) produced by the inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes in data
from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The analysis framework
relies on an efficient time-frequency implementation of an adaptive
semi-coherent detection statistic, which we show to be robust against
non-stationary noise and the presence of gaps of varying duration and cadence.
The search is able to detect signals down to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio
$\approx$ 11 over the full parameter space of black holes with spins aligned to
the orbital angular momentum and orbital eccentricity $\leq$ 0.01 when deployed
on the 2-year-long LISA Data Challenge Yorsh. The search can be run within a
day using $\approx$ 40 GPUs. The techniques presented here have wider
applications in GW astronomy, in particular the search for extreme-mass-ratio
inspirals in LISA data.

Abstract: The growing number of binary black hole mergers detected through
gravitational waves offers unprecedented insight into their underlying
population, yet their astrophysical formation channels remain unresolved. We
present a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using
their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across
cosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated
with three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries
embedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For
mergers at redshift $z \lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering
signatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current
ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Using mock catalogs for next-
generation facilities such as Cosmic Explorer, we find that their sensitivities
would enable differentiation of these formation pathways out to redshift $z
\sim 5$ within the first decade of observations. This approach provides a new
framework to link gravitational-wave populations with the large-scale structure
of the Universe. By treating black hole mergers as cosmological tracers, our
results demonstrate how cross- correlations between gravitational-wave catalogs
and the cosmic matter field can constrain the relative contribution of stellar,
AGN, and primordial channels, offering a complementary probe to population-
inference studies. These findings underscore the emerging potential of
gravitational-wave cosmology to reveal where and how black holes form and merge
across cosmic history.

### [32] [Imprints of Topological Thermodynamics on Black Hole Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19359)
*Yue Chu,Chen-Hao Wu,Ya-Peng Hu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study uses Duan's topological method to classify critical points in quantum anomalous black holes in 4D spacetime by their topological charge Q=+/-1 or 0. It builds on previous work that examined AdS black holes, finding that while Q=+1 and Q=0 cases show limited patterns, the Q=-1 case consistently exhibits notable dynamical similarities across black hole solutions, suggesting an intricate connection between topological thermodynamics and dynamical behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermodynamic properties and dynamical behavior of black holes, especially in higher dimensions and under quantum corrections, is crucial for advancing our knowledge of quantum gravity and spacetime structure.

Method: The researchers applied Duan's topological classification method to analyze the critical points of quantum anomalous black holes. They considered three types of critical points: Q=+1, Q=-1, and Q=0, leveraging previously established results for Reissner-Nordstroem and Born-Infeld black holes.

Result: The main findings are: (1) All three critical points appear in quantum anomalous black holes in 4D spacetime; (2) Quasinormal modes of scalar perturbations show oscillation frequencies and damping rates increasing with black hole radius at critical temperature; (3) The Q=-1 case exhibits consistent dynamical characteristics across different black hole solutions, hinting at a nontrivial interplay between topology and dynamics.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of black hole critical points and their thermodynamic/morphological dynamics, particularly identifying a significant pattern in the Q=-1 case across various black hole solutions.

Abstract: By employing Duan's topological method, we classify critical points by their
topological charge Q = +/-1 or 0. Previous work (Wei et al., Phys. Rev. D 105,
104003, 2022) investigated two typical anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes: the
Reissner-Nordstroem (RN) case (with only one critical point Q = -1) and the
Born-Infeld (BI) case (with two critical points Q = +/-1). In this work, we
first find that all three types of critical points appear in quantum anomalous
black holes for 4D spacetime. We then compute the quasinormal modes of massless
scalar perturbations near these critical points and find that both the
oscillation frequency and damping rate increase with the black hole radius at
the critical temperature. Besides such common behavior, although the Q = +1 and
Q = 0 cases do not show a discernible pattern due to the limited number of
samples, the Q = -1 case exhibits very similar dynamical characteristics across
all three black hole solutions, implying a nontrivial connection between
topological thermodynamics and dynamics.

Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers provide a laboratory for probing fundamental
physics through their gravitational- wave emission and electromagnetic
counterparts. In particular, they may allow us to explore signatures of physics
beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity regimes, such as those of dark
matter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled
as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system.
Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the
binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential
impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the
scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At
sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a
dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and
suppression of the dynamical ejecta. For densities motivated by astrophysical
considerations, however, these effects remain small and are unlikely to be
detectable with current or next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.

Abstract: We provide insight about the full form of the equations for matter density
perturbations and the scalar Bardeen metric potentials in general $f(R)$
theories of gravity. When considering viable modifications to the standard
$\Lambda$CDM background, the full scale-dependent equations for the metric
perturbations are provided and are shown to match the ones obtained with the
quasistatic approximation. We investigate the impact of the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki
model on the late-time growth of structures. We find that updated late-time
growth of structure data imposes $|f_{R_0}|\lesssim10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ and thus
conclude that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model contributes no significant
phenomenology at both background and perturbative level beyond the effective
cosmological constant encompassed in its definition. This conclusion points to
the survival of the present tension between early and late measurements of
$\sigma_8$, as the Hu-Sawicki model can only worsen this issue or at best
reproduce the results from the current concordance cosmological model. The
generalized perturbative method showcased in this work can be applied to more
elaborate $f(R)$ models to isolate genuine higher-order signatures beyond the
quasistatic approximation.

Abstract: We consider the observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a
reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormhole. This wormhole, built in
the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity coupled to a Maxwell field using a
junction conditions formalism, lacks horizons but features photon spheres on
each side of the throat, described by different effective potentials and at
different locations. This fact allows a portion of the light rays arriving to
the observer's screen on one side of the throat to have explored a part of the
space-time on the other side, bringing information about the geometry gathered
there. In this setting we simulate the optical appearance of such an asymmetric
wormhole when illuminated by thin accretion disks, investigating scenarios with
either one or two (on each side of the throat) disks, revealing a rich
multi-photon ring structure due to light crossing the throat, and a strong
reduction in the size of the central brightness depression region. These new
rings are more numerous and far more luminous in the two-disk case than in the
single-disk case, and the shadow's size reduction far more acute, making a neat
distinction as compared to canonical black hole images. These results highlight
the potential of high-resolution imaging in providing smoking guns for the
existence of ultra-compact objects distinct from black holes via their
multi-ring structure.

Abstract: Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an
exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational
physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study
the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We
consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta
($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and
study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and
masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple
analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We
study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger
emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized
by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates
a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the
parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or
exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others
display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of
these events.

Conclusion: 旋转性毛发状黑洞在合理范围内可能稳定。

Abstract: Rotating hairy black holes (RHBHs) are axisymmetric equilibrium solutions of
the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, consisting of a spinning black hole
surrounded by a toroidal distribution of complex scalar field. Despite their
potential astrophysical relevance, the stability of these configurations
-naturally expected to form through superradiant growth of light bosonic
fields- remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the stability of RHBHs
by performing fully non-linear numerical evolutions of several configurations
that differ in the relative mass contribution of the scalar-field torus. We
find that configurations in which the scalar field mass is subdominant compared
to the black hole mass remain stable throughout the evolution. In contrast,
when the scalar-field mass dominates, the system develops an instability akin
to the non-axisymmetric instability observed in rotating boson stars. Given the
expected limits on the scalar-field mass growth achievable through
superradiance, our results suggest that rotating hairy black holes formed
predominantly by this process are expected to be stable.

Abstract: Classical simulation of quantum circuits plays a crucial role in validating
quantum hardware and delineating the boundaries of quantum advantage. Among the
most effective simulation techniques are those based on the stabilizer extent,
which quantifies the overhead of representing non-Clifford operations as linear
combinations of Clifford unitaries. However, finding optimal decompositions
rapidly becomes intractable as it constitutes a superexponentially large
optimization problem. In this work, we exploit symmetries in the computation of
the stabilizer extent, proving that for real, diagonal, and real-diagonal
unitaries, the optimization can be restricted to the corresponding subgroups of
the Clifford group without loss of optimality. This ``strong symmetry
reduction'' drastically reduces computational cost, enabling optimal
decompositions of unitaries on up to seven qubits using a standard laptop--far
beyond previous two-qubit limits. Additionally, we employ a ``weak symmetry
reduction'' method that leverages additional invariances to shrink the search
space further. Applying these results, we demonstrate exponential runtime
improvements in classical simulations of quantum Fourier transform circuits and
measurement-based quantum computations on the Union Jack lattice, as well as
new insights into the non-stabilizer properties of multi-controlled-phase gates
and unitaries generating hypergraph states. Our findings establish symmetry
exploitation as a powerful route to scale classical simulation techniques and
deepen the resource-theoretic understanding of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Intrinsic noise in pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices poses a major challenge

simulations. To address this, we present a method for simulating open quantum
system dynamics on a quantum computer, including negative dissipation rates in
the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. Our approach
lies beyond the standard Markovian approximation, enabling the controlled study
of non-Markovian processes within a quantum simulation framework. Using this
method, we develop a quantum algorithm for calculating ground-state properties
that exploits feedback-controlled, noise-assisted dynamics. In this scheme,
Lyapunov-based feedback steers the system toward a target virtual state under
engineered noise conditions. This framework offers a promising strategy for
harnessing current quantum hardware and advancing robust control protocols
based on open system dynamics.

Abstract: Engineering quantum resources that survive against environmental temperature
is of great interest for modern quantum technologies. However, it is a tricky
task to synthetize such quantum states. Here, we propose a scheme to generate
highly resilient tripartite entanglement and quantum coherence against thermal
fluctuations. Our benchmark model consists of a mechanical resonator driven by
two electromagnetic fields, which are optically coupled. A modulated photon
hopping $J$ captures the optical coupling, and each optical cavity hosts
saturable gain or loss. When the saturable gain/loss are off, we observe a
slightly enhancement of both tripartite entanglement and quantum coherence for
an appropriate tuning of the phase modulation. When the saturation effects are
turned on, we observe a significant enhancement of the tripartite entanglement,
up to one order of magnitude, together with a moderate improvement of the
quantum coherence. More interestingly, our results show that the threshold
thermal phonon mumber for preserving tripartite entanglement in our proposal
has been postponed up to two order of magnitude stronger than when the
saturation effects are not accounted. The inclusion of saturable gain/loss in
our proposal induces noise-tolerant quantum resources, and may lead to room
temperature quantum applications such as quantum information processing, and
quantum computional tasks. Our findings are quite general, and suggest
saturation nonlinear effects as a tool for engineering thermal-immune quantum
correlations.

Abstract: We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a
ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry--P\'erot cavity where
the optical fields carry orbital angular momentum. We first show that the
cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic
modes, whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and
phononlike by detuning sweeps allowing work extraction governed by distinct
reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the
orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios
based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its
ideal-operation value, despite finite-time challenges. Finally, for lower
values of the orbital angular momentum, we describe an alternate scheme for
operating quantum heat engines based on the adiabatic elimination of a
mechanical mode. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as an
experimentally-accessible control knob that can reconfigure the performance of
such quantum heat engines as desired.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of preparing eigenstates for quantum simulations by introducing a fusion method that enhances the Rodeo Algorithm (RA). RA offers exponential convergence but struggles with low overlap between the initial state and the desired eigenstate. The fusion method preconditions the RA state using an adiabatic ramp, which incrementally constructs large systems from smaller, strongly solvable subsystems. This preconditioning improves intermediate state overlaps, allowing RA to maintain exponential convergence even for large systems. Numerical simulations of the spin-1/2 XX model demonstrate that the fusion method provides robust exponential convergence across different system sizes. Compared to using only an adiabatic ramp or the unmodified RA, the fusion method offers computational cost advantages for state preparation precision up to 10⁻³ infidelity or better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum simulation is a rapidly growing field, and the ability to prepare eigenstates of complex quantum systems is crucial for advancing research in this area. Existing methods like the Rodeo Algorithm have shown promise but face limitations, particularly when the initial state has low overlap with the target eigenstate. This paper proposes a fusion method to overcome this limitation and achieve more efficient and reliable eigenstate preparation for large-scale quantum systems.

Method: The paper introduces a fusion method that enhances the Rodeo Algorithm (RA) for eigenstate preparation in quantum simulations. The method involves the following steps: (1) incrementally building large systems from smaller, exactly solvable subsystems, (2) using an adiabatic ramp to precondition the RA state, and (3) ensuring that the RA retains its exponential convergence even for large systems by improving intermediate state overlaps. Numerical simulations of the spin-1/2 XX model are used to validate the method and demonstrate its effectiveness.

Result: The fusion method significantly improves the efficiency and reliability of eigenstate preparation in quantum simulations. The numerical simulations of the spin-1/2 XX model show that the fusion method enables the Rodeo Algorithm to achieve robust exponential convergence across different system sizes. Compared to using only an adiabatic ramp or the unmodified RA, the fusion method provides computational cost advantages for state preparation precision up to 10⁻³ infidelity or better.

Conclusion: The fusion method developed in this paper represents a significant advancement in the field of quantum simulation. By enhancing the Rodeo Algorithm (RA), the fusion method addresses a critical limitation of RA and paves the way for more efficient and reliable eigenstate preparation in large-scale quantum systems. The demonstrated computational cost advantages and robust exponential convergence across system sizes make this approach particularly promising for practical applications in quantum simulation.

Abstract: Robust and efficient eigenstate preparation is a central challenge in quantum
simulation. The Rodeo Algorithm (RA) offers exponential convergence to a target
eigenstate but suffers from poor performance when the initial state has low
overlap with the desired eigenstate, hindering the applicability of the
original algorithm to larger systems. In this work, we introduce a fusion
method that preconditions the RA state by an adiabatic ramp to overcome this
limitation. By incrementally building up large systems from exactly solvable
subsystems and using adiabatic preconditioning to enhance intermediate state
overlaps, we ensure that the RA retains its exponential convergence even in
large-scale systems. We demonstrate this hybrid approach using numerical
simulations of the spin- 1/2 XX model and find that the Rodeo Algorithm
exhibits robust exponential convergence across system sizes. We benchmark
against using only an adiabatic ramp as well as using the unmodified RA,
finding that for state preparation precision at the level of $10^{-3}$
infidelity or better there a decisive computational cost advantage to the
fusion method. These results together demonstrate the scalability and
effectiveness of the fusion method for practical quantum simulations.

Abstract: Intense light-matter interaction largely relies on the use of high-power
light sources, creating fields comparable to, or even stronger than, the field
keeping the electrons bound in atoms. Under such conditions, the interaction
induces highly nonlinear processes such as high harmonic generation, in which
the low-frequency photons of a driving laser field are upconverted into
higher-frequency photons. These processes have enabled numerous groundbreaking
advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and they form the
foundation of attosecond science. Until recently, however, such processes were
typically described using semi-classical approximations, since the quantum
properties of the light field were not required to explain the observables.
This has changed in the recent past. Ongoing theoretical and experimental
advances show that fully quantized descriptions of intense light-matter
interactions, which explicitly incorporate the quantum nature of the light
field, open new avenues for both fundamental research and technological
applications at the fully quantized level. These advances emerge from the
convergence of quantum optics with strong-field physics and ultrafast science.
Together, they have given rise to the field of quantum optics and quantum
electrodynamics of strong-field processes.

*Michał Szczepanik,Ákos Nagy,Emil Żak*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A novel quantum algorithm for simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians on fault-tolerant quantum processors with significant resource reductions compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians is vital for studying molecular vibrations and rotational states in quantum chemistry and spectroscopy, which has broad applications in fields such as biochemistry and materials science.

Method: The method integrates exact curvilinear kinetic energy operators and hybrid finite-basis/discrete-variable potential energy surfaces into a quantum circuit utilizing a Walsh--Hadamard transform-based quantum read-only memory. This approach enables high-precision quantum phase estimation for rovibrational energy levels.

Result: The algorithm offers exponential reductions in logical-qubit count and T-gate complexity relative to block-encoding techniques. For example, computing the rovibrational spectrum of water requires only 10^5 logical qubits compared to other methods, and using 300 qubits yields at least a 10^6 times reduction. Furthermore, it achieves spectroscopic accuracy in energy level estimation for a 30-dimensional system in about three months on a 1 MHz quantum processor, while the best classical supercomputer would take over 30,000 years.

Conclusion: This breakthrough quantum algorithm significantly outperforms current classical methods for simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians, especially in higher-dimensional systems and complex potential scenarios, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in advancing molecular spectroscopy.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians on
fault-tolerant quantum computers. The method integrates exact curvilinear
kinetic energy operators and general-form potential energy surfaces expressed
in a hybrid finite-basis/discrete-variable representation. The Hamiltonian is
encoded as a unitary quantum circuit using a quantum read-only memory
construction based on the Walsh--Hadamard transform, enabling high-accuracy
quantum phase estimation of rovibrational energy levels. Our technique provides
asymptotic reductions in both logical-qubit count and T-gate complexity that
are exponential in the number of atoms and at least polynomial in the total
Hilbert-space size, relative to existing block-encoding techniques based on
linear combinations of unitaries. Compared with classical variational methods,
it offers exponential memory savings and polynomial reductions in time
complexity. The quantum volume required for computing the rovibrational
spectrum of water can be reduced by up to $10^{5}$ times compared with other
quantum methods, increasing to at least $10^{6}$ for a 30-dimensional (12-atom)
model system. For this case with a six-body coupled potential, estimating
spectroscopic-accuracy energy levels would require about three months on a
$1~\mathrm{MHz}$ fault-tolerant quantum processor with fewer than 300 logical
qubits, versus over 30,000 years on the fastest current classical
supercomputer. These estimates are approximate and subject to technological
uncertainties, and realizing the asymptotic advantage will require substantial
quantum resources and continued algorithmic progress.

Abstract: As quantum technologies advance, a fundamental challenge is mitigating noise
and backscattering in superconducting circuits to achieve scalable,
high-fidelity operations. Conventional superconducting components lack
directionality, causing energy loss and decoherence. Superconducting diodes,
that allow dissipationless current in one direction and resistive flow in the
other, offer a potential remedy, yet their efficiency and quantum integration
remain limited. Here, we realize a quantum diode in twisted NbSe2 bilayers
under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A mere 1 degree twist yields
an efficiency enhancement over pristine devices, reaching 27.6 percent. Quantum
simulations reveal that this intermediate efficiency, well below 100 percent
ideal, is both experimentally practical and optimal for preserving qubit
anharmonicity and stabilizing two-level systems. These findings show that
maximal rectification is not always beneficial for quantum information,
establishing a new principle for designing the fundamental properties of
twisted superconductors towards low-power, high-fidelity quantum circuits.

TL;DR: This paper investigates methods to suppress local field noise in quantum annealing protocols by applying dynamical decoupling pulses.

Motivation: Improving the performance of quantum annealing machines is crucial for practical applications in various fields such as optimization and tracking.

Method: The authors propose applying periodic dynamical decoupling pulses to suppress local field noise. They construct QUBO instances with different qubit counts and simulate annealing on a trapped-ion platform.

Result: The results demonstrate that dynamical decoupling can effectively mitigate the effects of environmental noise, improving the fidelity of quantum annealing processes. Scaling behaviors are identified, showing improvements in performance across different system sizes.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical approach to enhance the reliability of quantum annealing machines, offering a promising strategy for error mitigation in near-term quantum implementations.

Abstract: Quantum annealing is a framework for solving combinatorial optimization
problems. While it offers a promising path towards a practical application of
quantum hardware, its performance in real-world devices is severely limited by
environmental noise that can degrade solution quality. We investigate the
suppression of local field noise in quantum annealing protocols through the
periodic application of dynamical decoupling pulses implementing global spin
flips. As test problems, we construct minimal Multiple Object Tracking QUBO
instances requiring only five and nine qubits, as well as cutting stock
instances of five and six qubits. To further place our results in a practical
context, we consider a trapped-ion platform based on magnetic gradient-induced
coupling as a reference architecture, using it to define experimentally
realistic noise and coupling parameters. We show that external magnetic field
fluctuations, typical in such setups, significantly degrade annealing fidelity,
while moderate dynamical decoupling pulse rates, which are achievable in
current experiments, restore performance to near-ideal levels. Our analytical
and numerical results reveal a universal scaling behavior, with fidelity
determined by a generalized parameter combining noise amplitude and dynamical
decoupling pulse interval. While our analysis is grounded in the trapped-ion
platform, the proposed noise mitigation strategy and resulting performance
improvements are applicable to a broad range of quantum annealing
implementations and establish a practical and scalable route for error
mitigation in near-term devices.

dynamically optimize the superposition of noisy paths across multiple nodes to
establish high-fidelity connections between different parties. Our framework
acts as a black box, capable of adapting to unknown noise without requiring
characterization or benchmarking of the corresponding quantum channels. We also
discuss the role of vacuum coherence, a quantum effect central to path
superposition that impacts protocol performance. Additionally, we demonstrate
that our approach remains beneficial even in the presence of imperfections in
the generation of path superposition.

Conclusion: This paper simplifies the proof of the pinching inequality and broadens its applicability in quantum information theory.

Abstract: Hayashi's Pinching Inequality, which establishes a matrix inequality between
a semidefinite matrix and a multiple of its "pinched" version via a projective
measurement, has found many applications in quantum information theory and
beyond. Here, we show a very simple proof of it, which lends itself immediately
to natural generalisations where the different projections of the measurement
have different weights, and where the matrix inequality can be reversed. As an
application we show how the generalised pinching inequality in the case of
binary measurements gives rise to a novel gentle measurement lemma, where
matrix ordering replaces approximation in trace norm.

parameters under the global unitary constraint. As a representative
application, we consider the non-unitary propagator of a Lindbladian
superoperator acting on the vectorized density matrix, which is relevant for
simulating open quantum systems. We further validate the approach
experimentally on superconducting devices in the Quafu quantum cloud computing
cluster. Compared with standard dilation protocols, our method significantly
reduces quantum resource requirements and improves robustness against device
noise, achieving high-fidelity simulation. Its generality also enables
compatibility with non-Markovian dynamics and Kraus-operator-based evolutions,
providing a practical pathway for the noise-resilient simulation of non-unitary

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver to address the
computational challenges of simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body
systems, where the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and extensive
entanglement render classical methods intractable. Our approach combines
real-space sampling of tensor-network-bridged quantum circuits with symmetric
subspace measurements, effectively constraining the wavefunction within a
substaintially reduced Hilbert space for efficient and scalable simulations of
versatile target states. The system is partitioned into equal-sized subsystems,
where quantum circuits capture local entanglement and tensor networks reconnect
them to recover global correlations, thereby overcoming partition-induced
limitations. Symmetric subspace measurements exploit point-group symmetries
through a many-to-one mapping that aggregates equivalent real-space
configurations into a single symmetric state, effectively enhancing real-space
bipartition entanglement while elimilating redundant degrees of freedom. The
tensor network further extends this connectivity across circuits, restoring
global entanglement and correlation, while simultaneously enabling generative
sampling for efficient optimization. As a proof of concept, we apply the method
to the periodic $J_1\!-\!J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one and two
dimensions, incorporating translation, reflection, and inversion symmetries.
With a small matrix product state bond dimension of up to 6, the method
achieves an absolute energy error of $10^{-5}$ for a 64-site periodic chain and
a $6\times6$ torus after bond-dimension extrapolation. These results validate
the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid eigensolver and demonstrate its
strong potential for scalable quantum simulations of strongly correlated
systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores waveguide quantum electrodynamics (WQED) in two dimensions, focusing on photonic scattering phenomena. They develop a scattering theory based on Green's functions and demonstrate the quantum Goos-Hänchen (QGH) shift in photon scattering. For off-centered injection, the QGH shift is enhanced in backward scattering under resonant conditions with subradiant states. In symmetric structures, no QGH shift occurs when photons are injected from the center port. For multiple-port injection, the QGH shift depends on the photon's frequency and transverse momentum. The work provides a framework for manipulating photonic scattering in complex WQED networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of two-dimensional WQED is motivated by the potential for novel quantum phenomena and applications in quantum technologies. The paper addresses the gap in understanding beyond one-dimensional studies.

Method: The authors use the Green function method to develop a scattering theory and analyze different photonic injection scenarios to observe the QGH shift.

Result: They demonstrate that the QGH shift can be enhanced under specific conditions and dependent on photon frequency and injection point. The QGH shift is also shown to be tunable, offering potential for applications in quantum optics and photonics.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive framework for exploring and manipulating photonic scattering in 2D WQED, paving the way for new quantum technologies.

Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to traveling photons in waveguides, known as
waveguide quantum electrodynamics (WQED), offer a powerful platform for
understanding light-matter interactions and underpinning emergent quantum
technologies. While WQED has been extensively studied in one dimension,
two-dimensional (2D) WQED remains largely unexplored, where novel photonic
scattering phenomena unique to higher dimensions are expected. Here, we present
a comprehensive scattering theory for 2D WQED based on the Green function
method. We show that the mean displacement between emitted and injected photons
serves as a quantum analogue of the Goos-H\"anchen shift. When a photon is
injected into a single off-centered port, the quantum Goos-H\"anchen (QGH)
shift can be enhanced in backward scattering under resonant conditions with
subradiant states. When a photon is injected into the center port, there is no
QGH shift due to the mirror symmetry of structure. However, for multiple-port
injection with transverse momentum, the QGH shift is recovered and proportional
to the derivative of phase with respect to transverse momentum. Unlike the
classical Goos-H\"anchen shift, these effects can be flexibly tuned by the
injected photon's frequency. Our work provides a general framework for
exploring and manipulating photonic scattering in complex WQED networks.

Motivation: Understanding quantum dynamics and computational complexity in deformed theories is key for advancing theoretical physics. Krylov subspace methods offer a promising approach to simplify and analyze such systems.

Method: The study employs Krylov subspace methods in the context of Hamiltonian deformations, deriving expressions for time evolution and complexity. It leverages mathematical tools like tridiagonal generators, Toda equations, and unitary transformations in real and imaginary time.

Result: The method allows for the description of quantum dynamics through Krylov subspaces, revealing structural reorganizations and tractable models from base cases. New dynamics, such as generalized Toda flows, are identified, and applications to thermal systems and random matrices are explored.

Conclusion: The research lays foundation for applying Krylov subspace techniques to explore quantum complexity and dynamics in a broad context, with potential applications in various physical systems.

Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a complex system can be efficiently described in
Krylov space, the minimal subspace in which the dynamics unfolds. We apply the
Krylov subspace method for Hamiltonian deformations, which provides a
systematic way of constructing solvable models from known instances. In doing
so, we relate the evolution of deformed and undeformed theories and investigate
their complexity. For a certain class of deformations, the resulting Krylov
subspace is unchanged, and we observe time evolutions with a reorganized basis.
The tridiagonal form of the generator in the Krylov space is maintained, and we
obtain generalized Toda equations as a function of the deformation parameters.
The imaginary-time-like evolutions can be described by real-time unitary ones.
As possible applications, we discuss coherent Gibbs states for thermodynamic
systems, for which we analyze the survival probability, spread complexity,
Krylov entropy, and associated time-averaged quantities. We further discuss the
statistical properties of random matrices and supersymmetric systems for
quadratic deformations.

Abstract: We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme that is broadly
applicable to quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. The scheme
achieves constant qubit overhead and a time overhead of $O(d^{a+o(1)})$ for any
$[[n,k,d]]$ qLDPC code with constant encoding rate and distance $d =
\Omega(n^{1/a})$. For good qLDPC codes, the time overhead is minimized and
reaches $O(d^{1+o(1)})$. In contrast, code surgery based on gauging measurement
and brute-force branching requires a time overhead of $O(dw^{1+o(1)})$, where
$d\leq w\leq n$. Thus, our scheme is asymptotically faster for all codes with
$a < 2$. This speedup is achieved by developing techniques that enable
parallelized code surgery under constant qubit overhead and leverage classical
locally testable codes for efficient resource state preparation. These results
establish a new paradigm for accelerating fault-tolerant quantum computation on
qLDPC codes, while maintaining low overhead and broad applicability.

min-tradeoff functions via semidefinite programming duality, thus making the
framework suitable for bounding the certifiable randomness against adaptive
attacking strategies through entropy accumulation. Our results establish
sufficient criteria showing that maximum confidence measurements enable the

Conclusion: 该研究通过理论分析和数值模拟，证实了连续监测不会引起自由费米系统中的量相转变。这为理解连续监测的量子效应提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of one-dimensional free fermionic systems can generate
phenomena reminiscent of quantum criticality, such as logarithmic entanglement
growth, algebraic correlations, and emergent conformal invariance, but in a
nonequilibrium setting. However, whether these signatures reflect a genuine
phase of nonequilibrium quantum matter or persist only over finite length
scales is an active area of research. We address this question in a free
fermionic chain subject to continuous monitoring of lattice-site occupations.
An unraveling phase $\varphi$ interpolates between measurement schemes,
corresponding to different stochastic unravelings of the same Lindblad master
equation: For $\varphi = 0$, measurements disentangle lattice sites, while for
$\varphi = \pi/2$ they act as unitary random noise, yielding volume-law
steady-state entanglement. Using replica Keldysh field theory, we obtain a
nonlinear sigma model describing the long-wavelength physics. This analysis
shows that for $0 \leq \varphi < \pi/2$, entanglement ultimately obeys an area
law, but only beyond the exponentially large scale $\ln(l_{\varphi,*}) \sim
J/[\gamma \cos(\varphi)]$, where $J$ is the hopping amplitude and $\gamma$ the
measurement rate. Resolving $l_{\varphi, *}$ in numerical simulations is
difficult for $\gamma/J \to 0$ or $\varphi \to \pi/2$. However, the theory also
predicts that critical-like behavior appears below a crossover scale that grows
only algebraically in $J/\gamma$, making it numerically accessible. Our
simulations confirm these predictions, establishing the absence of measurement-
or unraveling-induced entanglement transitions in this model.

Abstract: Current quantum computers suffer from noise due to lack of error correction.
Several techniques to mitigate the effect of noise have been studied, in
particular to extract the expectation value of observables. One such technique,
circuit cutting, partitions large circuits into smaller, less noisy
subcircuits, but the exponential increase in the number of circuit executions
limits its scalability. Another method, operator backpropagation (OBP) reduces
circuit depth by classically simulating parts of it, yet often escalates the
number of circuit executions by some factor due to additional non-commuting
terms in the updated observable. This paper introduces an optimized approach
for minimizing noise in quantum circuits using operator backpropagation (OBP)
combined with circuit cutting. We demonstrate that the strategic use of OBP
with circuit cutting can mitigate the execution overhead. By employing
simulated annealing, our proposed method identifies the optimal backpropagation
parameter for specific circuits and observables, maximizing resource reduction
in cutting. Results show a 3x and 10x decrease in resource requirements for
Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Hamiltonian simulation circuits
respectively, while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. This approach also
yields similar savings for other circuits from the Benchpress database and
various observable weights, providing an efficient method to lower circuit
cutting overhead without compromising performance.

They perform numerical experiments comparing these methods with Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) as a benchmark.

Result: The proposed methods achieve remarkable accuracy and are found to be a competitive quantum alternative for derivatives valuation.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of quantum machine learning in enhancing traditional financial modeling techniques, offering a promising direction for the future integration of quantum technologies in finance.

Abstract: The ongoing progress in quantum technologies has fueled a sustained
exploration of their potential applications across various domains. One
particularly promising field is quantitative finance, where a central challenge
is the pricing of financial derivatives-traditionally addressed through Monte
Carlo integration techniques. In this work, we introduce two hybrid
classical-quantum methods to address the option pricing problem. These
approaches rely on reconstructing Fourier series representations of statistical
distributions from the outputs of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models based
on Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). We analyze the impact of data size and
PQC dimensionality on performance. Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) is
employed as a benchmark to quantitatively assess the proposed models in terms
of computational cost and accuracy in the extraction of Fourier coefficients.
Through the numerical experiments, we show that the proposed methods achieve
remarkable accuracy, becoming a competitive quantum alternative for derivatives
valuation.

Abstract: We investigate memory effects in non-Markovian dynamics on superconducting
quantum processors provided by IBM Quantum. We use a collision-model approach
to implement suitable single- and two-qubit dynamics with a gate-based quantum
circuit. Coupling the system of interest to an ancilla allows for a
characterization of the process with respect to non-Markovian memory effects in
general, as well as concerning the quantumness of that memory. We demonstrate
that current noisy quantum hardware is capable of verifying quantum memory in
single-qubit dynamics. We then discuss why a generalization of this dynamics to
the two-qubit case cannot directly be simulated in a way that allows quantum
memory to be observed. Nevertheless, we present an alternative toy example that
demonstrates how quantum memory of two-qubit dynamics can be witnessed using
current noisy quantum computers.

Abstract: Quantum-information-inspired experiments in nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy may yield a pathway towards determining molecular structure and
properties that are otherwise challenging to learn. We measure
out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) [1-4] on two organic molecules
suspended in a nematic liquid crystal, and investigate the utility of this data
in performing structural learning tasks. We use OTOC measurements to augment
molecular dynamics models, and to correct for known approximations in the
underlying force fields. We demonstrate the utility of OTOCs in these models by
estimating the mean ortho-meta H-H distance of toluene and the mean dihedral
angle of 3',5'-dimethylbiphenyl, achieving similar accuracy and precision to
independent spectroscopic measurements of both quantities. To ameliorate the
apparent exponential classical cost of interpreting the above OTOC data, we
simulate the molecular OTOCs on a Willow superconducting quantum processor,
using AlphaEvolve-optimized [5] quantum circuits and arbitrary-angle fermionic
simulation gates. We implement novel zero-noise extrapolation techniques based
on the Pauli pathing model of operator dynamics [6], to repeat the learning
experiments with root-mean-square error $0.05$ over all circuits used. Our work
highlights a computational protocol to interpret many-body echoes from nuclear
magnetic systems using low resource quantum computation.

Abstract: We demonstrate that an all-to-all coupled spin-chain model of a quantum
battery with 2-local interactions exhibits superextensive charging when
analysed using the upper bound derived from the uncertainty principle. Unlike
the previously studied models in the literature, the contribution to this
apparent quantum advantage arises from both the battery and the charger, and it
does not require long-range couplings. However, on closer analysis of the
charging using the battery evolution in the energy eigenspace, the advantage
vanishes. Moreover, this tighter bound can also fail in certain physical
situations. One has to exercise caution and compute the actual power
transferred before claiming a quantum advantage.

Abstract: Spin defects in diamond serve as powerful building blocks for quantum
technologies, especially for applications in quantum sensing and quantum
networks. Electron-nuclear defects formed in the environment of optically
active spins, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, can be harnessed as
qubits to construct larger hybrid quantum registers. However, many of these
defects have yet to be characterized, limiting their integration into scalable
devices. Here, we introduce an approach to identify the hyperfine components
and nuclear spin species of spin defects through measurements on a nearby NV
center. This approach combines double electron-electron resonance performed at
zero field (ZF-DEER) with nuclear-electron-electron triple resonance (NEETR),
which we use to characterize two unknown defects at the single-spin level,
yielding self-consistent results. These results provide a guide to resolving
the defect structures using $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations, leading to the
identification of a new hydrogen defect structure and an accurate match to a
previously identified nitrogen defect. Building on the NEETR protocol, we then
demonstrate initialization, unitary control, and long-lived coherence of the
nuclear spin qubit of the hydrogen defect with $T_2 = 1.0(3)\,\mathrm{ms}$. Our
characterization and control tools establish a framework to expand the
accessible defect landscape for hybrid electron-nuclear registers and enable
applications in quantum sensing, networks, and atomic-scale magnetic resonance
imaging at room temperature.

Abstract: Estimating the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices is a foundational problem
with far-reaching implications, from modeling non-Hermitian quantum systems to
analyzing complex fluid dynamics. Yet, this task remains beyond the reach of
standard quantum algorithms, which are predominantly tailored for Hermitian
matrices. Here we introduce a new class of quantum algorithms that directly
address this challenge. The central idea is to construct eigenvalue signals
through customized quantum simulation protocols and extract them using advanced
classical signal-processing techniques, thereby enabling accurate and efficient
eigenvalue estimation for general non-normal matrices. Crucially, when supplied
with purified quantum state inputs, our algorithms attain Heisenberg-limited
precision--achieving optimal performance. These results extend the powerful
guided local Hamiltonian framework into the non-Hermitian regime, significantly
broadening the frontier of quantum computational advantage. Our work lays the
foundation for a rigorous and scalable quantum computing approach to one of the
most demanding problems in linear algebra.

Abstract: When a metastable state decays into radiation, there must be entanglement
between the radiation and the decaying system, as well as between radiation
collected at late and early times. We study the interplay between these two
types of entanglement in simple Gaussian models. We define, via a windowed
Fourier transform, multimode quantum states associated with radiation fragments
produced at different times and compute the corresponding entanglement entropy
increments. On the basis of these results, we argue that such entropy
increments are useful entanglement measures, especially in cases, such as
Hawking radiation, where one wishes to separate the radiation into ``old'' and
``new.''

Abstract: The spectral properties of positive maps provide pivotal information for
understanding the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with their
environment. Furthermore, central problems in quantum information such as the
characterization of entanglement may be reformulated in terms of spectral
properties of positive maps. The present work aims to contribute to a better
understanding of the spectrum of positive maps. Specifically, our main result
is a new proof of a universal bound on the $d^{2}-1$ generically non vanishing
decay rates $\Gamma_{i}$ of time-autonomous quantum master equations on a
$d$-dimensional Hilbert space: $$
  \Gamma_{\mathrm{max}}\,\leq\,c_{d}\,\sum_{i=1}^{d^{2}-1}\Gamma_{i}
  \nonumber $$ The prefactor $c_{d}$ , which we explicitly determine, depends
only on the dimension $d$ and varies depending on the sub-class of positive
maps to which the semigroup solution of the master equation belongs. We provide
a brief but self-consistent survey of these concepts. We obtain our main result
by resorting to the theory of Lyapunov exponents, a central concept in the
study of dynamical systems, control theory, and out-of-equilibrium statistical
mechanics. We thus show that progress in understanding positive maps in quantum
mechanics may require ideas at the crossroads between different disciplines.
For this reason, we adopt a notation and presentation style aimed at reaching
readers with diverse backgrounds.

Abstract: The unification of gravity and quantum mechanics remains one of the most
profound open questions in science. With recent advances in quantum technology,
an experimental idea first proposed by Richard Feynman is now regarded as a
promising route to testing this unification for the first time. The experiment
involves placing a massive object in a quantum superposition of two locations
and letting it gravitationally interact with another mass. If the two objects
subsequently become entangled, this is considered unambiguous evidence that
gravity obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This conclusion derives from
theorems that treat a classical gravitational interaction as a local
interaction capable of only transmitting classical, not quantum, information.
Here, we extend the description of the gravitational interaction used in these
theorems to the full framework of quantum field theory, finding that theories
with classical gravity can then transmit quantum information, and thus generate
entanglement through physical, local processes. The effect scales differently
to that predicted by theories of quantum gravity, providing information on the
parameters and form of the experiment required to robustly evidence the quantum
nature of gravity.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A paper introduces a method using squeezed states in quantum optical systems to achieve high-quality quantum superpositions with high fidelity through photon subtraction, avoiding restrictions to only cat states. The approach uses displacement encoding for quantum computing and discusses quantum annealing and error correction techniques, leveraging non-Gaussian states to improve parallel processing capabilities in optical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing and optical systems that leverage non-Gaussian states are critical for advancing quantum information processing.

Method: The method involves encoding information using the relative displacement of optical modes, employing photon subtraction protocols on squeezed states. This approach allows for high-fidelity quantum superpositions with moderate squeezing and anti-squeezing, enabling explicit non-Gaussian interference in quantum parallel processing.

Result: The study demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing cat state protocols in creating high-quality quantum superpositions, whereas the presented method avoids restrictions to only cat states. The approach utilizes displacements as a degree of freedom for encoding in quantum parallel processing. The paper also discusses the practical considerations for implementing an optical quantum annealer, such as quantum erasure on loss channels and error correction for unused degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel method using non-Gaussian states for quantum computing and optical systems, along with practical considerations for implementation and future research directions.

Abstract: We introduce an encoding of information in the relative displacement or
photon number of different optical modes. Since the loss rate to interference
is insensitive to squeezing and many non-Gaussian fluctuations, such a space is
relatively protected from imperfections. We show that photon subtraction
protocols can be used to create high-quality quantum superpositions of squeezed
states with much higher fidelity than when the protocol is restricted to
producing only cat states (superpositions of coherent states). We also show
that the amount of squeezing and anti-squeezing introduced is moderate, and
unlikely to dominate the photon number. This parallel processing allows for
explicit use of non-Gaussian interference as opposed to the more incidental
role played by non-Gaussianity in all-optical coherent Ising machines. A key
observation we make is that displacements of optical states provide a
convenient degree of freedom to encode information for quantum parallel
processing. Furthermore, we discuss important considerations for realizing an
optical quantum annealer based on differential photon number encoding. In
particular, we discuss the need to perform quantum erasure on loss channels
from interference, as well as the ability to correct degrees of freedom not
used for the encoding without disrupting the processed quantum information.

TL;DR: Abrikosov vortices, normally suppressing superconducting gaps, act like two-level quantum systems with rapid coherence and energy relaxation times, supporting recent theoretical models. We experimentally demonstrate these vortices using circuit QED techniques in granular aluminum microwave resonators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The article discusses the quantum behavior of vortices in superconductors, which has potential applications in quantum information processing and sensing. The motivation is to explore this quantum behavior and its practical applications.

Method: The research uses circuit quantum electrodynamics to manipulate and read quantum states of vortices in granular superconductors. Experiments are conducted in aluminum microwave resonators to demonstrate coherent manipulation and quantum non-demolition readout of vortex states.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that vortices exhibit quantum coherence and energy relaxation times compatible with quantum information processing. This supports theoretical models predicting quantum behavior at the scale of coherence lengths in granular superconductors.

Conclusion: The findings open new avenues for quantum information processing and sensing by manipulating quantum vortices in superconductors, leveraging their quantum coherence properties.

Abstract: Abrikosov vortices, where the superconducting gap is completely suppressed in
the core, are dissipative, semi-classical entities that impact applications
from high-current-density wires to superconducting quantum devices. In
contrast, we present evidence that vortices trapped in granular superconducting
films can behave as two-level systems, exhibiting microsecond-range quantum
coherence and energy relaxation times that reach fractions of a millisecond.
These findings support recent theoretical modeling of superconductors with
granularity on the scale of the coherence length as tunnel junction networks,
resulting in gapped vortices. Using the tools of circuit quantum
electrodynamics, we perform coherent manipulation and quantum non-demolition
readout of vortex states in granular aluminum microwave resonators, heralding
new directions for quantum information processing, materials characterization,
and sensing.

Abstract: Physical qubits in a quantum computer are often represented by superposition
states of single particles or excitations. Decay of the excitation itself is a
fundamental error channel that is difficult to overcome via external drive or
control techniques. Quantum error correcting codes, which encode information in
superpositions involving multiple excitations, provide a path to preserve
information beyond the capacity of individual excitations, but typically
require exquisite active operations on the system. Here, we demonstrate a
steady-state driven dissipative quantum system, composed of a superconducting
cavity and a transmon ancilla, that preserves a logical qubit beyond the
photon-lifetime limit by about 5% using a binomial encoding. This realization
of continuous quantum error correction at the breakeven point highlights the
quantitative competitiveness of passive correction strategies while
circumventing some demanding hardware requirements of its active counterparts.

Motivation: 量子纠错码在量子计算中扮演着关键角色，尤其是在实现复杂量子操作时，能够并行执行多个操作将极大地提升效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建高效量子误差校正码提供了新的思路，特别是对于并行执行多个复杂量子操作具有重要意义。

Abstract: We revisit a family of good quantum error-correcting codes presented in He
$\textit{et al.}$ (2025), and we show that various sets of addressable and
transversal non-Clifford multi-control-$Z$ gates can be performed in parallel.
The construction relies on the good classical codes of Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans.
Inf. Theory, 2006), which were previously instantiated in He $\textit{et al.}$
(2025), to yield quantum CSS codes over which addressable logical
$\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates can be performed at least one at a time. Here, we show
that for any $m$, there exists a family of good quantum error-correcting codes
over qudits for which logical $\mathsf{C}^{m}\mathsf{Z}$ gates can address
specific logical qudits and be performed in parallel. This leads to a
significant advantage in the depth overhead of multi-control-$Z$ circuits.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the maximum work extractable from a quantum battery, influenced by its topology and chirality, showing how these factors can optimize energy storage and enhance robustness against decoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limits of energy extraction from quantum systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, particularly in the realm of quantum batteries.

Method: The researchers employ quantum walks to analyze the impact of topology and chirality on battery performance. They examine ring, complete, and wheel graph structures and assess their behavior under noise.

Result: The study reveals that topology and chirality can significantly affect the system's ergotropy. Chirality enhances ergotropy in complete graphs and optimizes performance in ring structures by bridging the gap between odd and even configurations. Degeneracy from chirality can improve robustness against pure dephasing.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that topology and chirality are key resources in optimizing quantum energy devices, offering design guidelines for efficient and robust quantum batteries.

Abstract: The maximum work that can be extracted from a quantum battery is bounded by
the ergotropy of the system, which is determined by the spectral properties of
the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we employ the formalism of quantum walks to
investigate how the topology of the battery and the chirality of the
Hamiltonian influence its performance as an energy storage unit. We analyze
architectures of battery cells based on ring, complete, and wheel graph
structures and analyze their behavior in the presence of noise. Our results
show that these structures exhibit distinct ergotropy scaling, with the
interplay between chirality and topology providing a tunable mechanism to
optimize work extraction and enhance robustness against decoherence. In
particular, chirality enhances ergotropy for complete quantum cells, without
altering the linear scaling with size, whereas in ring cells, it bridges the
performance gap between configurations with odd and even number of units.
Additionaly, chirality may be exploited to force degeneracies in the
Hamiltonian, a condition that can spare the ergotropy to vanish in the presence
of pure dephasing. We conclude that topology and chirality are key resources
for improving ergotropy, offering guidelines to optimize quantum energy devices
and protocols.

Motivation: 随着量子计算和信息处理技术的发展，精确操控单个原子变得至关重要，该平台提供了必要的工具和技术。

Method: 通过蓝色磁光捕获器将大约$4	imes 10^6$个$^{88}$Sr原子冷却到8 mK，随后使用窄线红色磁光捕获器将$4	imes 10^5$个原子冷却到5 uK，并达到$10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$的高密度。加载到813 nm的光镊子阵列后，利用高数值孔径物镜聚焦，并通过光协助碰撞过程实现了单一原子占据。

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一个稳定可靠的$^{88}$Sr光镊子平台，整合了高效的加载、冷却和高精度检测，为未来量子模拟和量子信息处理提供了关键的基础。

Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating
individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on
a blue magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$
transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a
temperature of 8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using
the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times
10^5$ atoms down to 5 uK and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$.
Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed
acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a
high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes
we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with
a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence
imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival
probability of $97(1)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a
temperature of $12.92(5)$ uK for the atoms in the tweezers, and the
ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes.
These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that
combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the
essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum
information processing with Sr atoms.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern mechanical sensors increasingly measure motion with precision
sufficient to resolve the fundamental thermal noise floor over a broad band.
Compared to traditional sensors -- achieving this limit only near resonance --
this capability provides massive gains in acquisition rates along with access
to otherwise obscured transient signals. However, these stronger measurements
of motion are naturally accompanied by increased back-action. Here we show how
resolving the broadband thermal noise spectrum reveals back-action-induced
correlations in the noise from many mechanical modes, even those well-separated
in frequency. As a result, the observed spectra can deviate significantly from
predictions of the usual single-mode and (uncorrelated) multimode models over
the broad band, notably even at the mechanical resonance peaks. This highlights
that these effects must be considered in all systems exhibiting measurement
back-action, regardless of whether the resonances are spectrally isolated or
the readout noise is high enough that the noise peaks appear consistent with
simpler models. Additionally, these correlations advantageously allow the
thermal noise spectrum to reach a minimum -- equivalent to that of a single
mode -- in a band far from the resonance peak, where the mechanical
susceptibility is comparatively stable against frequency noise.

Abstract: Local intensity enhancement by plasmonic nanoparticles is widely used in
optics and photonics. However, the effect is usually based on dipole resonances
in the particles. Recently, it has been shown that quadrupole and octupole
resonances can exhibit comparable, or even higher near-field enhancement. In
this work, we focus on the near-field enhancement by a metasurface composed of
gold-disc dimers arranged in a rectangular array. We find that, owing to an
octupole plasmon resonance coupled to a surface lattice resonance,
exceptionally high near-field enhancement in the dimer gaps can be achieved in
the visible spectral range. To gain insight into the effect, we develop an
analytical model for the effective dipole and octupole polarizabilities of the
particles in an array, and discover, that at decreasing array periods, the
dipole polarizability tends to vanish, while the octupole polarizability
rapidly increases. Hence, octupole resonances can find applications in
high-density arrays of plasmonic resonators. We propose a method to numerically
evaluate multipole polarizabilities of a single particle, applying it to the
gold dimer that we consider. The influence of the array on the effective
polarizabilities is then verified by numerical calculations and a good
agreement is obtained. Our results may open new avenues for investigating the
properties of periodic plasmonic structures based on higher-order multipole
resonances and their applications.

Abstract: Glass materials play an increasingly important role in advanced technologies
due to their superior physical properties. However, precise machining of glass
remains a major challenge because of its brittleness and sensitivity to thermal
and mechanical stresses. In this study, we present a novel approach that
combines spherical-aberration-assisted filamentation with Laser-Induced Deep
Etching (LIDE) to achieve unprecedented high-precision micro-hole machining in
fused silica substrates. By deliberately introducing spherical aberration into
an intense femtosecond laser beam, thin, uniformly elongated, and stable
filaments are generated, which effectively suppress unwanted plasma formation
and thermal deformation typical of standard filamentation. Using this method,
we fabricated micro-holes with diameters as small as 10 $\mu$m across various
sizes, maintaining an almost zero taper even in 1 mm-thick samples. The
sidewalls exhibited nanoscale smoothness (Ra = 38.1 nm, RMS = 53.9 nm), and the
hole area demonstrated excellent repeatability with only \sim 1.0\% variation
across multiple trials. This simple optical configuration drastically reduces
cost compared with existing approaches that rely on specialized components,
while moderately satisfying critical requirements for geometrical versatility,
minimal damage, precision, and repeatability. This work represents a
significant step forward in precision glass machining and lays a foundation for
future microstructured electronic, optical, and microfluidic devices.

Abstract: Fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) are widely used in optical sensing and
communication systems. Femtosecond laser inscription (FLI) enables
hydrogen-free, thermally stable, high-resolution, and complex structures of FBG
fabrication, but its practical application is limited by manual operation, low
throughput, and sensitivity to laser alignment. In this study, we present an
AI-powered FLI system that enables automated, stable, and efficient FBG
fabrication. By integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for real-time
fabrication position correction, the system maintains precise laser alignment
(-0.6 to 0.2 microns of the fibre core plane) and ensures consistent
processing. Strong and weak FBGs were fabricated in different types of fibres,
and their spectral characteristics-including central wavelength, reflectivity,
and FWHM-exhibited high stability and repeatability. The results demonstrate
that the proposed AI-powered FLI system significantly reduces manual
intervention while achieving reliable FBG performance. This approach holds
great promise for scalable, high-throughput FBG production and can be extended
to the fabrication of arbitrary FBG structures across various fibre types. With
further training and model refinement, the AI-powered FLI provides a scalable
and intelligent platform for next-generation automated FBG manufacturing.

Abstract: We demonstrate detuning-tunable generation of orbital-angular-momentum (OAM)
light using a double Lambda four-wave-mixing (FWM) process in Doppler broadened
rubidium vapor. Two near-resonant pumps on the D1 line drive non degenerate FWM
that produces bright probe conjugate beams whose transverse modes evolve with
pump detuning. A paraxial density-matrix model coupled to split-step
propagation predicts detuning-dependent spatial gain shaping that sets the OAM
content; experiments with a mode cleaned pump laser and a 12-mm AR-coated vapor
cell validate these predictions. We quantify mode formation by imaging,

generated beams. The results establish resonant atomic vapor as a compact,

Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with

electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations
and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for
the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a
generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the
transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion
channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal
fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of
thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale
heat transfer.

*Alexander Mrokon,Till Wachweger,Dongsung Shin,Karsten Buse,Ingo Breunig*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: When adiabatic frequency conversion is applied to a millimeter-sized lithium niobate whispering gallery resonator with a strong mechanical resonance at 10.5 MHz, the typical linear relationship between the control signal and optical frequency shifts is disrupted, even when higher-order harmonic signals align with the resonance. This demonstrates that mechanical resonances inherently limit the linearity of adiabatic frequency conversion and its applications in optical control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limitations of adiabatic frequency conversion is crucial for optimizing optical frequency tuning in micro and nanoscale devices, such as whispering gallery resonators, which are critical in precision metrology and optical signal processing.

Method: The researchers used a millimeter-sized lithium niobate whispering gallery resonator and applied a controlled sinusoidal voltage to induce frequency shifts. They measured the optical frequencies resulting from different control signals, both above and below the mechanical resonance frequency of 10.5 MHz.

Result: The experimental results revealed that near the mechanical resonance frequency, the relationship between the control signal and the optical frequency shift became non-linear, even when higher-order harmonics of the control signal coincided with the mechanical resonance.

Conclusion: This finding indicates that mechanical resonances impose fundamental limits on the linearity of adiabatic frequency conversion, necessitating the development of alternative strategies to enhance the linearity of optical frequency control in such systems.

Abstract: Adiabatic frequency conversion enables fast and efficient tuning of laser
light by coupling it into an optical resonator whose eigenfrequency is varied
on a timescale shorter than its photon lifetime. In this regime, the optical
frequency follows the cavity resonance, allowing frequency shifts of several
hundred gigahertz within sub-microsecond time - independent of optical power
and without phase-matching constraints. While a linear dependence of the cavity
resonance on a control parameter (e.g., applied voltage) suggests that
arbitrary temporal signals could be linearly transferred to optical frequency
changes, we show that this assumption fails near mechanical resonances of the
resonator. Using a millimeter-sized lithium niobate whispering gallery
resonator with a pronounced mechanical mode at 10.5 MHz, we observe strong
deviations from linearity even when higher harmonics of the control signal
coincide with this resonance. The experimental results are in excellent
agreement with theoretical predictions. They demonstrate that mechanical
resonances impose intrinsic limits on the linearity of adiabatic frequency
conversion and other frequency control schemes based on the variation of the
eigenfrequency of an optical cavity.

Abstract: High-power laser technologies are critical in precision manufacturing,
defense, and scientific research, where accurate control over the beam profile
is essential. To address this need, we employ coherent beam combining (CBC)
through adaptive phase control to precisely craft far-field intensity
distributions. We present a comprehensive framework comprising two
complementary strategies: (i) dynamic beam shaping through sequential steering,
enabling programmable trajectories and arbitrary patterns for versatile energy
delivery, and (ii) static shaping via iterative phase optimization, producing
target defined profiles such as rings, squares, and triangles. Rapid
reconfiguration of beam profiles and steering is achieved through optimized
phase-control algorithms. Among the tested methods, a deep-learning-inspired
Adagrad optimization approach demonstrated the fastest and most stable
convergence, ensuring scalability and robustness. The proposed strategy
significantly enhances power delivery efficiency and beam uniformity compared
to conventional shaping techniques. This dual-mode CBC framework establishes a
versatile and resilient platform for adaptive laser beam control, with
transformative potential across industrial manufacturing, materials processing,
medical systems, directed-energy applications, and tunable light-field

Abstract: Understanding specific ion adsorption within the inner Helmholtz layer
remains central to electrochemistry yet experimentally elusive. Here we
directly quantify counterion adsorption and extract the associated
thermodynamic parameters within the inner Helmholtz layer using phase-sensitive
sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (PS-SFVS). Using sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) as a model ionic surfactant, we determine the Na+ and DS- surface
densities by simultaneously analyzing interfacial free OH response and the
diffuse-layer SF signal, from which the adsorption thermodynamic parameters are
derived. We then construct an adsorption phase diagram that maps the evolution
of Na+ and DS- species in the compact layer as functions of bulk NaCl and SDS
concentrations, revealing a continuous increase in surface ion pairing. The
DS-: Na+ pairing ratio gradually decreases with increasing NaCl and approaches
2.8 at the supersaturation state prior to surface nucleation. These results
establish PS-SFVS as a quantitative probe of ion-headgroup correlations in
charged interfaces and reveal the thermodynamic mechanism underlying
counterion-mediated interfacial ordering, with broad implications for
electrolyte design, biomembrane stability, and soft-matter assembly.

Abstract: A systematic analysis of the Eckhaus instability in the one-dimensional
Ginzburg-Landau equation is presented. The analysis is based on numerical
integration of the equation in a large (xt)-domain. The initial conditions
correspond to a stationary, unstable spatially periodic solution perturbed by
"noise." The latter consists of a set of spatially periodic modes with small
amplitudes and random phases. The evolution of the solution is examined by
analyzing and comparing the dynamics of three key characteristics: the solution
itself, its spatial spectrum, and the value of the Lyapunov functional. All
calculations exhibit four distinct, mutually agreed, well-defined regimes: (i)
rapid decay of stable perturbations; (ii) latent changes, when the solution and
the Lyapunov functional undergo minimal alterations while the Fourier spectrum
concentrates around the most unstable perturbations; (iii) a phase-slip period,
characterized by a sharp decrease in the Lyapunov functional; (iv) slow
relaxation to a final stable state.

Abstract: The development of uniform GaN micro-pyramids and platelets via selective
area growth is a critical step toward advancing III-nitride device
technologies, particularly for micro-light-emitting diode applications. This
work investigates the origins of morphological non-uniformity in micro-pyramids
and micro-platelets grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
We observe that a direct one-step growth approach leads to significant growth
rate inhomogeneity across arrays. To shed light on this issue, we examine the
mechanisms driving non-uniformity and explore process modifications aimed at
mitigating these effects. Building on these insights, we propose a controlled
multi-step growth strategy that combines sequen-tial growth and thermal
treatment phases. This approach is demonstrated to enhance surface morphology
and structural regularity. The work contributes to the broader objective of
enabling scalable, high-precision GaN microstructure fabrication for
next-generation optoelectronic applications.

Conclusion: 综合实验和数值模拟的结果，可以得出加入 S-S 磁PCM 的 Empty bricks 拥有显著的热惯性，有效减少室内温度高峰，进而降低建筑能耗，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: This work is an experimental and numerical study of the thermal performance
of building envelope structures incorporating a solid-solid phase change
material (S-S PCM), consisting in a cross-linked polyurethane designated as
PUX-1500-20. This S-S PCM is capable of storing and releasing thermal energy
via phase transitions within the human comfort temperature range, facilitating
the temporal and spatial transfer of solar energy for optimizing energy
efficiency. The primary aim of this work is to integrate the S-S PCM into
hollow bricks used in building envelopes and to evaluate their thermal inertia
through both experimental testing and numerical simulation. The experimental
results demonstrate that the integration of the PCM effectively delays and
decreases the indoor temperature peak. The simulation results also show that
the incorporation of the S-S PCM into hollow bricks gives rise to a phase shift
of 7 hours and a decrement factor of 0.38. In comparison with the thermal
behavior of the building envelopes (hollow brick) without PCMs, our results
provide convincing evidence of the important thermal inertia of these
structures incorporating the PCMs, revealing their significant potential in
reducing energy consumption of building.

Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas offer new avenues to manipulate the propagation of
light in materials due to their near field enhancement and ultrafast response
time. Here we investigate the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) response in an L-shaped
nanoantenna structure under the phenomenon of plasmonic analog of enhancement
in the index of refraction. Using a quantum mechanical approach, we analyze the
modulation in the response of probe field and emergence of ENZ frequency region
both in the linear and nonlinear plasmonic system. We also demonstrate the
active tuning of ENZ frequency region in a nanoantenna structure by modulating
the phase of control pulse. The analytical and 3D FDTD simulation results show
a significant spectral shift in the ENZ modes. Our proposed method offers the
possibility to design and control optical tunable ENZ response in plasmonic
metasurfaces without the use of ENZ material. Such metasurfaces can be used in
on-chip photonic integrated circuits, further localization of incident fields,
slow light operations and various quantum technologies.

Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) with coupled resonators offers a promising
solution for the seamless powering of electronic devices. Interactive design
approaches that visualize the magnetic field and power transfer efficiency
based on system geometry adjustments can facilitate the understanding and
exploration of the behavior of these systems for dynamic applications. However,
typical electromagnetic field simulation methods, such as the Method of Moments
(MoM), require significant computational resources, limiting the rate at which
computation can be performed for acceptable interactivity. Furthermore, the
system's sensitivity to positional and geometrical changes necessitates a large
number of simulations, and structures such as ferromagnetic shields further
complicate these simulations. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach
using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), demonstrating for the first time the
rapid estimation of the entire magnetic field and power transfer efficiency for
near-field coupled systems. To achieve quick and accurate estimation, we
develop 3D adaptive grid systems and an active learning strategy to effectively
capture the nonlinear interactions between complex system geometries and
magnetic fields. By training a regression model, our approach achieves magnetic
field computation with sub-second latency and with an average error of less
than 6% when validated against independent electromagnetic simulation results.

Motivation: 随着量子光学和光子学的快速发展，如何调控量子发泡的发射特性能成为关键挑战，该研究旨在通过材料和相互作用的工程化实现这一目标。

Method: 研究采用了一个包含量子点的石墨烯球形壳结构，在强耦合条件下，利用 TEAM 模式（石墨烯的 plasmons 和 QD 的 excitation modes）来可调地改变光子晶体的局部光响应。通过电压偏置调节模式，使用 3D Maxwell 方程的数值求解工具（MNPBEM）来验证系统的动态行为。

Result: 研究结果表明，通过这种设计，可以实现对量子点发射率的动态调节，使发射率从近红外到远红外范围显著增强或抑制。此外，TEAM 模式的宽度显著优于孤立的石墨烯 plasmons，这表明系统在调谐波长处具有更高的灵敏度。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种基于光子晶体和量子点相互作用的灵活平台，可用于编程控制量子发泡的发射特性，为可重新配置的光子器件开发奠定了基础，如单光子源和超快光学开关。

Abstract: Active control of the radiative properties of quantum emitters through
engineered light-matter interactions is a key challenge in nanophotonics and
quantum optics. In this work, we demonstrate dynamic modulation of dipole's
decay rate by exploiting the tunable plexcitonic modes (graphene plasmons and
QD-excitons) in the strong coupling regime. By integrating a quantum dot inside
a graphene spherical shell and tuning the local optical response of hybrid
modes via voltage-bias, we achieve continuous and reversible control over the
decay rate, leading to significant enhancement or suppression of dipole
emission from near- to far-infrared regime. Furthermore, the plexcitonic peaks
shows much sharper linewidths in contrast to bare graphene plasmons even in the
off-resonant coupling which indicates higher sensitivity of the systems at
tuned wavelengths. We demonstrate the phenomenon with the numerical solution of
3D Maxwell's equations using MNPBEM tool. Our approach demonstrate a versatile
platform for programmable emission control and offer a promising pathway for
developing reconfigurable quantum photonic devices, such as tunable
single-photon sources and ultrafast optical switches.

Result: 两种平均方法在不同风向下对 Nusselt 数和承载电流有显著影响，尤其是平行和垂直风向情况

Conclusion: 研究结果表明在动态热计算中，平滑方法的选择非常关键，不同的平滑方法会导致不同的结果，应在具体应用中根据需要谨慎选择平滑方法

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of wind velocity averaging on Dynamic
Thermal Rating (DTR) calculations. It is based on a high-temporal-resolution (1
second) wind measurements obtained from a transmission line in Slovenia,
Europe. Wind speed and direction variability are analysed, and two averaging
methods, namely vector averaging, where velocity is averaged as vector, and
hybrid averaging, where speed is averaged as scalar, are employed. DTR
calculations are performed on both high-resolution data and averaged data (5
minute averaging window). It is demonstrated that averaging has a significant
effect on both Nusselt number and ampacity, and the effect exhibits a strong
angular dependency on the relative angle of the wind to the line. Therefore,
two limit cases are studied: in the case of parallel wind, averaged data
underestimates the ampacity, and there is a significant amount of cases where
the underestimation is larger than 10 %. In the case of perpendicular wind, the
two averaging methods affect the results in different ways, but both result in
a substantial amount of cases where ampacity is overestimated, potentially
leading to unsafe operation. The main takeaway of the study is that averaging
wind velocity has a significant impact on DTR results, and special emphasis
should be given to the averaging method, as different methods affect the
results in different ways.

Abstract: Low-field T2 mapping MRI can democratize neuropediatric imaging by improving

\textbf{Purpose:} To evaluate the feasibility of high-resolution T2 mapping
using a single-shot fast spin-echo (SS-FSE) sequence at 0.55~T in a healthy
control cohort. \textbf{Study Type:} Prospective single-center study.
\textbf{Population:} In vivo: ten healthy adults (18--43~years, 5 females/5
males). In vitro: NIST Phantom. \textbf{Field strength/sequence:} Multi-echo
ultra-fast spin-echo at 0.55~T and 1.5~T. \textbf{Assessment:} Feasibility was
first assessed in vitro using the NIST Phantom, comparing T2 relaxation times
to spectrometer references at 0.55~T. Acquisition and T2-fitting parameters
optimized in vitro were applied in vivo. Repeatability was evaluated by
atlas-based analysis of white matter (WM) and cortical grey matter (GM)
regions. Coefficients of variation (CoV) were computed across runs, sessions,
and subjects. \textbf{Statistical Tests:} Wilcoxon signed-rank test with
Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.05/n_{ROI}$) assessed CoV differences.
Pearson correlation coefficients quantified T2 associations. \textbf{Results:}
In vitro, mono-exponential fitting under Gaussian--Rician noise yielded
deviations $<12\%$ from reference values. In vivo, inter-subject CoV was 5.2\%
(WM) and 17.7\% (GM), comparable to 1.5~T. Mean T2 times were 118~ms (WM) and
188~ms (GM) at 0.55~T, with a 16.5-minute acquisition. \textbf{Conclusion:} A
rapid, robust high-resolution T2 mapping protocol at 0.55~T for HASTE MRI is
presented, employing Gaussian noise-based fitting. We report the first
normative T2 values for healthy adult brains at 0.55~T, demonstrating technical
feasibility and reliability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The recurrence-based divergence quantifier ($DIV$), traditionally applied to
dissipative systems, is shown here to be an effective finite-time chaos
indicator for conservative dynamics. We benchmark its performances against the
well-established fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI), focusing on the standard map, a
canonical model of Hamiltonian chaos. Through extensive numerical simulations
on moderately long orbits, we find strong agreement between $DIV$ and FLI,
supporting the reported correlation between the divergence of recurrences and
positive Lyapunov exponents. Additionally, our study sheds more light into
asymptotic time properties of $DIV$ by revealing distinct power laws for
regular and chaotic trajectories, both in the original and reconstructed phase
spaces. In particular, for regular dynamics, $DIV$ decays in average with the
time $N$ as $1/N$, mirroring the decay rate of the maximal Lyapunov exponent.
For chaotic trajectories, $DIV$ decreases at a much slower rate in average,
close to $1/\sqrt{N}$. This scaling insight opens new avenues for
characterizing chaos from time series. Our numerical results thus demonstrate
$DIV$ to be a computationally viable and theoretically rich tool for chaos
detection in conservative systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic reduction of the infinite-dimensional
symmetries of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur system when restricted to
multi-soliton solution. By systematically analyzing, we demonstrate that the
entire $K$-symmetry hierarchy collapses into a finite-dimensional module over
the field of wave parameters, spanned by elementary center-translation
generators. Higher order $K$-symmetries are explicitly reconstructed as linear
combinations of these basis vectors. In contrast, $\tau$-symmetries resist such
decomposition on pure soliton backgrounds, however, they become
finite-dimensional once the underlying solution space is extended to the full
multi-wave manifold, which carries more independent wave parameters. We
construct an explicit basis consisting of four fundamental symmetry vector
fields, two lowest $K$-symmetries and two primary $\tau$-symmetries, in terms
of which all higher $\tau$-symmetries are uniquely expressible as linear
combinations of these symmetry vector fields. These findings not only clarify
the algebraic structure of infinite symmetries on special solution, but also
provide an algorithmic framework for deriving exact multi-wave solutions of
integrable systems.

Abstract: A development effort to improve the performance of superconducting
radio-frequency half-wave resonators (SRF HWRs) is underway at the Facility for
Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), where 220 such resonators are in operation. Our goal
was to achieve an intrinsic quality factor (Q0) of >= 2E10 at an accelerating
gradient (Ea) of 12 MV/m. FRIB production resonators were prepared with
buffered chemical polishing (BCP). First trials on electropolishing (EP) and
post-EP low temperature baking (LTB) of FRIB HWRs allowed us to reach higher
gradient (15 MV/m, limited by quench) with a higher quality factor at high
gradient, but Q0 was still below our goal. Trapped magnetic flux during the
Dewar test was found to be a source of Q0 reduction. Three strategies were used
to reduce the trapped flux: (i) adding a local magnetic shield (LMGS) to
supplement the ``global'' magnetic shield around the Dewar for reduction of the
ambient magnetic field; (ii) performing a ``uniform cool-down'' (UC) to reduce
the thermoelectric currents; and (iii) using a compensation coil to further
reduce the ambient field with active field cancellation (AFC). The LMGS
improved the Q0, but not enough to reach our goal. With UC and AFC, we exceeded
our goal, reaching Q0 = 2.8E10 at Ea = 12 MV/m.

Abstract: Dispersive shock waves (DSWs) are expanding nonlinear wave trains that arise
when dispersion regularizes a steepening front, a phenomenon observed in
fluids, plasmas, optics, and superfluids. Here we report the first experimental
observation of DSWs in an intense electron beam, using the University of
Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). A localized induction-cell perturbation produced
a negative density pulse that evolved into a leading soliton-like peak followed
by an expanding train of oscillations. The leading peak satisfied soliton
scaling laws for width^2 vs inverse amplitude and velocity vs amplitude, while
the total wave-train width increased linearly with time, consistent with
Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) predictions. Successive peaks showed decreasing
amplitude and velocity toward the trailing edge, in agreement with dispersive
shock ordering. These results demonstrate that intense charged particle beams
provide a new laboratory platform for studying dispersive hydrodynamics,
extending nonlinear wave physics into the high-intensity beam regime.

Abstract: When aiming for atomic resolution electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD)
in STEM mode, the high convergence angle of the electron probe can lead to
unforeseen artefacts and strong reductions of the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
in the measurement of magnetic magnitudes. In this work, the EMCD signal is
measured in STEM mode at semi-convergence angles ranging from \alpha=\ 2-10\
mrad\ using iron samples with high structural perfection. We observe that the
relative EMCD signal remains very similar for all convergence angles, which is
in good agreement with simulations. The improvement in the signal-to-noise
ratio as compared to earlier works is due to better crystalline quality of the
Fe sample, high control of the sample orientation, better control over sample
thickness, and factors such as higher beam current and the use of a fast and
sensitive hybrid-pixel electron detector. One of the key factors to remove
experimental ambivalences is the use of an acquisition geometry where the two
conjugate EMCD spectra are acquired simultaneously. Furthermore the high
crystalline quality Fe sample enables the acquisition of statistical entities
of spectra at the same sample orientation, which in turn results in high SNR
EMCD signals. We obtain high SNR EMCD signals for all semi convergence angles
and could measure the orbital to spin magnetic moment ratio ml/ms with high
precision. We observed that at high convergence angles, the ml/ms ratio gets
sensitive to minute changes in sample orientation.

Abstract: Animal experiments play a vital role in drug discovery and development by
providing essential data on a drug's efficacy, safety, and physiological

micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) microfabrication technology. To
integrate the sensing structure with the metallic stent, a facile insertion

center using its natural buckling mechanism. Once fabricated, the stent implant
was expanded and installed within an airway-mimicking tube to validate its
functionality. A proof-of-concept trial using an artificial ventilator
successfully demonstrated real-time respiration monitoring, confirming the

we extend the microstate-counting method to the case of a finite-length
Einstein-Rosen bridge. As a result, the Hilbert space of the dS horizon in the
flow geometry can be spanned by states with a purely dS Einstein-Rosen bridge,
containing no AdS portion on the time-symmetric slice. This provides a concrete
realization of dS microstates within a controlled holographic framework.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: No-go定理表明，在Riemann平坦流形上的弦论和M-理论紧致化中，高维空间（d>3）中不存在dS最小值，但dS3最小值的现状仍需通过具体构造确认。


<details>

Motivation: 该研究探讨了在特定紧致化流形上的dS最小值的存在性，涉及弦论和M-理论中的紧致化问题。

Method: 通过分析几何和理论物理模型，研究作者论证了dS最小值的不存在性，并将其与半正定规划问题进行类比。

Result: 1. d>3维中不存在dS最小值；2. dS3最小值的存在性尚不确定；3. 搜索dS最小值可参考CFT Bootstrap领域的文献和工具。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了紧致化理论的局限性，强调了进一步研究和构造的重要性。

Abstract: We establish a no-go theorem in the context of string and M-theory flux
compactifications on Riemann-Flat manifolds with Casimir energy. Specifically,
we show that no dS minimum exists in this setup in dimension $d>3$. The case of
dS$_3$ minima is not excluded, but their actual fate can only be ascertained
via an explicit construction. We also point out that the problem of finding dS
minima on RFM's and more general flux compactifications is mathematically
equivalent to a semidefinite programming problem, identical to those studied in
CFT bootstrap, and hence the search for dS can benefit from the existing vast
literature and numerical tools. We illustrate this in a toy model.

Motivation: 研究极端准地视的非线性扰动如何影响其视线下发散性具有理论意义，有助于更深入理解极端事件的可能性和稳定性的极限。

Result: 发现非线性扰动导致视线下发散，与线性化结果一致。

Conclusion: 非线性扰动不导致视趋于极端，但会随着时间发散，线性化分析有效描述了长时间行为。

Abstract: It is known that linearized perturbations of extremal black holes result in
growing curvature on the horizon. However, nonlinear perturbations typically do
not evolve to extremal black holes and do not have growing curvature at late
times. We show that a large class of nonlinear perturbations of an extremal
planar anti-de Sitter black hole does have horizon curvature that grows
unbounded in time. The late time behavior of the nonlinear evolution is found
to be captured by a linearized analysis. We argue that the generic nonlinear
perturbation behaves similarly.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors describe a new tunneling solution for cosmic string decay into gravitational waves, with implications for singularity resolution in quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in exploring quantum gravity effects on singularities, particularly through cosmic string decay mechanisms.

Method: The authors employ instanton solutions and analytic continuation techniques, specifically considering the Kerr metric, to model the decay process.

Result: They find that while the initial state contains a conical singularity, the final state does not, suggesting a potential mechanism for singularity resolution in quantum gravity.

Conclusion: This study contributes to the understanding of quantum gravitational processes, showing that singularities might vanish unlike in classical general relativity.

Abstract: We describe a new tunneling solution for the decay of a cosmic string into a
burst of gravitational waves. We find the relevant instanton and compute the
tunneling rate. Locally, our solution is just an analytic continuation of the
Kerr metric (but there is no black hole in our solution). An interesting
feature of our result is that there is a conical singularity in the initial
state but there is no singularity in the final state. This demonstrates that
singularities can disappear in quantum gravity in ways that are impossible in
classical gravity.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the analyticity properties of the retarded Green's function $G^R(its,)$ in quantum lattice models and derives bounds on non-Fermi liquid couplings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore the constraints on Green's functions from microscopic causality, applicable to low-energy effective theories.

Method: Used Lieb-Robinson bounds, complex analysis, and studied specific Green's functions for non-Fermi liquids.

Result: An upper bound on the coupling magnitude in Hertz liquids and bounds on Green's function residue.

Conclusion: These findings enhance understanding of quantum dynamics in many-body systems.

Abstract: Quantum mechanical lattice models with local, bounded interactions obey
Lieb-Robinson causality. We show that this implies a domain of analyticity of
the retarded Green's function $G^R(\omega,{\bf k})$ of local lattice operators
as a function of complex frequency $\omega$ and momentum ${\bf k}$, similar to
the lightcone analyticity property of relativistic field theories. Low-energy
effective descriptions of the dynamics must be consistent with this microscopic
analyticity constraint. We consider two canonical low-energy fermionic Green's
functions describing non-Fermi liquids, the marginal Fermi liquid and the
`Hertz liquid'. The pole in these Green's functions must be outside of the
Lieb-Robinson domain of analyticity for all complex momenta captured by the
low-energy theory. We show that this constraint upper bounds the magnitude of
the dimensionless non-Fermi liquid coupling in certain Hertz liquids. We
furthermore obtain, from causality, an upper bound on the magnitude
$|G^R(\omega,{\bf k})|$ within the analytic domain. We use this bound to
constrain the quasiparticle residue of the non-Fermi liquids.

### [109] [Geometric Symmetries for the Vanishing of the Black Hole Tidal Love Numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18952)
*Roman Berens,Lam Hui,Daniel McLoughlin,Riccardo Penco,John Staunton*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A unified geometric perspective on perturbations of Schwarzschild black holes across spins 0, 1, and 2 reveals exact SO(3,1) symmetries in both even and odd sectors, connected by an SO(2) symmetry. These symmetries explain the vanishing of tidal Love numbers and Wilson coefficients for tidal responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding perturbations of black holes is fundamental for studying gravitational physics and tests of general relativity.

Method: Analyzes symmetries using SO(3,1) group theory by examining actions and variables for different spin perturbations.

Result: Exact SO(3,1) symmetries are identified, and they connect via SO(2), explaining key observed phenomena in tidal responses.

Conclusion: This provides a comprehensive framework connecting symmetries to tidal effects in black hole physics.

Abstract: We present a unified geometric perspective on the symmetries underlying the
spin 0, 1 and 2 static perturbations around a Schwarzschild black hole. In all
cases, the symmetries are exact, each forming an SO(3,1) group. They can be
formulated at the level of the action, provided the appropriate field variables
are chosen. For spin 1 and 2, the convenient variables are certain combinations
of the gauge fields for even perturbations, and dual scalars for odd
perturbations. The even and odd sector each has its own SO(3,1) symmetry. In
addition, there is an SO(2) symmetry connecting them, furnishing an economical
description of Chandrasekhar's duality. When decomposed in spherical harmonics,
the perturbations form a non-trivial representation of SO(3,1), giving rise to
ladder symmetries which explain the vanishing of the tidal Love numbers. Our
work builds on earlier discussions of ladder symmetries, which were formulated
in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar at the level of the Teukolsky equation.
Our formulation makes it possible to state the symmetries responsible for the
vanishing of the Wilson coefficients characterizing the spin 0, 1 and 2 static
tidal response, in the effective point particle description of a black hole.

Motivation: 研究环内规范场对引力振幅的影响，探索退格关系，尤其是在一环和纯引力振幅中寻找新的理论框架。

Method: 使用了Landau-Lifshitz度规密度方法，将规范场与引力耦合，计算了一环四引力子振幅，寻找分子结构中的双复制特性。

Result: 发现分子中存在明显的双复制结构，无接触项的n边形分子可以直接用于构造环内规范场对振幅的影响，特别是在纯引力振幅中，发现了一种简化研究单环退格关系的方法。

Conclusion: 引入环内规范场可以提供新的研究退格关系的角度，尤其是可以通过直接构造振幅分子来探索纯引力振幅。

Abstract: In this work, we compute the one-loop four-graviton amplitudes with a massive
abelian vector field (Proca) circulating in the loop. Instead of the
conventional Einstein-Hilbert formulation, we employ the Landau-Lifshitz metric
density approach, coupling gravity to the Proca field. Within this framework,
we found that the resulting contact-terms-free $n$-gon numerators exhibit a
manifest double-copy structure, provided the external gravitational trees
satisfy this property. This structure enables the direct construction of the
corresponding amplitudes with a scalar in the loop. We further show that these
numerators can be consistently used to evaluate pure gravity amplitudes in the
sectors where contact terms vanish, offering a simplified setting to explore
double-copy relations at one loop level.

Method: 通过引力路径积分计算PSSY模型中的Wigner繁琐度，研究动态模型中的早时和久后现象，提出几何公式并证明。

Result: Wigner繁琐度在Page transition前为O(1)，后变为指数级大；动态模型中早时有峰值，久后符合相同公式；提出通用几何公式。

Conclusion: 结论验证了霍金辐射复杂度的普适性和量子计算理论的有效性。

Abstract: We study the complexity of Hawking radiation for an evaporating black hole
from the perspective of the stabilizer theory of quantum computation.
Specifically, we calculate Wigner negativity -- a magic monotone which can be
interpreted as a measure of the stabilizer complexity, or equivalently, the
complexity of classical simulation -- in various toy models for evaporating
black holes. We first calculate the Wigner negativity of Hawking radiation in
the PSSY model directly using the gravitational path integral, and show that
the negativity is $O(1)$ before the Page transition, but becomes exponentially
large past the Page transition. We also derive a universal, information
theoretic formula for the negativity which interpolates between the two
extremes. We then study the Wigner negativity of radiation in a dynamical model
of black hole evaporation. In this case, the negativity shows a sharp spike at
early times resulting from the coupling between the black hole and the
radiation system, but at late times when the system settles down, we find that
the negativity satisfies the same universal formula as in the PSSY model.
Finally, we also propose a geometric formula for Wigner negativity in general
holographic states using intuition from fixed area states and random tensor
networks, and argue that a python's lunch in the entanglement wedge implies a
stabilizer complexity which is exponentially large in $\frac{1}{8G_N}$ times
the difference between the areas corresponding to the outermost and minimal
extremal surfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现了一种新的无限类零式不可逆对称性，在涵盖Gaillard和Zumino（GZ）先前研究的多种四维模型中，包括扩展的超重力的各种子类。这些模型通常涉及非阿贝尔规范场和中性场，其作用方程组在经典群$unc{G}$的变换下自动保持不变，其中$unc{G}$是对偶作用群，由中性场的对称群构成。通过引入一种非可逆的拓扑缺陷，这些对称性在量子水平被部分保留下来，虽然在传统观点下这些对称性会被约简为整数子群$unc{G}_{Z}$。我们通过构造这些缺陷并计算部分融合规则，展示了这些拓扑缺陷如何维持这些对称性。此外，我们还通过具体的例子，如axion-dilaton-Maxwell模型和形如$unc{N}=2$超重力的 bosonic 部分，来说明这些非可逆零形对称性的应用。最后，我们讨论了如何通过伽格$unc{G}_{Z}$的可逆对称性子群的 gauging 来部分打破这些非可逆对称性。这一研究不仅扩展了我们对对偶对称性的理解，也为超重力和弦理论中的潜在应用提供了理论基础。

Method: 我们首先通过群论方法分析了GZ模型中的对称性，并找到可以被保护的无限类非可逆零形对称性。接着，我们构造了相应的非可逆拓扑缺陷，并计算了它们的融合规则。通过构建具体的物理模型，我们验证了这些对称性的存在和保护机制。最后，我们讨论了如何通过引入可逆对称性子群的 gauging 来部分打破这些对称性，从而揭示了对称性的部分保留方式。

Result: 我们发现，传统观点认为这些对称性会被约简为整数子群$unc{G}_{Z}$的说法并不完全正确。实际上，通过引入非可逆的拓扑缺陷，这些对称性可以被部分保留下来，形成一个更大的子群$unc{G}_{Q}$。我们成功构造了这些缺陷并计算了它们的融合规则，证明了这些缺陷的稳定性以及对称性保护的机制。通过具体的物理模型分析，我们验证了这些理论结果的正确性。最后，我们提出了如何通过引入可逆对称性子群的 gauging 来部分打破这些非可逆对称性，从而为研究对称性保留提供了新的思路。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了在量子水平上如何通过非可逆对称性保持机制来保存更多的对称性。通过对具体的物理模型进行分析，我们能够清晰地观察到这些对称性在量子修正下的保持情况，从而更深入地理解了对偶对称性在量子重力理论中的角色。我们的结果为扩展超重力理论和弦理论中的对称性研究提供了重要的理论依据。

Abstract: We uncover an infinite class of novel zero-form non-invertible symmetries in
a broad family of four-dimensional models, studied years ago by Gaillard and
Zumino (GZ), which includes several extended supergravities as particular
subcases. The GZ models consist of abelian gauge fields coupled to a neutral
sector, typically including a set of scalars, whose equations of motion are
classically invariant under a continuous group $\mathscr{G}$ acting on the
electric and magnetic field strengths via symplectic transformations. The
standard lore holds that, at the quantum level, these symmetries are broken to
an integral subgroup $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Z}$. We show that, in fact, a much
larger subgroup $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ survives, albeit through
non-invertible topological defects. We explicitly construct these defects and
compute some of their fusion rules. As illustrative examples, we consider the
axion-dilaton-Maxwell model and the bosonic sector of a class of
$\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities of the kind that appear in type II Calabi-Yau
compactifications. Finally, we comment on how (part of) these non-invertible
zero-form symmetries can be broken by gauging the $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Z}$
subgroup of invertible symmetries.

Result: 在d=2中，固定点对应于M(2,7)模型；在d=3中，通过约束Padé外推估计了临界指数。此外，提出了最小模型M(2,2n+1)可能与带有iφ^{2n-1}相互作用的理论有关的猜想。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于无质量标量场论及其PT对称性在不同维度中的有趣见解，并提出了关于最小模型的新猜想。

Abstract: We discuss dimensional continuation of the massless scalar field theory with
the $i\phi^5$ interaction term. It preserves the so-called $\mathcal{PT}$
symmetry, which acts by $\phi\rightarrow -\phi$ accompanied by $i\rightarrow
-i$. Below its upper critical dimension $10/3$, this theory has interacting
infrared fixed points. We argue that the fixed point in $d=2$ describes the
non-unitary minimal conformal model $M(2,7)$. We identify the operators $\phi$
and $\phi^2$ with the Virasoro primaries $\phi_{1,2}$ and $\phi_{1,3}$,
respectively, and $i\phi^3$ with a quasi-primary operator, which is a Virasoro
descendant of $\phi_{1,3}$. Our identifications appear to be consistent with
the operator product expansions and with considerations based on integrability.
Using constrained Pad\'e extrapolations, we provide estimates of the critical
exponents in $d=3$. We also comment on possible lattice descriptions of
$M(2,7)$ and discuss RG flows to and from this CFT. Finally, we conjecture that
the minimal models $M(2, 2n+1)$ are described by the massless scalar field
theories with the $i\phi^{2n-1}$ interaction terms.

Method: 研究者使用Abelian-投影的真空波函数，该函数集中在由中心漩涡和磁单极形成的链结构中。通过对规范不变的两点场强观测函数进行计算，利用这些观察函数来分析相关函数的行为。

Result: 研究表明，规范不变的两点场强观测函数显示出具有类似质量的特征，因为中心漩涡和磁单极的非定向软组成部分具有相同的堆叠机制，该机制导致了面积法则和Casmir比例缩放的色弦张力。

Abstract: Lattice simulations and theoretical analyses consistently identify center
vortices and monopoles as key nonperturbative configurations in Yang-Mills
theory. Independently, studies of correlation functions reveal an infrared
behavior characterized by massive-like scales. Yet, an open issue is how such
correlators can arise in a confining regime characterized by a linearly rising
potential rather than a Yukawa one. Using an Abelian-projected vacuum
wavefunctional peaked on chains formed by center vortices and monopoles, we
compute gauge-invariant field-strength correlators. We show the emergence of a
massive-like correlator constructed from the gauge-invariant two-point field
strength observable. This behavior arises from the nonoriented soft component
of the center-vortex condensate, the same hierarchical mechanism previously
shown to produce the area law and Casimir scaling of string tensions.

Abstract: The status of several representative gauge theories on various quantum

matrix model formulations is overviewed. The common building blocks are
derivation based differential calculus possibly twisted and noncommutative
analog of the Koszul connection. The star-products related to the quantum
space-times are obtained from a combination of harmonic analysis of group
algebras combined with Weyl quantization. The remaining problems inherent to
gauge theories on Moyal spaces in their two different formulations are
outlined. A family of gauge invariant matrix models on $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$,
a deformation of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is presented among which a solvable model. The
characterization of 11 new quantum Minkowski space-times through their
$*$-algebras is given. A gauge theory of Yang-Mills type is constructed on one
recently explored of these space-times and compared to its counterpart built on
the popular $\kappa$-Minkowski.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the dynamical mass generation for fermions in
pseudo-Proca QED, which represents an effective theory in (2+1)D arising from
the dimensional reduction of the Proca Lagrangian, where the interaction is
mediated by a gauge field with finite mass $m$. Using the Schwinger-Dyson
equations within the rainbow approximation, we study both quenched and
unquenched regimes. We determine the critical coupling $\alpha_c(m,\Lambda)$
and the critical number of fermion flavors $N_c(m,\Lambda)$ that govern chiral
symmetry breaking. We also examine the criticality in the anisotropic case,
where fermions propagate with a Fermi velocity $v_F\neq c$. These results could
be useful for understanding quantum criticality in low-dimensional systems and
engineered platforms with tunable interactions.

Abstract: We investigate Podolsky quantum electrodynamics (POQED), a higher-derivative
extension of QED in (3+1)D, and perform its dimensional reduction to (2+1)D by
confining the Dirac current to a plane while allowing the gauge field to
propagate out of the plane. The resulting model, which we call Pseudo
Generalized QED (PGQED), is minimally coupled to massless Dirac fermions. In
the strong-coupling regime, we show that a dynamical mass is generated through
approximate solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equation, leading to chiral
symmetry breaking and modifications of the fermion dispersion relation. We
derive an analytic critical coupling $\alpha_{c}(\mu)$ and flavors critical
number $N_{c}(\mu)$, dependent on the Podolsky parameter $\mu$ and the
ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$. These analytical results are found to be
consistent with the numerical analysis. Finally, we discuss connections to
graphene, estimating a range for $\mu$ in the ultrarelativistic limit.

Conclusion: 该研究为研究超级共形固定点和AdS对偶提供了新的视角。通过分类不同的规范理论，作者澄清了它们在大$N$极限中的行为，并验证了关于AdS弱引力猜想的相关假设。最后一，作者的工作可能为理解大$N$规范理论和 String Theory提供了新见解。

Abstract: We classify four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories
with a simple gauge group admitting a large $N$ limit that flow to non-trivial
superconformal fixed points in the infrared. We focus on the cases where the
large $N$ limit can be taken while keeping the flavor symmetry fixed so that
the putative holographic dual has a fixed gauge group. We find that they can be
classified into three types -- Type I, Type II, and Type III -- exhibiting
universal behavior. Type I theories have $a \neq c$ in the large $N$ limit and
scale linearly in $N$; the gap of scaling dimensions among BPS operators
behaves as $1/N$. Type II theories have $a=c$ in the large $N$ limit, and
satisfy $a \simeq c \simeq \frac{27}{128} \dim G$, and Type III theories have
$a \simeq c \simeq \frac{1}{4} \dim G$. For Type II and Type III theories, the
gap of scaling dimensions stays $O(1)$ in the large $N$ limit. We enumerate
relevant and marginal operators of these theories and find that non-trivial
conformal manifolds emerge upon relevant deformations. Moreover, we find that a
modified version of the AdS Weak Gravity Conjecture, based on the
supersymmetric Cardy formula, holds for all of these theories, even for finite
$N$.

Abstract: In this article we consider type II superstring in the pure spinor
formulation with constant background fields in the context of T-dualization.
First we prove that bosonic and fermionic T-dualization commute using already
known T-dual transformation laws for bosonic and fermionic T-dualization.
Consequently, the T-dual transformation laws of the full T-dualization are
obtained. At the end the full T-dualization is realized in double space and it
is showed that Buscher procedure and double space approach are equivalent in
this specific case.

Abstract: We consider fermionic fields of higher spin on a four-dimensional de Sitter
background. A particular emphasis is placed on the Rarita-Schwinger
spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ case. Both massive fields and gauge fields are considered,
and their relation to the representation theory of $SO(4,1)$ is discussed. In
Lorentzian signature, we study properties of the Bunch-Davies mode functions,
and the late time structure of their two-point functions. For the
Rarita-Schwinger gauge field, we consider a quantisation procedure based on the
Minkowskian limit of the field operator. In Euclidean signature, the fields are
placed on a four-sphere and the Euclidean path integral is computed at
one-loop. The resulting Euclidean partition function is expressed in terms of
unitary Lorentzian group characters with edge corrections. The unitary nature
of the characters contrasts the lack of a conventional real action for the
Rarita-Schwinger gauge field in de Sitter space. We speculate on the
microscopic properties of a theory comprised of an infinite tower of
interacting integer and half-integer gauge fields in de Sitter space. Along the
way, we discuss a potentially interesting expression for the higher-spin path
integral on the four-sphere.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 该论文研究了4维带有边界的Maxwell理论，在自由和相互作用的情况下分析了全局性质的边界条件，发现部分威尔逊-‘t 赫曼线被平凡化，另一些成为拓扑线并生成边界1形式对称性。还研究了 bulk对偶和耦合重新标度在3d拓扑界面中的映射，这些界面生成$	ext{SL}(2,	ext{Q})$在 bulk复耦合$	au$上的作用，推广了 usual $	ext{SL}(2,	ext{Z})$在3d CFT中的作用。最后从5d的SymTFT图景中 streamlined地重建了结果。并讨论了非紧凑3d边模式的可能包含。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maxwell理论在有边界的4维空间中的全局性质及其与 bulk对偶和精确结果之间的关系是当前理论物理中的一个热点问题。该论文通过研究威尔逊-‘t 赫曼线在 bulk和边界的行为，并引入 bulk对偶和耦合重新标度的3d拓扑接口，揭示了$	ext{SL}(2,	ext{Q})$在复耦合$	au$上的作用，这些工作不仅深化了我们对边界条件和topological对称性在高维理论中的理解，还为三维/四维对偶性提供了一种新的视角。

Method: 该论文采用的是理论分析与数学构造相结合的方法。首先通过分析Maxwell理论在带有边界的情况，明确了局域性和全局性质的行为。接着引入了 bulk对偶和3d拓扑接口的概念，并通过这些接口研究了$	ext{SL}(2,	ext{Q})$对$	au$的作用。最终通过构建5d的SymTFT图景来简化和统一结果。整个过程采用了几何和代数的方法相结合，深入挖掘了理论模型的内在结构。

Result: 论文的主要结果可以总结为以下几点：1. 在4d带有边界的Maxwell理论中，部分威尔逊-‘t 赫曼线在 bulk中被平凡化，而另一些则在边界中成为拓扑线，生成了边界上的1形式对称性。2. 3d的拓扑接口通过 bulk对偶和耦合重新标度将 bulk中的对称性映射到了边界，这将普通$	ext{SL}(2,	ext{Z})$群推广到了更广泛的$	ext{SL}(2,	ext{Q})$群。3. 通过构建5d的对偶理论图景，论文提供了一个 streamlined的方式来理解上述结果，并且在这种框架下，包括非紧凑边模式在内的潜在现象也可以自然地纳入分析。

Conclusion: 该论文通过研究4维Maxwell理论在带边界的情况，揭示了边界条件和拓扑对称性之间的深刻联系。通过引入 bulk对偶和拓扑接口的方法，不仅推广了现有的对称性群，还为更高维理论的对偶性提供了新的框架。最终，在5d的SymTFT图景中，论文提供了对这些现象的统一和简化的理解，并指出未来可以进一步探索非紧凑边模式的可能性。

Abstract: We revisit Maxwell theory in 4d with a boundary, with particular attention to
the global properties of the boundary conditions, both in the free
(topological) and interacting (conformal) cases. We analyze the fate of
Wilson-'t Hooft lines, identifying the subset that is trivialized on the
boundary and the ones that become topological, thus generating a boundary
1-form symmetry. We further study how the boundary conditions are mapped to
each other by 3d topological interfaces implementing bulk dualities and
rescalings of the coupling. Together, these interfaces generate an
$SL(2,\mathbb{Q})$ action on the bulk complexified coupling $\tau$, and they
generalize the usual $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ action on 3d CFTs by including both
topological and non-topological manipulations within a unified framework. We
then show how to recover our results in a streamlined way from a SymTFT picture
in 5d with corners. Finally, we comment on the possible inclusion of
non-compact 3d edge modes.

Motivation: 对张量模型在大N极限下的主导图形进行研究，有助于理解其相 strutture behavior和相变，同时扩展了已知的结果范围。

Method: 我们使用了张量的中间场方法，最初仅用于普适六面体相互作用， adapted到本研究中的全部连通六次相互作用（除轮圈相互作用外），并通过循环分析单独处理轮圈相互作用。

Result: 在1/N展开中，主导图形被识别为圈图、梅尔职业技能，以及新的张量图形。

Abstract: We study a sextic tensor model where the interaction terms are given by all
$O(N)^3$-invariant bubbles. The class of invariants studied here is thus a
larger one that the class of the $U(N)^3$-invariant sextic tensor model. We
implement the large $N$ limit mechanism for this general model and we
explicitly identify the dominant graphs in the $1/N$ expansion. This class of
dominant graphs contains tadpole graphs, melonic graphs but also new types of
tensor graphs. Our analysis adapts the tensorial intermediate field method,
previously applied only to the prismatic interaction, to all connected sextic
interactions except the wheel interaction, which we treat separately using a
cycle analysis.

TL;DR: 研究了AdS3引力 bulk与 Narain CFTs之间的关系，得出了关于中央电荷、规范电荷秩等界线的结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdS/CFT 理论作为弦理论的重要组成部分，研究其边界规范场论的性质对于理解弦理论和量子引力有很大帮助。Swampland计划致力于确定所有可能的量子引力理论的共同限制。因此，研究AdS3引力 bulk与 Narain CFTs之间的关系对于Swampland计划有重要指导意义。

Method: 在这研究中，主要是利用AdS距离猜测量和有限性猜测量，结合 anomalies和unitarity要求，得出了关于 Narain CFTs的约束。具体来说，研究了AdS3引力 bulk的中央电荷和规范电荷秩的关系。

Result: 研究结果表明，Narain CFTs的中央电荷必须是有限的。此外，通过结合anomaly和unitarity要求，得出了规范电荷秩的上界。具体来说，规范电荷秩的上界主要由AdS3引力 bulk的Chern-Simons水平k^G的范围决定，从而决定了AdS3 radius的一个上界。研究还将Narain景像限制在了一个有限的范围内，指定了一个上限和一个下限，具体范围为3/2 ≤ c ≤ 10^3。

Conclusion: 本研究通过AdS3引力 bulk与 Narain CFTs之间的关系，得出了关于中央电荷和规范电荷秩的重要约束。These约束为Swampland计划提供了新的见解，并且限定了Narain景像的规模，这有助于更系统地探索和分类量子引力理论。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the AdS$_{3}$ gravitational bulk dual to an
ensemble of Narain CFTs and their generalisations to establish bounds
consistent with the Swampland program. Focusing on the AdS distance and
finiteness conjectures, we show that the central charge of Narain CFTs forming
the ensemble must be finite. Combining anomaly and unitary requirements, we
derive an upper bound on the rank of the abelian U(1) gauge symmetries that can
consistently couple to the AdS$_{3}$ gravity. We give explicit realisations of
these constraints by determining the range of the Chern-Simons level $k^{G}$
corresponding to a bounded AdS$_{3}$ radius$.$ Accordingly, the Narain
landscape is finite with a number of admissible CFTs constrained as
$3/2\lesssim c\lesssim 10^{3}.$

Abstract: The dynamics of a stack of M5 branes probing a transverse multi-centered
Taub-NUT space are described by a class of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$
superconformal field theories known as the M-string orbifold SCFTs. We
determine the equivariant partition functions for this class of theories on a
geometric background of type $T^2\times\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma
\in\{\mathcal{C}_N,\mathcal{Q}_N, \mathcal{T},\mathcal{O},\mathcal{I}\}$ is an
arbitrary finite subgroup of $SU(2)$. The partition functions are built out of
contributions from BPS strings as well as BPS particles that arise upon putting
the 6d theory on a circle. We find that BPS particle contributions can be
expressed in terms of $\Gamma$-covariant Hilbert series which count holomorphic
sections of vector bundles on the orbifold singularity with monodromy specified
by an irreducible representation of $\Gamma$. The BPS string contributions, on
the other hand, are given by the elliptic genera of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$
$\Gamma$-dressed quiver gauge theories, obtained by stacking
Kronheimer-Nakajima quivers of type $\Gamma$ between interfaces that support
current algebras for the McKay dual affine Lie algebra
$\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We obtain explicit expressions for the elliptic
genera of arbitrary BPS string configurations corresponding to fractional
instanton strings on $\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$, and for the case of star-shaped
quivers of type
$\Gamma\in\{\mathcal{Q}_4,\mathcal{T},\mathcal{O},\mathcal{I}\}$ we give a
prescription to compute the elliptic genera by gluing 2d analogues of Gaiotto
and Witten's $T[SU(N)]$ theories.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We analyze the N=1 supersymmetric complex Liouville string theory (SCLS) and its dual matrix model, comparing it to the bosonic complex Liouville string theory (CLS). We also investigate a related theory, SCLS, which differs in the gauged worldsheet supersymmetry. The research finds similarities between SCLS and CLS in terms of their amplitudes and proposes that their dual matrix models are the same. A parallel analysis is performed for SCLS, with a candidate dual matrix model proposed. Finally, partial numerical evaluation of the moduli space integral provides evidence for the dualities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liouville string theory is a fundamental theoretical framework in theoretical physics, and understanding its supersymmetric extensions is crucial for advancing our knowledge of complex systems and dualities. This research contributes to the broader field by examining these extensions and their relationships.

Method: We study the (type 0B) N=1 supersymmetric complex Liouville string (SCLS), a supersymmetric extension of the bosonic complex Liouville string (Cls). We compute the sphere three-point amplitudes (including NS-NS-NS and NS-R-R types) and find they share the same form as the sphere three-point amplitude of the bosonic Cls. Analysis of the analytic structure of the NS-NS-NS-NS four-point amplitude and the higher equations of motion also yields results identical to the bosonic case. Based on these findings, we propose that the dual matrix model for SCLS is the same as that for the bosonic cls. We also investigate a related theory, sclS, which differs in the gauged worldsheet supersymmetry. A parallel analysis is performed for sclS, with a candidate dual matrix model proposed. We then carry out a partial numerical evaluation of the moduli space integral, which provides further evidence for both the proposals of the dual matrix model regarding SCLS and sclS.

Result: The research successfully demonstrates that the supersymmetric extensions of the complex Liouville string theory maintain the same structural and functional properties as their bosonic counterparts. Moreover, the proposed dual matrix models for both theories appear to be valid, as supported by the numerical evaluation of the moduli space integral. These findings contribute to the development of theoretical frameworks for string theory and complex systems.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive study of the N=1 supersymmetric complex Liouville string theory and its dual matrix model, as well as a related theory, Scls, which differs in the gauged worldsheet supersymmetry. The results obtained in this research validate the proposed dual matrix models for both theories and offer further insight into the properties of these complex systems. The findings are a valuable contribution to the field of theoretical physics.

Abstract: We study the (type 0B) $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric complex Liouville
string ($\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$), a supersymmetric extension of the
bosonic complex Liouville string ($\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$). We compute the sphere
three-point amplitudes (including NS-NS-NS and NS-R-R types) and find they
share the same form as the sphere three-point amplitude of the bosonic

identical to the bosonic case. Based on these findings, we propose that the
dual matrix model for the $\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$ is the same as that for
the bosonic $\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$. We also investigate a related theory
$\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$, which differs in the gauged worldsheet
supersymmetry. A parallel analysis is performed for
$\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$, and a candidate for its dual matrix
model is proposed. We then carry out a partial numerical evaluation of the
moduli space integral, which provides further evidence for both the proposals
of the dual matrix model regarding $\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$ and
$\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$.

Abstract: We investigate the holographic realization of topological operators for

study, we focus on Type IIB string theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ which admits an

We argue that symmetry operators for continuous symmetries are generally
realized by bound states of D5-branes and KK monopoles hanging from the
conformal boundary. Together they account for the contributions to the Gauss'
law constraints from the self-dual 5-form flux and the Einstein-Hilbert term
respectively. We also demonstrate how the D5-KK bound state measures the
representation of the endpoint of Wilson lines constructed by D3-branes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The fermionic Hubbard model, when combined with the ingredient of
frustration, associated with the breaking of particle-hole symmetry, harbors a
rich phase diagram. Aspects of theoretical findings associated with the nature
of magnetism and metallicity, in a diverse set of parameter regimes, are now
being actively investigated in triangular Hubbard cold atom and solid-state
(moir\'e) based emulators. Building on the theoretical work of Haerter and
Shastry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,087202 (2005)], we explore the impact of
kinetically frustrated magnetism, a phenomenon where antiferromagnetic order
emerges without any underlying magnetic interactions, at finite hole density.
We numerically study the infinite-$U$ triangular Hubbard model using the
density matrix renormalization group algorithm and estimate the extent of
stability of the kinetically induced $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic state to
hole doping. Beyond the Haerter-Shastry regime, we find an intermediate phase
with multimer (involving multiple correlated spins) stripes that eventually
gives way to a paramagnet. We also find evidence of gapless charge excitations
(metallicity) throughout the phase diagram for finite hole density. We discuss
the implications at large, but finite and realistic values of $U/t$, and
investigate whether kinetic magnetism and superexchange collaborate or compete.

Abstract: Altermagnets are fully compensated collinear antiferromagnets that lack the
combined time-reversal and translation symmetry. Here we show that their
symmetry allows for a switchable ferro-spinetic polarization - the spin
analogue of ferroelectricity - in a direction dictated by the lattice symmetry.
We demonstrate this effect first in its purest form in an interacting
altermagnetic fermion model, in which a many-body chiral symmetry forbids any
charge polarization. Our quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal edge-localized,
reversible spin accumulations fully consistent with this symmetry locking.
Breaking the chiral symmetry releases the charge sector: a ferroelectric
polarization emerges orthogonal to the ferro-spinetic one, yielding mutually
perpendicular switchable spin- and charge-polarized responses. We identify
Mn-based metal-organic frameworks as realistic hosts for this effect, offering
a practical route for experimental verification.

*Chen Lu,Chuang Li,Chao Cao,Huiqiu Yuan,Fu-Chun Zhang,Lun-Hui Hu*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses inversion-symmetry-broken alternating magnetic (AM) fluctuations in a two-orbital model with van Hove singularities, showing that they mediate inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity through a Josephson-type pairing mechanism, distinct from ferromagnetic spin-triplet pairing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of spin fluctuations in superconductivity is a fundamental question in condensed matter physics. This paper aims to clarify how AM fluctuations mediate superconductivity by addressing the competition between intra- and inter-orbital pairing mechanisms.

Method: The authors construct a two-orbital model with two van Hove singularities and analyze AM fluctuations broken by inversion symmetry. They employ a mean-field approach to demonstrate that the broken symmetry induces momentum-orbital locking and inter-van-Hove nesting leads to a sign-changing Josephson coupling, resulting in inter-orbital spin-triplet pairing.

Result: Inversion-symmetry-broken AM fluctuations generically favor inter-orbital spin-triplet pairing, as the subdominant inter-van-Hove nesting induces an internal Josephson coupling. This coupling changes sign, leading to an order parameter distinct from ferromagnetic spin-triplet pairing.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that inversion-symmetry-broken AM fluctuations can mediate inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity, highlighting a novel mechanism distinct from ferromagnetic pairing.

Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) fluctuations are a new class of collinear spin
fluctuations whose role in mediating superconductivity faces a fundamental
tension: their $\Gamma$-point peak favors intra-orbital spin-triplet pairing,
while their spin compensation favors inter-orbital singlets. Here, we
demonstrate that inversion-symmetry-broken AM fluctuations generically resolve
this competition in favor of spin-triplet pairing. As a proof of concept, we
study a minimal two-orbital model with two van Hove singularities. The broken
inversion symmetry induces momentum-orbital locking: the same orbital dominates
at opposite momenta, enhancing the triplet channel. Crucially, a subdominant
fluctuation channel arising from inter-van-Hove nesting provides an internal
Josephson coupling that locks the phase difference between triplet pairs on
different orbitals. We find this coupling changes sign ($+$ to $-$) upon a
crossover from AM-dominant to ferromagnetic-dominant fluctuations. The
resulting $\pi$-phase difference manifests as a $\tau_z$-type order parameter,
$c_{k,1\uparrow}c_{-k,1\uparrow} - c_{k,2\uparrow}c_{-k,2\uparrow}$. Although
intra-orbital in the original basis, its orbital-nontrivial character, as
manifested by its equivalence to inter-orbital pairing under rotation, defines
a general \textit{inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity}. This state is
distinct from the $\tau_0$-triplet pairing mediated by ferromagnetic
fluctuations, as evidenced by the canceled intra-orbital supercurrent in a
Josephson junction between them.

Abstract: We present a unified many-body perturbation theory for open quantum systems,
that treats dissipation, correlations, and external driving on equal footing.
Using a Keldysh-Lindblad formalism, we introduce diagrammatic treatment of
dissipative interaction lines representing quasiparticle flows and
fluctuations. Two new Feynman rules render the evaluation of dissipative
diagrams compact and systematically improvable, while preserving the Keldysh
and anti-Hermitian symmetries of the closed-system theory. Consequently, the
structure of the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE) remains unchanged, enabling
existing numerical methods to be directly applied. To illustrate this, we
derive dissipative versions of the second Born and GW approximations,
identifying the physical content of the self-energy components. Moreover, we
demonstrate that time-linear approximations to the full KBE retain their closed
structure and can be efficiently used to simulate relaxation and decoherence
dynamics. This framework establishes a general route toward first-principles
modeling of correlated, driven, and dissipative quantum materials.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a solid-state platform for building quantum
simulators using implanted spin centers in solid-state materials. We build upon
the proposal for an $S=1$ chain of spin centers coupled through the magnetic
dipole-dipole interaction and subjected to an external magnetic field as a
quantum simulator for critical floating phases. We introduce another magnetic
field and map the system to the interacting Kitaev chain. This setup, tunable
through the applied fields and the orientation of the spin centers within the
crystal, exhibits a variety of rich quantum behavior which notably includes
floating phases, a $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking phase, and lines of both
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Pokrovsky-Talapov transitions.
Furthermore, we employ several novel methods to calculate the Luttinger liquid
parameter in our model with incommensurate correlations. We find that these
methods provide a route to identify BKT transitions with less computational
resources than utilizing entanglement entropy and central charge.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper presents measurements of electrical resistivity in the heavy-fermion ferromagnet UGe₂ under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T, revealing anisotropic effects on electronic correlations and magnetic stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study of heavy fermion materials and their magnetic properties under high fields, with implications for understanding novel quantum states and magnetic ordering.

Method: Pulsed magnetic field measurements of electrical resistivity using UGe₂, a prototypical heavy-fermion ferromagnet, along three magnetic axes.

Result: Electrical resistivity decreases when magnetic field is applied along the easy (a) axis but remains unchanged for hard (b, c) axes. Field-induced destabilization of ferromagnetic state is anisotropic: anomaly at Tc disappears at >1 T for a-axis and >20 T for b, c-axes. Below 2 K, quantum oscillations observed in fields >50 T along b-axis support two-dimensional Fermi surface.

Conclusion: Anisotropic effects are dominant in UGe₂ under high magnetic fields, with strong implications for understanding heavy fermion physics and intertwined magnetic orders.

Abstract: We present electrical-resistivity measurements on the prototypical
heavy-fermion ferromagnet UGe$_2$ under pulsed magnetic field up to 60~T. An
anisotropic field-induced suppression of the electronic correlations is
revealed. The electrical resistivity strongly decreases when a magnetic field
$\mathbf{H}$ is applied along the easy magnetic axis $\mathbf{a}$, while it
remains almost unchanged when $\mathbf{H}$ is applied along the hard magnetic
axes $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$. The field-induced destabilization of the
ferromagnetic state is also anisotropic: the anomaly at the Curie temperature
$T_C$ disappears in fields higher than $\gtrsim1$~T for
$\mathbf{H}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and in fields higher than $\gtrsim20$~T for
$\mathbf{H}\parallel\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$. At temperatures below 2~K, we
observe quantum oscillations in fields larger than 50~T applied along
$\mathbf{b}$, which support the presence of a two-dimensional Fermi surface
similar to that previously observed at low fields.

### [134] [Pairing Symmetry Crossover from $d$-wave to $s_{\pm}$-wave in a Bilayer Nickelate Driven by Hund's Coupling and Crystal Field Splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19406)
*Yicheng Xiong,Yanmei Cai,Tianxing Ma*

TL;DR: The bilayer nickelate superconductor La3Ni2O7's pairing symmetry is mostly s-wave with possible d-wave influence based on parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic pairing mechanism in high-temperature superconductors is crucial for advancing condensed matter physics.

Method: A two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model was simulated using constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo to study pairing symmetries in intermediate coupling.

Result: s_±-wave pairing is dominant but can be suppressed by crystal field splitting, suggesting a competition between d-wave and sₚ-wave pairing.

Conclusion: The pairing symmetry is primarily s_±-wave, influenced by parameters like Hubbard U and crystal field effects, pointing to orbital physics's role in pairing mechanisms.

Abstract: The pairing symmetry of the recently discovered bilayer nickelate
superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a subject of intense debate in condensed
matter physics, with the two leading theoretical candidates being a
sign-reversing $s_{\pm}$-wave and a $d$-wave state. To investigate its
ground-state properties in the intermediate coupling regime which is critical
for real materials, we construct a two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model and employ
the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method for large-scale simulations. By
systematically calculating ground-state pairing correlation functions across
parameter spaces, we map its pairing symmetry phase diagram. We find that an
increasing Hund's coupling selectively enhances the interlayer $s_{\pm}$-wave
pairing while suppressing the intralayer $d$-wave pairing. Similarly, a larger
crystal field splitting drives a transition from $d$-wave- to
$s_{\pm}$-wave-dominant states. Further analysis reveals that the strength of
the intralayer $d$-wave pairing is strongly correlated with the $(\pi, \pi)$
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, which are in turn effectively suppressed
by a large crystal field splitting, thereby weakening the $d$-wave pairing
channel. Additionally, the dominant pairing symmetry transition region roughly
overlaps with the inversion of orbital occupancy response to Hubbard $U$,
suggesting an intrinsic link between pairing competition and orbital physics.
Our results indicate that, within the parameter regime relevant to the actual
material, the $s_{\pm}$-wave is the most probable pairing symmetry.

Abstract: We extend the previous study of extracting crystalline symmetry-protected
topological invariants to the correlated regime. We construct the interacting
Hofstadter model defined on square lattice with the rotation and translation
symmetry defects: disclination and dislocation. The model realizes Chern
insulator and the charge density wave state as one tunes interactions.
Employing the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we calculate
the excess charge around the defects and find that the topological invariants
remain quantized in both phases, with the topological quantity extracted to
great precision. This study paves the way for utilizing matrix product state,
and potentially other quantum many-body computation methods, to efficiently
study crystalline symmetry defects on 2D interacting lattice systems.

Abstract: The development of novel quantum many-body computational algorithms relies on
robust benchmarking. However, generating such benchmarks is often hindered by
the massive computational resources required for exact diagonalization or
quantum Monte Carlo simulations, particularly at finite temperatures. In this
work, we propose a new algorithm for obtaining thermal pure quantum states,
which allows efficient computation of both mechanical and thermodynamic
properties at finite temperatures. We implement this algorithm in our
open-source C++ template library, Physica. Combining the improved algorithm
with state-of-the-art software engineering, our implementation achieves high
performance and numerical stability. As an example, we demonstrate that for the
$4 \times 4$ Hubbard model, our method runs approximately $10^3$ times faster
than $\mathcal{H}\Phi$ 3.5.2. Moreover, the accessible temperature range is
extended down to $\beta = 32$ across arbitrary doping levels. These advances
significantly push forward the frontiers of benchmarking for quantum many-body
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 石墨烯作为二维材料，在纳尺度的电子结构有望用于存储和传感技术，而双层石墨烯因其大带隙特性而被视为潜在的大容量存储材料。乘以对外磁场和电场效应的分析， частности激发配对和晶体化效应，对材料性能的优化具有重要意义。

Method: 我们通过理论建模和数值模拟，研究了双层石墨烯在垂直外磁场和不同电场作用下的能隙和电子态分布。建立了一维和二维周期性势能函数的模型，并通过动力学Thomas-Fermi方法计算系统的本征态分布。

Result: 1. 外电场和外磁场的综合作用显著影响了双层石墨烯的电子态结构和能隙大小，特别是在外磁场增加时，层内电场的贡献减小，导致能隙的总体变化。2. Wigner晶体化效应的出现是由于外磁场增强导致电子态牺牲导致的。3. 在不同自旋通道中，激发配对的能隙表现出较大的异质性。

Conclusion: 本研究为双层石墨烯的 Evening Effect提供了理论分析依据和具体的数值计算结果。我们发现，双层石墨烯在同时施加了电场和磁场后，具有很大的能隙，且在外磁场增大时，层内电场的贡献显著减小。我们还发现了Wigner晶体化效应，并通过自旋通道分析了激发配对的相对位置。这些发现为我们提供了在电子结构优化方面进行进一步研究表明的理论依据。

Abstract: In this study, we consider a two-layer graphene structure stacked in the AA
form and exposed to the influence of two different electric fields applied to
different layers. The graphene layers are also subjected to an external
magnetic field perpendicular to the planes of the layers. We investigate the
possible effects of the applied in-plane fields and the magnetic field on
excitonic pairing, antiferromagnetic order, and the chemical potential.
Simultaneously, we analyze the effects of the interlayer Coulomb interaction
potential on the physical properties of the considered system. We demonstrate
that the application of planar electric fields leads to the formation of an
unusually large bandgap in the electronic band structure, which is not typical
for AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We discuss various values of the applied
electric field potentials and show their influence on the electronic band
structure of the system. Additionally, we identify the existence of a critical
value of the magnetic field above which Wigner crystallization-like effect is
present for the electrons, also affecting the excitonic gap in one spin
channel. The results obtained in this study could be important for applications
of AA-stacked bilayer graphene as a large band-gap material.

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical Kerr effect have traditionally
been associated with ferromagnets, but recent studies reveal their presence in
noncollinear antiferromagnets due to nonzero Berry curvature despite negligible
net magnetization. However, Hall measurements often show strong temperature
dependence caused by extrinsic scattering, complicating quantitative analysis,
and temperature invariance of the Kerr effect remains unconfirmed. Here we
employ epitaxial, stoichiometric Mn3NiN single crystal films and perform polar
Kerr measurements at an infrared 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength,
demonstrating a spontaneous Kerr signal that remains stable within a few
percent across a 200 Kelvin range below the N\'eel temperature. This
temperature-invariant Kerr effect contrasts with the strongly
temperature-dependent Hall effect and confirms the intrinsic nature of Berry
curvature in these materials. Our findings establish infrared Kerr effect as a
reliable, local probe of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets,
facilitating quantitative characterization and advancing antiferromagnetic
spintronic applications.

Abstract: In isolated quantum many-body systems periodically driven in time, the
asymptotic dynamics at late times can exhibit distinct behavior such as
thermalization or dynamical freezing. Understanding the properties of and the
convergence towards infinite-time (nonequilibrium) steady states however
remains a challenging endeavor. We propose a physically motivated Krylov space
perspective on Floquet thermalization which offers a natural framework to study
rates of convergence towards steady states and, simultaneously, an efficient
numerical algorithm to evaluate infinite-time averages of observables within
the diagonal ensemble. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by
applying it to the periodically driven mixed-field Ising model, reaching system
sizes of up to 30 spins. Our method successfully resolves the transition
between the ergodic and dynamically frozen phases and provides insight into the
nature of the Floquet eigenstates across the phase diagram. Furthermore, we
show that the long-time behavior is encoded within the localization properties
of the Ritz vectors under the Floquet evolution, providing an accurate
diagnostic of ergodicity.
