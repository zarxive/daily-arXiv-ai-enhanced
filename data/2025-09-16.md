### [1] [Optical sound pressure measurement using Fabry-pérot cavity for primary acoustic standards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10480)
*Koto Hirano,Wataru Kokuyama,Hajime Inaba,Sho Okubo,Tomofumi Shimoda,Hironobu Takahashi,Keisuke Yamada,Hideaki Nozato*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optical sound pressure measurement system that surpasses traditional microphone-based methods in terms of independence for establishing acoustic standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to develop an independent acoustic measurement system arises from a desire to reduce reliance on specific microphones and improve the accuracy and reliability of sound pressure measurements.

Method: An optical system using a Fabry-pérot cavity, phase-stabilized optical frequency comb, and custom phasemeter was developed to detect changes in the air's refractive index caused by sound waves.

Result: The system demonstrated a high level of accuracy, with measurements agreeing with reference microphones within 5% at 78 and 84 dB sound pressure levels. However, a systematic deviation of 2.6% was observed, with optical measurements exceeding microphone-based ones.

Conclusion: The systematic deviation was identified to be due to fluctuations in the optical cavity caused by insufficient fixation of the mirrors. This research aims to address such issues and further enhance the system's performance.

Abstract: Optical sound pressure measurement is a promising technology to establish
primary acoustic standards without reliance on specific types of microphones.
We developed a precision optical sound pressure measurement system by combining
a Fabry-p\'erot optical cavity, a phase-stabilized optical frequency comb, and
a custom-made phasemeter. The optical cavity detects changes in the air's
refractive index induced by sound waves as changes in its resonance frequency.
A continuous-wave laser frequency is stabilized at the resonance, and the
frequency comb detects the changes in the laser frequency. The frequency
changes are measured with high sensitivity and accuracy using a phasemeter that
we developed. The sound pressures measured by this system agreed with the
measurement value obtained using a reference microphone within 5% at sound
pressure levels of 78 dB and 84 dB, within a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1
kHz. A systematic deviation of 2.6% was observed, with the optical system
yielding higher values than the microphone. To identify the cause of this
deviation, we performed vibration displacement measurements of the cavity
mirrors and finite element analysis, which revealed that fluctuations in the
optical path length due to insufficient fixation of the mirrors were
responsible.

The research focuses on the test facilities for this thruster, including a vacuum chamber with a pumping speed of 4200 L/s (Ar), a pendulum thrust-stand capable of measuring forces up to 200 mN, and software tools for coordinating the facility operations. Testing showed that the thrust stand can measure forces with a precision of approximately 1 mN and an absolute accuracy of +/-2.3 mN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to advance electric propulsion systems for spacecraft, specifically through the development of innovative thruster technologies and testing methodologies.

Method: The research employs a combination of hardware development and software implementation. Hardware includes a vacuum chamber, a pendulum thrust-stand, and auxiliary logging and control systems.

Result: The results of the research show that the AF-MPD thruster's test facilities are successfully operational. The vacuum chamber and thrust-stand are functioning as designed, and the software tools have enabled efficient coordination and data logging of the system. Initial testing of the thrust-stand demonstrated its capability to measure forces with high precision.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Robinson Research Institute has successfully established a robust test infrastructure for developing and testing the AF-MPD thruster. This infrastructure is essential for advancing electric propulsion systems for spacecraft and highlights the importance of integrating advanced hardware and software solutions in aerospace research.

Abstract: The Robinson Research Institute is developing a type of electric propulsion
for spacecraft called an applied-field magneto-plasma-dynamic (AF-MPD)
thruster. The applied field module of the thruster features a cryocooler-cooled
high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) magnet generating central fields
exceeding 1 Tesla. This paper reports on the progress to date of the thruster
test facilities established at the Institute to enable development of the
AF-MPD and electric propulsion in general. The vacuum facilities consist
primarily of a 1 m diameter, 3 m3 cylindrical chamber with a high-vacuum
pumping speed, measured to be about 4200 L/s (Ar). The chamber can be reduced
from atmospheric pressure to 1E10-5 hPa in about 2 h, enabling a rapid testing
turn-around time, and maintains 5E10-4 hPa during thruster operation at typical
mass flow rates of 5 mg/s (Ar). A pendulum thrust-stand has been purpose built
to withstands static thruster loads of up to 30 kg and measure thrust forces up
to 200 mN. It is also designed to be inherently insensitive to the unique
challenges of measuring AF-MPD with superconducting magnets; strong magnetic
fields, cryocooler vibration, and the thermal gradients. Initial thrust-stand
testing, whilst implementing both water-cooling and a cryocooler showed it to
be capable of measuring forces to a precision of approximately 1 mN and with an
absolute accuracy of +/-2.3 mN (full scale). An extensive suite of software
tools has also been developed to coordinate the large set of instruments needed
to run the vacuum facilities, the thrust-stand, HTS magnet and cryocooler in
addition to the many other auxiliary- and logging systems. Various upgrades to
the facilities are in progress or planned.

Abstract: The cooling storage ring external-target experiment is a large-scale nuclear
physics experiment, which aims to study the physics of heavy-ion collisions at
low temperatures and high baryon densities. A beam monitor (BM) is placed in
the beam line to monitor the beam status and to improve the reconstruction

stemming from the beam interactions with gases and detector materials affect
the performance of the sensors and electronics of BM. This paper uses FLUKA
Monte Carlo code to simulate the radiation environment of BM detector.
Radiation quantities including the total ionizing dose, 1 MeV neutron
equivalent fluence, high-energy hadron flux, thermal neutron flux, and nuclear
fragment flux are presented. Results of alternative simulation setups,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 如何提高侧扫声纳图像在复杂海底环境下的匹配精度和一致性成为一个重要的研究方向。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂海底环境下的侧扫声纳图像匹配中提供了数据效率高的物理可解释性解决方案，显著提升了匹配精度和配准稳定性。

Abstract: Robust matching of side scan sonar imagery remains a fundamental challenge in
seafloor mapping due to view dependent backscatter, shadows, and geometric
distortion. This paper proposes a novel matching framework that combines
physical decoupling and geometric consistency to enhance correspondence
accuracy and consistency across viewpoints. A self supervised multi branch
network, derived from the Lambertian reflection model, decomposes raw sonar
images into seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss. The
reflectivity map, serving as a stable matching domain, is used in conjunction
with a training-free matching pipeline combining SuperPoint and MINIMA
LightGlue. Geometry aware outlier rejection leverages both terrain elevation
and its physically derived shadow map to further remove mismatches in
acoustically occluded and topographically inconsistent regions, thereby
improving registration accuracy. Quantitative and visual evaluations against
traditional, CNN, and Transformer based state of the art methods demonstrate
that our method achieves lower matching error, higher geometric consistency,
and greater robustness to viewpoint variations. The proposed approach provides
a data efficient, physically interpretable solution for high precision side
scan sonar image matching in complex seafloor environments.

Result: 结果表明，使用机器学习算法可以显著提高能量重建的准确性和分辨率。

Conclusion: 结论指出，机器学习算法在处理高辐射环境下的计数器数据时，比传统的固定阈值方法更有效。

Abstract: Calorimeters operating in high-radiation environments are susceptible to
damage, leading to increased noise that can significantly degrade energy
resolution. A common way to mitigate noise is to apply a higher energy
threshold on the cells, typically set a few standard deviations above the noise
level. However, this method risks discarding cells with genuine energy
deposits, worsening the energy resolution. In this paper we explore various
machine learning (ML) algorithms that can replace a rigid threshold on the
reconstructed cell energy and we demonstrate the improvement in calorimetric
energy reconstruction and energy resolution that these ML methods can achieve
in such challenging conditions.

### [8] [Extraction of Electron and Hole Drift Velocities in thin 4H-SiC PIN Detectors using High-Frequency Readout Electronics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11918)
*Andreas Gsponer,Sebastian Onder,Stefan Gundacker,Jürgen Burin,Matthias Knopf,Daniel Radmanovac,Simon Waid,Thomas Bergauer*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the utilization of silicon carbide (SiC) in power electronics and radiation-hard particle detectors due to its thermally stable, high breakdown field, and high drift velocities. A high-frequency readout board with a 10 GHz bandwidth was developed to address limitations in charge carrier detection. Experiments on a 4H-SiC diode with UV-laser, alpha particle, and high-energy proton beam excitation show successful separation of electron and hole drift, allowing drift velocity measurements compared to literature values. A simulation environment combining TCAD, Allpix², and SPICE was also presented. Overall, the study demonstrates effective techniques for measuring and simulating charge carrier drift in SiC for advanced applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Silicon carbide has unique properties that make it ideal for high-energy applications like particle detectors and power electronics. However, existing readout electronics hinder practical implementations. This paper aims to develop advanced readout solutions to address these limitations.

Method: The authors developed a high-frequency readout board with an intrinsic bandwidth of 10 GHz. They recorded transient current signals from a 4H-SiC diode excited by UV-laser, alpha particles, and high-energy protons. Using these measurements, they separated electron and hole drift and extracted drift velocities, comparing them with Monte Carlo simulations. They also created a simulation environment integrating TCAD, Allpix², and SPICE.

Result: The experiments successfully demonstrated the separation of electron and hole drift in SiC under various excitations, enabling accurate measurement of drift velocities. The results closely matched literature values and were validated by the simulation environment.

Conclusion: The study highlights the successful development of a high-frequency readout board for SiC applications and provides a comprehensive simulation framework for future TCAD modeling. This work opens new possibilities for advanced SiC devices in power electronics and radiation detection.

Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has been widely adopted in the semiconductor industry,
particularly in power electronics, because of its high temperature stability,
high breakdown field, and fast switching speeds. Its wide band gap makes it an
interesting candidate for radiation-hard particle detectors in high-energy
physics and medical applications. Furthermore, the high electron and hole drift
velocities in 4H-SiC enable devices suitable for ultra-fast particle detection
and timing applications. However, currently, the front-end readout electronics
used for 4H-SiC detectors constitute a bottleneck in investigations of the
charge carrier drift. To address these limitations, a high-frequency readout
board with an intrinsic bandwidth of 10 GHz was developed. With this readout,
the transient current signals of a 4H-SiC diode with a diameter of 141
$\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a thickness of 50 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ upon UV-laser, alpha
particle, and high-energy proton beam excitation were recorded. In all three
cases, the electron and hole drift can clearly be separated, which enables the
extraction of the charge carrier drift velocities as a function of the electric
field. These velocities, for the first time directly measured, provide a
valuable comparison to Monte-Carlo simulated literature values and constitute
an essential input for TCAD simulations. Finally, a complete simulation
environment combining TCAD, the Allpix$^2$ framework, and SPICE simulations is
presented, in good agreement with the measured data.

TL;DR: 提出的是一种用于检测亚微电子能级粒子的新探测器概念，利用超导体的库普对的解耦原理，通过研究铌酸钡在低温下的性能，提出了一种基于电子乘数的探测器框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了探测能量水平低于常规方法可探测的亚微电子V级粒子，需要突破现有的探测技术限制。库普对解耦是一种新颖的探测原理，具有潜力，但技术瓶颈如读出灵敏度和探测器性能在低温下的表现尚未得到充分验证。因此，研究超导体材料在低温下的性能特性将为实现高灵敏度的粒子探测器奠定基础。

Method: silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) 在低温下的性能测试，包括断层电压、二次断层、工作电压范围、单光子增益和分辨率，暗计数率，输出波形特征及其相关信号的概率。

Result: 在低温下，SiPMs 的暗计数率降低了 7 个数量级，增益减少 4.44 倍。通过分析这些特性，提出了基于 PN 结的电子乘数原理的亚微电子能级粒子探测器框架。

Conclusion: 通过低温下 SiPMs 的性能优化，提出了一个新的亚微电子能级粒子探测器框架，这一成果为探测低能量粒子提供了一种潜在的技术途径。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new detector concept that uses the decoupling of
superconducting Cooper pairs to detect particles, which has a theoretical
energy threshold at the sub-meV level. However, quasiparticles decoupled from
Cooper pairs in superconductors is difficult to detect using conventional
photoelectric devices, since the binding energy of Cooper pairs is at the
sub-meV scale. A key challenge is reading out quasiparticle signals at
cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, we firstly investigate the performance of
silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at a cryogenic temperature of 10~mK, and
observed that the dark count rate drops by seven orders of magnitude compared
to room temperature, while the gain decreases by only a factor of 4.44. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of the SiPM's performance at
10~mK, including breakdown voltage, second breakdown and operating voltage
range, single-photoelectron gain and resolution, dark count rate, output
waveform characteristics, and the probability of correlated signals. Based on
these findings, we propose a conceptual framework for a sub-meV particle
detector that uses electron multiplication in a PN junction for signal readout.

Conclusion: 这项工作扩展了 _r_-matrix 理论至高亏_genus_情况，为复杂的数学物理问题提供了新工具。

Abstract: On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there
is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are
defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the
torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface
$\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector
bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of
basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at
a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be
identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with
values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple
pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of
the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is
then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed
discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also
provided.

Abstract: We demonstrate the deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonance
phenomena in two coupled identical chaotic Lorenz oscillators. Both effects are
found to occur simultaneously when varying the coupling strength. In
particular, the occurrence of deterministic coherence resonance is revealed by
analysing time realizations $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ of both oscillators, whereas the
anti-coherence resonance is identified when considering oscillations $z(t)$ at
the same parameter values. Both resonances are observed when the coupling
strength does not exceed a threshold value corresponding to complete
synchronization of the interacting chaotic oscillators. In such a case, the
coupled oscillators exhibit the hyperchaotic dynamics associated with the
on-off intermittency. The highlighted effects are studied in numerical
simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent
correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.

Abstract: Recently, a concept of deterministic and stochastic turbulence has been
introduced based on experiments with a boundary layer. A deterministic property
means that identical random perturbations at the inlet lead to identical
patterns downstream; during this stage, the non-identical, stochastic component
grows and eventually dominates the flow further downstream. We argue that these
properties can be explained by exploring the concept of convective space-time
chaos, where secondary perturbations on top of a chaotic state grow but move
away in the laboratory reference frame. We illustrate this with two simple
models of convective space-time chaos, one is a partial differential equation
describing waves on a film flowing down a plate, and the other is a set of
unidirectionally coupled ordinary differential equations. To prove convective
space-time chaos, we calculate the profiles of the convective Lyapunov
exponent. The repeatability of the turbulent field in different identical
experimental runs corresponds to the reliability of stable dynamical systems in
response to random forcing. The onset of the stochastic component is quantified
with the spatial Lyapunov exponent. We demonstrate how an effective
randomization of the field is observed when the driving is quasiperiodic.
Furthermore, we discuss space-time duality, which links sensitivity to boundary
conditions in the convective space-time chaos to the usual sensitivity to
initial conditions in a standard chaotic regime.

Conclusion: 分析表明，吸引域边界的对称性确实可能比吸引的动态系统中的对称性更高，这为理解复杂系统的几何结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates the symmetry properties of basins of attraction and
their boundaries in equivariant dynamical systems. While the symmetry groups of
compact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for
non-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We
establish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical
inclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can
strictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible
symmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches:
(i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact
attractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed
nature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity
and flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states.
Numerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results,
illustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their
common boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries
invariant. These findings reveal that basin boundaries often exhibit higher
symmetry than the attractors they separate, providing new insights into the
geometry of multistable systems and suggesting broader applications to physical
and biological models where basin structure determines stability and
predictability.

*Daniil Chernyshov,Arkady Satanin,Lev Shchur*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper examines the boundary between regular and chaotic dynamics in the generalized Chirikov map using Lyapunov exponents and a convolutional neural network. They identify how the phase shift τ affects the chaotic boundary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems, particularly identifying transitions from regular to chaotic dynamics, is crucial for various applications in physics and engineering. The use of machine learning to analyze such systems is an emerging and potentially powerful approach.

Method: The authors employed the generalized Chirikov map, computed Lyapunov exponents across parameter space (K, Kα, τ), and trained a ResNet18 model to classify dynamical regimes. The model successfully identified critical parameters for chaos and bounded regions in the parameter space for varying τ.

Result: The study discovered that as τ increases, the chaotic boundary systematically deforms, demonstrating sensitivity to phase shifts. The model effectively captures these dynamics, showing the capability of machine learning to interpret complex systems.

Conclusion: The research provides a new method for characterizing stability in nonlinear systems, highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning in analyzing chaotic behavior and phase modulation effects.

Abstract: We investigate the boundary separating regular and chaotic dynamics in the
generalized Chirikov map, an extension of the standard map with phase-shifted
secondary kicks. Lyapunov maps were computed across the parameter space (K,
K{\alpha}, {\tau} ) and used to train a convolutional neural network (ResNet18)
for binary classification of dynamical regimes. The model reproduces the known
critical parameter for the onset of global chaos in the standard map and
identifies two-dimensional boundaries in the generalized map for varying phase
shifts {\tau} . The results reveal systematic deformation of the boundary as
{\tau} increases, highlighting the sensitivity of the system to phase
modulation and demonstrating the ability of machine learning to extract
interpretable features of complex Hamiltonian dynamics. This framework allows
precise characterization of stability boundaries in nontrivial nonlinear
systems.

Abstract: Obtaining the free energies of condensed phase chemical reactions remains
computationally prohibitive for high-level quantum mechanical methods. We
introduce a hierarchical machine learning framework that bridges this gap by
distilling knowledge from a small number of high-fidelity quantum calculations
into increasingly coarse-grained, machine-learned quantum Hamiltonians. By
retaining explicit electronic degrees of freedom, our approach further enables
a faithful embedding of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that captures
long-range electrostatics and the quantum response to a classical environment
to infinite order. As validation, we compute the proton dissociation constants
of weak acids and the kinetic rate of an enzymatic reaction entirely from first
principles, reproducing experimental measurements within chemical accuracy or
their uncertainties. Our work demonstrates a path to condensed phase
simulations of reaction free energies at the highest levels of accuracy with
converged statistics.

### [16] [Assessing the Limits of Graph Neural Networks for Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium Prediction: A Cryogenic Mixture Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10565)
*Aryan Gupta*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A structure-aware graph neural network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data isn't ready for VLE calculations. While it models single-phase properties well, it struggles with phase equilibria, showing jagged P(V|T) paths and low derivative smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermophysical modeling is crucial for cryogenic systems. Accurate and efficient models are essential for design, optimization, and control. This study aims to explore the applicability of GNNs for VLE calculations, which are computationally expensive.

Method: The research employs a modified DimeNet++ (Dime-GNN) trained on data from GERG-2008 and CoolProp. The model incorporates molecular dynamics features representing molecular structure. The dataset is generated, filtered, and paired with structural data. The model is trained in two steps: pretraining on Helmholtz energy residuals, followed by pressure tuning with a stability penalty.

Result: The GNN performs well in single-phase property interpolation but fails to predict VLE equilibria. VLE calculations using GNN equilibria either default to CoolProp fallback or fail entirely. Diagnostic tools reveal issues with the smoothness of phase equilibria predictions, hindering robust solver performance.

Conclusion: The GNN-based model is not yet solver-ready for VLE applications due to inadequate handling of phase boundaries and equilibria. More refinement, such as incorporating physical priors and targeted training near phase boundaries, is needed for practical use. The study's methodological findings highlight areas for improvement in surrogate models for thermodynamic calculations.

Abstract: Accurate and fast thermophysical models are needed to embed vapor-liquid
equilibrium (VLE) calculations in design, optimization, and control loops for
cryogenic mixtures. This study asks whether a structure-aware graph neural
network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data can act as a
practical surrogate for an equation of state (EoS). We generate a ternary
dataset over 90-200 K and pressures to 100 bar, curate it with a 15% density
filter (reducing 5,200 states to 1,516), and pair each state with a lightweight
molecular-dynamics snapshot to supply structural features. The model is trained
in two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure
fine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase
interpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE
driver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates
single-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN
equilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or
the solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and
thermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating
insufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving.
An end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative
to CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond). We conclude that, as
configured, the surrogate in this study is not solver-ready for VLE and offers
no runtime benefit; its value is methodological, delineating failure modes and
pointing to remedies such as physics-informed training signals and targeted
coverage near phase boundaries.

Abstract: Ring-polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a unique mixed quantum-classical
dynamics method that seamlessly incorporates nuclear quantum effects (NQEs)
into non-adiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a
classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of
RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and
RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different
reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the
effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the
performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our results
show that the RPSH-CA method, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at
the centroid level, reliably captures NQEs and remains robust across different
reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific
intermediate and non-adiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Conversely,
adding DBOC to the conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method was
found to over-damp the dynamics significantly and reduce accuracy, especially
at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where non-adiabatic
transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers,
are generally unreliable unless in the adiabatic reaction regime and at high
temperature. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying
this erratic behavior. As such, RPSH-BA is not recommended for including NQEs
in condensed-phase non-adiabatic dynamics simulations despite its early
successful reports in 1D scattering models. Our findings clarify when geometric
corrections are beneficial or detrimental to non-adiabatic simulations using
RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.

Abstract: Ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) has become a popular method for
describing chemical reactions due to its ability to simultaneously capture
tunneling, zero-point energy, anharmonicity and recrossing. Here we highlight
that despite its many successes, great care must be taken when applying RPMD to
study gas-phase reactions at low pressure. We show that for bimolecular
reactions that proceed via pre-reactive complexes, RPMD predicts spuriously
large rates at low temperatures and pressures. Using the rigorous connection of
RPMD and semiclassical instanton theory, we demonstrate that this breakdown can
be understood in terms of an intrinsic problem with RPMD: artificial
thermalization. In the present context, this opens up reactive channels below
the reactant asymptote that should be energetically inaccessible, resulting in
erroneously large rates. We discuss practical strategies to overcome this
problem by combining the steepest-descent inverse Laplace transform with
Bleistein's uniform approximation to calculate the thermal rate given an
appropriate lower energy bound.

Abstract: Accurately modeling chemical reactions at the atomistic level requires
high-level electronic structure theory due to the presence of unpaired
electrons and the need to properly describe bond breaking and making
energetics. Commonly used approaches such as Density Functional Theory (DFT)
frequently fail for this task due to deficiencies that are well recognized.
However, for high-fidelity approaches, creating large datasets of energies and
forces for reactive processes to train machine learning interatomic potentials
or force fields is daunting. For example, the use of the unrestricted coupled
cluster level of theory has previously been seen as unfeasible due to high
computational costs, the lack of analytical gradients in many computational
codes, and additional challenges such as constructing suitable basis set
corrections for forces. In this work, we develop new methods and workflows to
overcome the challenges inherent to automating unrestricted coupled cluster
calculations. Using these advancements, we create a dataset of gas-phase
reactions containing energies and forces for 3119 different organic molecules
configurations calculated at the gold-standard level of unrestricted CCSD(T)
(coupled cluster singles doubles and perturbative triples). With this dataset,
we provide an analysis of the differences between the density functional and
unrestricted CCSD(T) descriptions. We develop a transferable machine learning
interatomic potential for gas-phase reactions, trained on unrestricted CCSD(T)
data, and demonstrate the advantages of transitioning away from DFT data.
Transitioning from training to DFT to training to UCCSD(T) datasets yields an
improvement of more than 0.1 eV/{\AA} in force accuracy and over 0.1 eV in
activation energy reproduction.

Abstract: The fermion sign problem constitutes a fundamental computational bottleneck
across a plethora of research fields in physics, quantum chemistry and related
disciplines. Recently, it has been suggested to alleviate the sign problem in
\emph{ab initio} path integral Molecular Dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo
(PIMC) calculations based on the simulation of fictitious identical particles
that are represented by a continuous quantum statistics variable $\xi$
[\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This idea facilitated a
host of applications including the interpretation of an x-ray scattering
experiment with strongly compressed beryllium at the National Ignition Facility
[\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. In the present work, we
express the original isothermal $\xi$-extrapolation method as a special case of
a truncated Taylor series expansion around the $\xi=0$ limit of distinguishable
particles. We derive new PIMC estimators that allow us to evaluate the Taylor
coefficients up to arbitrary order and we carry out extensive new PIMC
simulations of the warm dense electron gas to systematically analyze the sign
problem from this new perspective. This gives us important insights into the
applicability of the $\xi$-extrapolation method for different levels of quantum
degeneracy in terms of the Taylor series radius of convergence. Moreover, the
direct PIMC evaluation of the $\xi$-derivatives, in principle, removes the
necessity for simulations at different values of $\xi$ and can facilitate more
efficient simulations that are designed to maximize compute time in those
regions of the full permutation space that contribute most to the final Taylor
estimate of the fermionic expectation value of interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study tests the commonly held belief that solid-state diffusion is negligible at low temperatures.

Method: Isotope exchange experiments between natural barite crystals and aqueous solutions were conducted at 50 and 80°C for less than 10,360 hours.

Result: Isotope exchange rates were accurately measured, and SIMS depth profiles indicated significant 137Ba enrichment in barite.

Conclusion: The existence of defects and vacancies in barite and similar minerals supports the possibility of effective solid-state diffusion even at low temperatures, which has important implications for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, materials science, and engineering.

Abstract: The prevailing view that solid-state diffusion is negligible at low
temperatures is challenged by rapid sulfur and barium isotope exchange between
natural barite crystals and aqueous solutions in laboratory experiments. This
assumption relies on diffusivities extrapolated from high-temperature
experiments. Here, isotope exchange rates were measured in solutions enriched
with 137Ba and 32S at 50 and 80 oC for less than 10,360 hours. SIMS depth
profiles revealed 137Ba enrichment to ~75 nm, with shapes characteristic of
classical diffusion. Isotope disequilibrium between the barite surface and
aqueous solution implies a continuous supply from the interior. These results
indicate that defects and vacancies in barite and similar low-temperature
minerals enable effective solid-state diffusion, with profound implications for
paleoenvironmental reconstructions, materials science, and engineering.

Abstract: Polaritons - hybrid light-matter states formed from the strong coupling of a
bright molecular transition with a confined photonic mode - may offer new
opportunities for optical control of molecular behavior. Vibrational strong
coupling (VSC) has been reported to impact ground-state chemical reactivity,
but its influence on electronic excited-state dynamics remains unexplored.
Here, we take a first step towards excited-state VSC by demonstrating optical
modulation of the ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy), (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) complex under VSC
using femtosecond ultraviolet (UV)-pump/infrared (IR)-probe spectroscopy. We
establish ground-state VSC of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) in a microfluidic Fabry-P\'erot
cavity equipped with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated mirrors. ITO is effectively
dichroic as it is reflective in the IR and transmissive in the UV-visible and
therefore minimizes optical interference. Excitation with UV pump light drives
ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) into a manifold of electronic excited states which
subsequently undergo non-radiative relaxation dynamics. We probe the transient
response of the strongly-coupled system in the mid-IR, observing both Rabi
contraction and cavity-filtered excited state absorption signatures. We
reconstruct the intrinsic response of intracavity molecules from the transient
cavity transmission spectra to enable quantitative comparison with extracavity
control experiments. We report no changes in the excited-state dynamics of
ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) under ground-state VSC. However, we do observe significant
amplification of transient vibrational signals due to classical cavity-enhanced
optical effects. This effort lays the groundwork to pursue direct excited-state
VSC aimed at modulating photochemical reactivity.

Motivation: Investigating the accuracy and applicability of AFQMC for excited states in quantum chemistry.

Method: Applied AFQMC with EOM-CCSD trial states to calculate singlet and triplet excited states in small and medium molecules.

Result: AFQMC achieves more accurate excitation energies, especially beneficial for open-shell singlets.

Conclusion: AFQMC is a viable and efficient extension for high-accuracy calculations of low-lying excited states compared to traditional methods like EOM-CCSD.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the calculation of excited states in quantum
chemistry using auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Symmetry allows
targeting of the lowest triplet excited states in AFQMC based on restricted
open-shell determinants, effectively as a ground-state calculation. For
open-shell singlet states, excited state calculations can be stabilized with
the appropriate trial states, but their quality can have a larger effect on the
accuracy in AFQMC. We find that active space-based configuration interaction
trial states are often not sufficient to obtain accurate results. We instead
use truncated equation of motion coupled cluster with single and double
excitations (EOM-CCSD) as trial states. We benchmark the performance of these
calculations on a set of small and medium molecules and polyacenes, focusing on
predominantly single excitations. We find that the AFQMC results, obtained at a
per-sample cost scaling of $O(N^6)$, are systematically more accurate than
those obtained using EOM-CCSD, reducing excitation energy errors by
approximately half for open-shell singlets. In regimes where EOM-CC triples are
impractical, these results position AFQMC as a scalable, higher-accuracy
complement for low-lying excited states.

Abstract: Energy functions for pure and heterogenous systems are one of the backbones
for molecular simulation of condensed phase systems. With the advent of machine
learned potential energy surfaces (ML-PESs) a new era has started. Statistical
models allow the representation of reference data from electronic structure
calculations for chemical systems of almost arbitrary complexity at
unprecedented detail and accuracy. Here, kernel- and neural network-based
approaches for intramolecular degrees of freedom are combined with distributed
charge models for long range electrostatics to describe the interaction
energies of condensed phase systems. The main focus is on illustrative examples
ranging from pure liquids (dichloromethane, water) to chemically and
structurally heterogeneous systems (eutectic liquids, CO on amorphous solid
water), reactions (Menshutkin), and spectroscopy (triatomic probes for protein
dynamics). For all examples, small to medium-sized clusters are used to
represent and improve the total interaction energy compared with reference
quantum chemical calculations. Although remarkable accuracy can be achieved for
some systems (chemical accuracy for dichloromethane and water), it is clear
that more realistic models are required for van der Waals contributions and
improved water models need to be used for more quantitative simulations of
heterogeneous chemical and biological systems.

Method: The paper proposes $	extit{α-PSO}$, which integrates canonical particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with machine learning techniques. It uses mechanistically clear swarm dynamics to enhance decision-making in reaction optimisation.

Result: The $	extit{α-PSO}$ algorithm achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimisation methods. It also outperforms other methods in high-throughput experimentation campaigns by identifying optimal reaction conditions more rapidly.

Conclusion: The development of $	extit{α-PSO}$ offers chemists a powerful tool for parallel reaction optimisation, balancing interpretability with high performance while maintaining methodological clarity.

Abstract: Chemical reaction optimisation is essential for synthetic chemistry and
pharmaceutical development, demanding the extensive exploration of many
reaction parameters to achieve efficient and sustainable processes. We report
$\alpha$-PSO, a novel nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm that augments
canonical particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with machine learning (ML) for
parallel reaction optimisation. Unlike black-box ML approaches that obscure
decision-making processes, $\alpha$-PSO uses mechanistically clear optimisation
strategies through simple, physically intuitive swarm dynamics directly
connected to experimental observables, enabling practitioners to understand the
components driving each optimisation decision. We establish a theoretical
framework for reaction landscape analysis using local Lipschitz constants to
quantify reaction space "roughness", distinguishing between smoothly varying
landscapes with predictable surfaces and rough landscapes with many reactivity
cliffs. This analysis guides adaptive $\alpha$-PSO parameter selection,
optimising performance for different reaction topologies. Systematic evaluation
of $\alpha$-PSO across pharmaceutically relevant reaction benchmarks
demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art Bayesian
optimisation methods, while two prospective high-throughput experimentation
(HTE) campaigns showed that $\alpha$-PSO identified optimal reaction conditions
more rapidly than Bayesian optimisation. $\alpha$-PSO combines the predictive
capability of advanced black-box ML methods with interpretable metaheuristic
procedures, offering chemists an effective framework for parallel reaction
optimisation that maintains methodological clarity while achieving highly
performant experimental outcomes. Alongside our open-source $\alpha$-PSO
implementation, we release $989$ new high-quality Pd-catalysed Buchwald-Hartwig

Motivation: The motivation for this paper is rooted in the need to better understand the hydrodynamics of charged relativistic fluids, particularly in different phases (normal and superfluid). Previous studies have focused on specific aspects of fluid dynamics, but a unified framework that incorporates the effects of charge carriers and symmetry constraints across phases is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a field-theoretic approach that distinguishes between normal and superfluid phases based on chemical shift symmetry, providing explicit expressions for collective variables and a UV-completed description of hydrodynamic effective theories. Additionally, the introduction of a relativistic fracton fluid phase as an intermediate step between normal and superfluid phases adds novel insights into the behavior of charged relativistic fluids under varying conditions. The overall aim is to provide a comprehensive and unified description of charged relativistic fluids across phases, which can be applied to diverse physical systems such as high-energy heavy-ion collisions and early universe cosmology orders of significance, the key innovation is the distinction between normal and superfluid phases based on chemical shift symmetry.

The conclusion highlights the importance of symmetry considerations in determining the behavior of charged fluids and opens new avenues for future research in this area.

Method: The method employed in this paper involves developing a field-theoretic framework based on a complex scalar field defined on a spacelike hypersurface comoving with the fluid. The authors distinguish between normal and superfluid phases by analyzing the chemical shift symmetry in each phase. In the normal phase, the symmetry locks charges to fixed positions in the comoving plane, whereas in the superfluid phase, it relaxes to a constant shift, allowing charges to redistribute freely. The models are shown to recover the respective nonlinear hydrodynamic equations, and explicit expressions for the collective variables are derived in terms of the theory's fields. The paper also introduces a UV completion for effective field theories of hydrodynamics constructed in terms of Goldstone fields. Furthermore, a relativistic fracton fluid phase is proposed as an intermediate phase between normal and superfluid phases, characterized by a linear shift symmetry in the comoving space. Below the technical details, the key innovative aspect is the clear distinction between normal and superfluid phases based on symmetry principles, providing a unified framework for describing charged relativistic fluids across phases.

Result: The key results of this paper are: 1) A field-theoretic framework for ideal hydrodynamics of charged relativistic fluids is developed, distinguishing between normal and superfluid phases based on chemical shift symmetry. 2) The dynamics of charge-carrying fluids are constrained by symmetry in the normal phase (fixed charge positions) and relaxed in the superfluid phase (free charge redistribution). 3) Collective variables are explicitly derived in terms of the theory's fields, and the models recover the respective nonlinear hydrodynamic equations. 4) A UV completion is provided for hydrodynamic effective theories in terms of Goldstone fields. 5) A relativistic fracton fluid phase is introduced as an intermediate phase between normal and superfluid phases, with mobility governed by a linear shift symmetry. Below the technical details, the models offer a comprehensive description of the hydrodynamics of charged relativistic fluids, integrating UV information into hydrodynamic models and providing insights into diverse physical systems such as high-energy heavy-ion collisions and early universe cosmology.

Conclusion: The paper presents a significant advancement in the understanding of the hydrodynamics of charged relativistic fluids by introducing a field-theoretic framework that distinguishes between normal and superfluid phases based on symmetry considerations. The explicit derivation of collective variables and the provision of a UV-completed description of hydrodynamic effective theories offer new tools for modeling and analyzing such systems. Additionally, the introduction of a relativistic fracton fluid phase as an intermediate step between normal and superfluid phases enriches the theoretical framework and opens new avenues for future research. The results have broad implications for high-energy physics and cosmology, particularly in contexts involving extreme temperatures and densities where charged relativistic fluids play a central role.

Abstract: We propose a field-theoretic framework for ideal hydrodynamics of charged
relativistic fluids formulated in terms of a complex scalar field defined on a
spacelike hypersurface comoving with the fluid. In the normal phase, the
dynamics of charge-carrying fluids is constrained by the restrictive chemical
shift symmetry, which locks charges to fixed positions in the comoving plane as
they are transported through space by the fluid's motion. On the other hand, in
the superfluid phase, the chemical shift symmetry is relaxed to a constant
shift, allowing charges to redistribute freely across the comoving
hypersurface. We demonstrate that both models recover the respective nonlinear
hydrodynamic equations and provide explicit expressions for the collective
variables of hydrodynamics in terms of the theory's fields. Introduced models
provide a UV completion to the effective field theories of hydrodynamics
constructed in terms of the Goldstone fields. Finally, we propose a
relativistic fracton fluid phase as a natural interpolation between the normal
and superfluid phases, in which the mobility of elementary charges is
constrained by a linear shift symmetry in the comoving space.

Abstract: We study the instanton effect on the gluon scattering amplitudes at strong
coupling and large $N$ for the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
According to Alday and Maldacena, the gluon scattering amplitude corresponds
holographically to the area of a worldsheet minimal surface in the T-dual
AdS${}_5$ geometry. The Yang-Mills instanton introduces an instanton D-brane in
the geometry, with which a particular boundary condition for the minimal
surface is imposed. We show that the minimal surface undergoes a topology
change depending on the size and the gluon momenta, and that the instanton
amplitude exhibits a characteristic dependence on gluon momenta. More
specifically, we find that when the fixed instanton size modulus $\rho$ is
larger than ${\cal O}(\sqrt{\lambda}/E)$ where $\lambda$ is the 't Hooft
coupling and $E$ is the typical momentum of the scattering gluon, due to the
topology change of the worldsheet minimal surface, the instanton amplitude is
exponentially enhanced as $\exp(\rho E)$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a flexible framework based on physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for solving boundary value problems involving minimal surfaces in
curved spacetimes, with a particular emphasis on singularities and moving
boundaries. By encoding the underlying physical laws into the loss function and
designing network architectures that incorporate the singular behavior and
dynamic boundaries, our approach enables robust and accurate solutions to both
ordinary and partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions.
We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to
minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples
relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering
amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical
physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also
support both "soft" (loss-based) and "hard" (formulation-based) imposition of
boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is
promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not
limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to
boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the
natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical
role.

This introduces a correction to the covariant phase space formalism that
accounts for the configuration-dependence of the generating vector field

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the inflationary trispectrum of primordial gauge
fields generated through the scalar and tensor exchanges in models with
spectator $U(1)$ gauge fields which are kinetically coupled to the inflaton.
Focusing on the connected four-point autocorrelation function of gauge fields,
we derive exact analytical expressions for the full trispectrum of both
electric and magnetic fields using the in-in formalism and cosmological
diagrammatic rules, and explore their respective contributions in specific
momentum configurations. For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum
signal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and
reaches its maximum in the flattened limit. However, in the counter collinear
limit, we show that the non-linearity parameter associated with the trispectrum
scales quadratically with the corresponding parameter of the cross-correlation
bispectrum of magnetic fields and curvature perturbations, thereby establishing
a hierarchical relation between the higher- and lower-order correlation
functions. For the tensor exchange, the trispectrum displays a richer angular
dependence, reflecting the sensitivity to the orientation of the momentum
quadrilateral with respect to the tensor polarisation, producing characteristic
angular modulations in the trispectrum. Detecting such angular signatures in
future high-precision cosmological observations would provide a novel window
into tensor-mediated interactions in the early universe.

Abstract: We study a large class of domain wall solutions with $Mkw_3\times \Sigma^2$
and $Mkw_2\times \Sigma^3$ slices from maximal gauged supergravity in six
dimensions. $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$ are given by a Riemann surface and a
$3$-manifold with constant curvature while $Mkw_{3,2}$ denotes
three/two-dimensional Minkowski space. We consider the maximal gauged
supergravity with $CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ and $CSO(p,q,4-p-q)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^4$
gauge groups arising from an $S^1$ reduction of seven-dimensional maximal
gauged supergravity with $CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ and $CSO(p,q,4-p-q)$ gauge groups.
The two types of gauge group can be embedded in type IIA theory via consistent
truncations on $H^{p,q}\times \mathbb{R}^{5-p-q}$ and
$H^{p,q}\times\mathbb{R}^{4-p-q}\times S^1$, respectively. By performing
topological twists on $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$, we find a number of solutions
interpolating between locally flat domain walls in the UV and curved domain
walls with $Mkw_3\times \Sigma^2$ and $Mkw_2\times \Sigma^3$ slices in the IR.
Many solutions admit physical IR singularities and can be interpreted as
holographic RG flows across dimensions from five-dimensional field theories to
three- and two-dimensional non-conformal field theories in the IR. Upon
uplifted to type IIA theory, we expect the solutions to describe brane
configurations involving D4-branes wrapped on $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$.

### [34] [Quantum state spectrum and field theory of D$0$-brane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11324)
*Igor Bandos,Unai D. M. Sarraga,Mirian Tsulaia*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper discusses the quantization of the D$0$-brane and its quantum state spectrum within the spinor moving frame formalism. It aims to prepare for the quantization of multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) and introduces a superfield describing the massive supermultiplet obtained from Kaluza-Klein modes of eleven-dimensional supergravity. The paper also hints at its relevance to developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculations using on-shell superfields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper appears to be part of a broader effort to understand the quantization of D-branes, particularly the D$0$-brane, within the context of string theory and supergravity. The analysis of the quantum state spectrum could provide insights into the structure of higher-dimensional brane systems and their implications for string theory.

Method: The authors use a covariant quantization approach within the spinor moving frame formalism, building upon existing literature on D$0$-branes but introducing new elements such as the superfield description and the spinor helicity formalism.

Result: The key results include the description of the quantum state vector as an on-shell superfield and the identification of this superfield with the massive supermultiplet from Kaluza-Klein compactifications. This provides a new perspective on the connection between D$0$-branes and higher-dimensional supergravity theories, furthering the understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence and related dualities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by suggesting the potential applications of the developed formalism in constructing string theory amplitudes based on on-shell superfields, which could be a stepping stone for future research in string theory and its related dualities.

Abstract: We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of
supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and
analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for
quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model,
which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism,
this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10
D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed
and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
  We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an
on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the
linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as
massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven
dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly
discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of
the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus
based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.

Abstract: Scalar fields in 4D are known to have equivalent dual descriptions in terms
of form-field gauge potentials, but this is often regarded as an arcane fact.
Why use more complicated formulations when simpler scalar descriptions exist
and are equivalent? We describe three ways in which scalars that arise as duals
can differ from their garden-variety counterparts. Two of these -- the
interchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological
information to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these
we add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative
interactions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that
quantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving
gravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit,
the non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to
be suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed. They are
nonetheless technically natural, as is particularly clear in the dual
formulation. We argue that scalar fields arising as duals (such as the
universal axion $a$ from string vacua) that have the commonly assumed $J^\mu
\partial_\mu a$ interaction with matter also have $J^\mu J_\mu$ contact
interactions among the respective currents, some of whose implications we
explore. We also emphasize the non-trivial role and cosmological implications
of non-propagating 3-form gauge potentials and clarify confusing statements
recently made in the literature regarding the validity of duality for massive
form fields.

Joule-Thomson expansion behaviors in such noncommutative backgrounds.
Concretely, we find that the critical universal numbers X_N can be expressed as
X_0 + NX, where N is the quintessence parameter and X_0 is the critical
universal number of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black holes in a NC spacetime
without additional external fields. Furthermore, we find that Van der Waals
behaviors can be recovered by strictly constraining the charge in terms of
external parameters. To conclude this work, we compute and examine the
deflection angle of lights in such a modified spacetime geometry.

Abstract: Vacuum polarisation effects induced by the sourceless solutions of the
Yang-Mills equation are investigated. These solutions represent oppositely
oriented chromomagnetic flux tubes permeating the space in all directions. We
review and prove the gauge invariance of the effective Lagrangian on sourceless
gauge fields and present a number of alternative methods allowing to compute
the effective Lagrangian. We compute the effective Lagrangian on chromomagnetic
flux tube solutions and demonstrate that the effective Lagrangian has a
universal form that supports the stability of the chromomagnetic flux tubes
condensation and indicates that the Yang-Mills vacuum is a highly degenerate
state. The stability is a result of the quartic nonlinear self-interaction of
the negative mode completely eliminating the instability and the imaginary term
from the effective Lagrangian in chromomagnetic field. It is suggested that the
condensate of chromomagnetic flux tubes represents a dual analog of the Cooper
pairs condensate in a superconductor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the cosmological viability of bumblebee models through their perturbative structure is crucial for testing viable dark energy models.

Method: Analyzing scalar and tensor perturbations of bumblebee models, deriving conditions for ghost-modes suppression and evaluating perturbation spectra.

Result: Non-minimal coupling stabilizes bumblebee models; de Sitter solutions emerge with suppressed scalar sound speed, offering potential observational signatures.

Conclusion: Bumblebee models with non-minimal coupling provide an interesting alternative to $m oxed{m m m m m m m m m}$ for dark energy.

Abstract: Bumblebee models, a class of vector-tensor theories in which a vector field
acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks spacetime
symmetries, are ubiquitous in the literature. In this paper, we highlight
several often-overlooked properties of these models by analyzing their
cosmological perturbations. We show that a non-minimal coupling to gravity is
essential for the stability of the setup. However, avoiding propagation of a
ghost mode then requires imposing a relation between the coupling coefficients,
known as the degeneracy condition, which reduces the bumblebee model to a
subset of generalized Proca theories with a marginal non-minimal operator. By
imposing the degeneracy condition, the vector field becomes non-dynamical at
the background level, and the form of its potential is completely fixed in
vacuum. We show that the vacuum expectation value of the vector field can drive
a de Sitter solution, for which the effects of the non-minimal coupling are
negligible at the background level but provide essential order-one corrections
to the sound speed of the scalar mode, keeping the setup weakly coupled at the
level of perturbations. Treating this stealth de Sitter solution as a dark
energy candidate, we study its coupling to matter and find the effective
gravitational coupling for the matter density contrast in the quasi-static
regime. At the level of perturbations, the system behaves differently from
$\Lambda$CDM, providing a potential observational signature to distinguish the
two models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research proposes a novel framework using magnetic quivers to study complex brane setups and their associated supersymmetric theories, aiming to uncover deeper insights into the structure of these theories.

Method: The methodology involves analyzing brane moves in Type IIB setups with O3 planes, constructing orthosymplectic $
ot	ext{N}=4$ magnetic quivers, and utilizing tools like supersymmetric indices, Hilbert series, and fugacity maps to deduce global gauge group data that isn't directly observable from brane configurations alone.

Result: The study successfully constructs magnetic quivers for various examples, revealing the maximal branches of the theories under investigation. This approach not only matches known moduli spaces but also pinpoints previously inaccessible global gauge group structures.

Conclusion: The proposed magnetic quiver framework successfully captures the maximal branches of the studied theories. This work bridges the gap between brane configurations and global gauge group data, highlighting the potential of magnetic quivers in advancing our understanding of 3d Chern-Simons matter theories with high supersymmetry.

Abstract: A magnetic quiver framework is proposed for studying maximal branches of 3d
orthosymplectic Chern-Simons matter theories with $\mathcal{N} \geq 3$
supersymmetry, arising from Type IIB brane setups with O3 planes. These
branches are extracted via brane moves, yielding orthosymplectic
$\mathcal{N}=4$ magnetic quivers whose Coulomb branches match the moduli spaces
of interest. Global gauge group data, inaccessible from brane configurations
alone, are determined through supersymmetric indices, Hilbert series, and
fugacity maps. The analysis is exploratory in nature and highlights several
subtle features. In particular, magnetic quivers are proposed as predictions
for the maximal branches in a range of examples. Along the way, dualities and
structural puzzles are uncovered, reminiscent of challenges in 3d mirror
symmetry with orientifolds.

Abstract: This work considers how exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy formula affect the thermodynamic behavior of the FLRW cosmological
model. These corrections drastically change the form of the Friedman field
equations inducing non-trivial phase transition behavior. For negative values
of the trace parameter $\alpha$, the system presents first-order phase
transitions above the critical temperature, and for positive $\alpha$, the
system undergoes a reentrant phase transition. As these corrections are
presumably relevant at the early Universe stage, to corroborate the presence of
some potential vestige of this contribution in the current era, a study has
been carried out comparing observational data and current values of the Hubble
parameter.

Abstract: We study a class of infinite-distance loci, referred to as K-points, in
one-parameter complex-structure moduli spaces of type IIB string theory
compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show that around K-points the
effective four-dimensional supergravity exhibits certain unusual properties.
The two most prominent being that the leading order dependence of the
prepotential on the gauge couplings is non-perturbative and that the leading
gauge kinetic terms in the action vanish when evaluated on an anti self-dual
graviphoton background. These properties are shared with the conifold locus in
moduli space, rather than the large complex-structure locus. The conifold locus
is well-known to arise from integrating out a charged BPS state, and so the
similarities suggest that the K-point also arises from integrating out a BPS
state. We develop such an interpretation, finding that it corresponds to a BPS
state which is extremely light, whose mass in Planck units is
doubly-exponentially small in the distance to the K-point. The state behaves as
if it had complex charges, or as if it couples to the self-dual and anti
self-dual parts of the graviphoton differently. Assuming such an
integrating-out scenario is indeed the correct physics for the K-point, we
discuss the implications for our understanding of infinite distances in moduli
space and for the Swampland Distance Conjecture.

Result: 所有32个区域的贡献都可以表示为Γ函数，最终结果仅由交叉比对数表示。

Conclusion: 该方法显著简化了计算过程，得到了干净的闭式解。

Abstract: We apply the method of regions to the evaluation of dual conformal integrals
with small off-shellness. In contrast to conventional approach, where the
separation of regions is performed via dimensional regularization which breaks
the dual conformal invariance (DCI) of separate contributions, we use the
regularization which is sufficiently generic combination of dimensional and
analytic regularizations which preserves the DCI. Within this regularization,
the contribution of each region becomes DCI. We show that our method
dramatically simplifies the calculations. As a demonstration, we calculate a
slightly off-shell DCI pentabox integral up to power corrections. The
contributions of all 32 regions appear to be expressible in terms of
$\Gamma$-functions thus giving, after removing the regularization, the final
expression in terms of cross-ratios logarithms only. We have checked that our
result for pentabox integral numerically agrees with the result of the recent
Belitsky&Smirnov paper [arXiv:2508.14298] which has essentially more
complicated form.

Abstract: We develop a framework based on modern amplitude techniques to analyze
emission and absorption effects in black hole physics, including Hawking
radiation. We first discuss quantum field theory on a Schwarzschild background
in the Boulware and Unruh vacua, and introduce the corresponding $S$-matrices.
We use this information to determine on-shell absorptive amplitudes describing
processes where a black hole transitions to a different mass state by absorbing
or emitting quanta, to all orders in gravitational coupling. This on-shell
approach allows for a universal description of black holes, with their
intrinsic differences encapsulated in the discontinuities of the amplitudes,
without suffering from off-shell ambiguities such as gauge freedom.
Furthermore, the absorptive amplitudes serve as building blocks to describe
physics beyond that of isolated black holes. As applications, we find that the
Hawking thermal spectrum is well understood by three-point processes. We also
consider a binary system and compute the mass shift of a black hole induced by
the motion of a companion object, including quantum effects. We show that the
mean value of the mass shift is classical and vacuum-independent, while its
variance differs depending on the vacuum choice. Our results provide
confirmation of the validity of the on-shell program in advancing our
understanding of black hole physics.

Abstract: We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for
toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization
techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the
$R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the
on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate
specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate
index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln
|c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan
type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$,
and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples.
Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to
multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.

Abstract: We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product
orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT
$\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and
maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one
fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only
symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are
invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways.
First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion
categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect
lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric
product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series
$\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our
results for holography.

characterize the quantum polarization and entanglement within the final state.
These quantities can be expressed in any inertial frame by arbitrary, built-in
Lorentz transformations.

Abstract: Correlators of affine Kac-Moody currents evaluate to a sum over
multi-color-trace contributions. We present a `single-trace current system'
defined on a genus 0 Riemann surface, whose correlators evaluate to precisely
the single-trace term in the evaluation of a standard affine Kac-Moody at level
1. We demonstrate that using the single-trace current system in genus 0
Berkovits-Witten twistor string correlators gives pure $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super
Yang-Mills tree amplitudes, and explain how this works both at the level of the
string theory correlator and from the perspective of the effective field
theory. We explain how using the single-trace current system in genus 0
correlators of the ambitwistor string gives pure Yang-Mills tree amplitudes,
and briefly discuss a proposal to go to higher loops.

Abstract: We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in
heterotic supergravity, which includes the
Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In
particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and
compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to
the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution,
which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to
make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the
multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr
solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments
are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory
at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of
four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish
traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.

### [50] [A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21823)
*Guglielmo Grimaldi,Matthew Headrick,Veronika E. Hubeny*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: New research shows that certain inequalities related to entanglement entropies are present in both the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) and Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) entropy calculations, providing evidence that these two methods produce the same results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the similarities and differences between RT and HRT entropy calculations is crucial for validating their applications in quantum gravity.

Method: The research employs Markov states to test whether the entropy inequalities hold true for both RT and HRT formulas.

Result: The tests confirm that RT entropy inequalities are fulfilled by HRT calculations, suggesting that both methods generate the same entropy cone.

Conclusion: This study offers compelling evidence that the RT and HRT entropy cones are identical, which is significant for theoretical physics in understanding quantum spacetime.

Abstract: Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula
are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the
so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently
the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those
same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant
Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has
accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this
conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that
a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to
evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly,
only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence
that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new
characterization of that cone.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to provide a deeper understanding of the Saint-Venant compatibility equations and their application in deformation theory.

Conclusion: This paper enhances the intuitive understanding of the Saint-Venant compatibility equations and their significance in deformation theory.

Abstract: This paper examines the intuitive meaning of the Saint--Venant compatibility

*Subhankar Khatua,Griffin C. Howson,Michel J. P. Gingras,Jeffrey G. Rau*

TL;DR: The paper discusses a phenomenon called order by quantum disorder (ObQD) in frustrated magnetic systems, where quantum fluctuations stabilize a unique ordered state despite having many classical ground states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ObQD is important for frustrated spin systems, as it explains how quantum effects can lead to long-range order in systems where classical physics alone cannot.

Method: The authors use exact diagonalization (ED) calculations and an effective quantum rotor model to study ObQD. They analyze the crossover from delocalized to localized states and relate energy splittings to ObQD selection energy scales.

Result: The paper successfully applies their method to various frustrated spin models, demonstrating the general applicability of the approach in one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems.

Conclusion: This work provides a new framework for identifying and studying ObQD, which can be applied across different spatial dimensions and frustrated spin models.

Abstract: In frustrated magnetic systems with a subextensive number of classical ground
states, quantum zero-point fluctuations can select a unique long-range ordered
state, a celebrated phenomenon referred to as \emph{order by quantum disorder}
(ObQD). For frustrated spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems, unbiased numerical methods
able to expose ObQD are necessary. We show that ObQD can be identified from
exact diagonalization (ED) calculations through an analysis akin to the
Anderson tower of states associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. By
defining an effective quantum rotor model, we describe the competition between
ObQD-induced localization of the rotor and its tunneling between
symmetry-related ground states, identifying the crossover lengthscale from the
finite-size regime where the rotor is delocalized, to the infinite system-size
limit where it becomes localized. This rotor model relates the characteristic
splittings in the ED energy spectrum to the ObQD selection energy scale,
providing an estimate that can be compared to spin wave calculations. We
demonstrate the general applicability of this approach in one-, two- and
three-dimensional frustrated spin models that exhibit ObQD.

Abstract: Understanding the excitations of quantum materials is essential for
unraveling how their microscopic constituents interact. Among these,
particle-hole excitations form a particularly important class, as they govern
fundamental processes such as screening, dissipation, and transport. In metals,
the continuum of electron-hole excitations is described by the Lindhard
function. Although central to the theory of Fermi liquids, the corresponding
Lindhard continuum has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report its
direct observation in the weakly correlated metal MgB$_{2}$ using ultra-soft
resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). We resolve a linearly dispersing
excitation with velocity comparable to the Fermi velocity and find quantitative
agreement with simulations of the non-interacting charge susceptibility. A
detailed analysis and decomposition of the simulations reveal the intra-band
origin of this low-energy excitation, confirming it as the Lindhard continuum.
Our results establish ultra-soft RIXS as a momentum-resolved probe of the
fermiology in metals and call for deeper investigations of continuum features
in RIXS and related spectroscopy of other materials beyond MgB$_{2}$.

Abstract: We use the numerically unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method
to systematically investigate the three-orbital Emery model in the normal state
in a wide range of local interactions, charge transfer energy, and doping
levels. We focus on the influence of the onsite Hubbard $U_{dd}$ and charge
transfer energy scale $\epsilon_p$ on the electronic properties via the orbital
occupancies, local moments, spin correlations, and spectral properties. Rich
features of the orbital-resolved local and momentum-dependent spectra are
revealed to associate with the possible Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS) breakdown
reflected by the peak splitting near the Fermi level in the heavily overdoped
regime. Moreover, the pseudogap features at small charge transfer energy scale
(relevant to cuprates) are shown to diminish at larger $\epsilon_p$, which
implies the weakening or absence of the pseudogap in the infinite-layer
nickelates. Besides, an optimal value of $\epsilon_p$ is identified for
maximizing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin correlations. Our large-scale
simulations provide new insights on the well-established Emery model,
particularly in the regime of heavily overdoped and/or large charge transfer
energy scale.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We synthesize the high-quality Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ single crystal and investigate
its lowtemperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties. Below $T\rm_{N}$ =
1.08 K, the anisotropic behavior of magnetic susceptibilities reveals that the
Gd$^{3+}$ moments exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic coupling along the
$c$-axis, while displaying a ferromagnetic arrangement in kagome plane. With
pronounced magnetic frustration, in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration
experiments starting from initial conditions of 9 T and 2 K, Gd$_3$BWO$_9$
polycrystal reaches a minimum temperature of 0.151 K, significantly lower than
its $T\rm_{N}$. Due to the high density of Gd$^{3+}$ ions ($S$=7/2), the
maximum magnetic entropy change reaches over 50 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ under
fields up to 7 T in Gd$_3$BWO$_9$, nearly 1.5 times as large as commercial
sub-Kelvin magnetic coolant Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$(GGG). The H-T phase diagram of
Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ under $H$//$c$ exhibits field-induced critical behavior near the
phase boundaries. This observation aligns with the theoretical scenario in
which a quantum critical point acts as the endpoint of a line of classical
second-order phase transitions. Such behavior suggests the importance of
further investigations into the divergence of magnetic Gr\"uneisen parameter in

Abstract: Rare-earth (RE) based frustrated magnets have attracted great attention as
excellent candidates for magnetic refrigeration at sub-Kelvin temperatures,
while the experimental identification on systems exhibiting both large
volumetric cooling capacity and reduced working temperatures far below 1 K
remain to be a challenge. Here, through the ultra-low temperature magnetism and
thermodynamic characterizations, we unveil the large magnetocaloric effect
(MCE) realized at sub-Kelvin temperatures in the frustrated Kagome
antiferromagnet Gd3BWO9 with TN~1.0 K. The isothermal magnetization curves
indicate the existence of field (B) induced anisotropic magnetic phase
diagrams, where four distinct magnetic phases for B // c-axis and five magnetic
phases for B // ab-plane are identified at T< TN. The analysis of magnetic
entropy S(B, T) data and direct adiabatic demagnetization tests reveal a
remarkable cooling performance at sub-Kelvin temperatures featured by a large
volumetric entropy density 502.2 mJ/K/cm3 and a low attainable minimal
temperature Tmin~168 mK from the initial cooling condition of 2 K and 6 T,
surpassing most of Gd-based refrigerants previously documented in temperature
ranges of 0.25-4 K. The realized Tmin~168 mK far below TN ~ 1.0 K in Gd3BWO9 is
related to the combined effects of magnetic frustration and
criticality-enhanced MCE, which together leave a substantial magnetic entropy
at reduced temperatures by enhancing spin fluctuations.

Abstract: We studied formation of charge density wave between valleys in a system with
a double-well-like dispersive valence band relevant for the rhombohedral
graphene trilayer. In a regime with 2 Fermi surfaces, electron- and hole-like:
one of radius $p_i$, another of $p_o$, an instability in particle-hole channel
appears at $q=q_c+\delta q$, where $q_c=p_o-p_i$. In a weak coupling regime
($x/\epsilon_F\ll 1$) presence of an additional energy scale $\propto m
q_c\delta q$ gives rise to several regimes with distinct spectrum and transport
properties: in a regime with small order parameter $x\lessapprox m p_F \delta
q$ Fermi arcs show up and substantially change conductance. At larger values of
the order parameter Fermi arcs are gapped out. Regimes are also distinguished
by different effective exponents $\gamma$ in conductance correction
$\sigma\propto \tau_D^\gamma$ where $\tau_D$ is scattering time off disorder

Conclusion: 结果表明，通过Kondo耦合驱动的相变和复杂相图提供了新的见解。通过计算和标度论证，证实了这些相变的存在。

Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on chains of Co
adatoms on Cu surfaces, we investigate the physics of a spin-$3/2$ Heisenberg
chain with single-ion anisotropy ($D$) on metallic and semi-metallic surfaces.
In the strong Kondo coupling ($J_k$) limit, a perturbative analysis maps the
system onto a Haldane spin-1 chain with single-ion anisotropy,
ferromagnetically coupled to the metallic surface. This Haldane state, arising
from underscreening of the $S=3/2$ chain, is stable against small $D$ and
characterized by topological edge modes. The nature of the $D$-driven
transitions out of this state depends on the environment. Coupling to a metal
(semi-metal) is a relevant (irrelevant) perturbation at the decoupled fixed
point between the spin-1 chain and the two-dimensional electron gas. In the
large positive $D$ limit, the system maps onto an anisotropic spin-$1/2$ Kondo
system. For large negative $D$, in the Ising phase, spins are frozen. For small
$J_k$, the nature of the metallic phase dominates. On a two-dimensional
semi-metal, the Kondo coupling is irrelevant at the decoupled fixed point
($J_k= 0$), leading to a Kondo breakdown phase at weak coupling, irrespective
of $D$. In contrast, on a two-dimensional metal, the resulting dissipative
Ohmic bath is a marginally relevant perturbation, inducing antiferromagnetic
ordering along the chain. In this case, $D$ drives a spin-flop transition
between Ising and XY ordered phases. At $D=0$, we observe continuous
transitions between the Kondo breakdown or dissipation-induced long-range
ordered phases and the underscreened Haldane phase. These phase diagrams are
supported by scaling arguments and sign-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte
Carlo simulations.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study investigates the effect of hyperfine interactions in TmVO4 crystals on the electronic ferroquadrupole order and its phase transition under thermal fields, predicting a quantum phase transition with a back-bending phase boundary, described by a single-ion model, and suggesting potential nuclear magnetic order under strain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of hyperfine interactions in low-dimensional quantum systems is crucial for exploring exotic magnetic and quantum phase transitions, with implications for both fundamental science and potential spintronic applications.

Method: The researchers employed a single-ion semiclassical mean-field model to analyze the hyperfine coupling between Tm³⁺ nuclear and ⁴f electrons, mapping out the phase diagram and predicting the phase transition behavior under external fields.

Result: The study successfully demonstrated that hyperfine coupling within Tm³⁺ ions modifies the critical field for the electronic ferroquadrupole order, leading to a significant shift (back-bending) of the phase boundary. Additionally, through effective Hamiltonian analysis, the researchers identified conditions under which spontaneous nuclear magnetic order can emerge, potentially resulting in a tetracritical point under applied strain.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how hyperfine interactions influence the electronic and magnetic properties of Tm VO4 crystals, paving the way for future explorations of similar phenomena in other rare-earth-based materials.

Abstract: Hyperfine interactions couple nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. The
present work explores how hyperfine coupling within the Tm ions in TmVO$_4$
single crystals affects an electronic ferroquadrupole ordered ground state and
its associated field-tuned quantum phase transition. For temperatures below the
hyperfine energy scale, the nuclear moments reduce the critical field for the
electronic order, resulting in a dramatic back-bending of the phase boundary
delineating the ferroquadrupole order. This behavior is well described by a
single-ion semiclassical mean-field model. Moreover, analysis of the effective
Hamiltonian leads to a prediction of spontaneous nuclear magnetic order
mediated by 4$f$ electrons, which in principle persists with the application of
orthogonal antisymmetric strain, yielding a proposed electro-nuclear
tetracritical point.

Result: 结果表明，当自旋量子数S为3/2和2时，基态表现出磁滞 Abrupt的变化；随着S的增加，磁滞行为趋于唯一性，保持特定磁化率。研究还发现了磁滞间隙和费米子激发的共存。

Conclusion: 结果为理解量子自旋系统和量子计算提供了新视角，支持使用自旋系统作为量子计算资源，并扩展了量子自旋流体的理论。

Abstract: We generalize the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model to a spin-\(S\)
ferromagnetic model with exactly-written ground states, known as the
partially-magnetized valence bond solid (VBS) states with magnetization
$m=(S-1)/S$.
  We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with
magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos
method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG).
  However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely
determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$.
  This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum
entanglement inherent in VBS states.
  In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane
gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation.
  This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field.
  Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum
computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture.

Abstract: Femtosecond laser control of antiferromagnetic order is a cornerstone for
future memory and logic devices operating at terahertz clock rates. The advent
of altermagnets -- antiferromagnets with unconventional spin-group symmetries
-- creates new opportunities in this evolving field. Here, we demonstrate
ultrafast laser-induced switching in altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe that
orchestrates the concerted dynamics of charge, lattice, and spin degrees of

the transient melting of spin order is accompanied by pronounced structural and
electronic instabilities, as evidenced by phonon nonlinearity and accelerated
band gap shrinkage. Theoretical modeling highlights the key roles of robust
magnetic correlations and spin-charge coupling pathways intrinsic to this

Abstract: We report a neutron diffraction study of the magnetic structure of CeAlGe, a
candidate topological semimetal that hosts a non-collinear, multi-$\mathbf{k}$
magnetic phase. By measuring both low- and high-momentum-transfer magnetic
Bragg peaks within a single experimental setup, we refine a magnetic structure
model based solely on localized Ce moments. This model, which differs from that
obtained using only high-$Q$ data, quantitatively reproduces the observed
intensities, including the $(000)$ zeroth-order magnetic satellites that are
especially sensitive to subtle components of the modulation. While a
contribution from itinerant electrons to the zeroth satellite cannot be
definitively excluded, our analysis reveals no unambiguous evidence for such
effects within experimental uncertainty. The refined magnetic structures
exhibit topologically nontrivial winding patterns, derived from the fitted
magnetic parameters, that support localized, particle-like spin textures with
half-integer topological charges. These features provide a natural microscopic
origin for the observed topological Hall effect, establishing CeAlGe as a model
system where magnetism and topology are intimately linked.

Motivation:  quantum networks are essential for distributed quantum applications with strict performance requirements, and effective control in near-term architectures with constrained hardware is crucial for their feasibility. Quantum network dynamics can be modeled as Markov decision processes, making dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL) promising for optimizing control strategies.

Conclusion:  significant contribution to the field of quantum network control by introducing an RL framework capable of optimizing non-linear objectives, validated through practical application in entanglement distillation.

Abstract: Optimized control of quantum networks is essential for enabling distributed
quantum applications with strict performance requirements. In near-term
architectures with constrained hardware, effective control may determine the
feasibility of deploying such applications. Because quantum network dynamics
are suitable for being modeled as a Markov decision process, dynamic

optimizing control strategies. However, key quantum network performance
measures -- such as secret key rate in quantum key distribution -- often
involve a non-linear relationship, with interdependent variables that describe
quantum state quality and generation rate. Such objectives are not easily
captured by standard RL approaches based on additive rewards. We propose a
novel RL framework that directly optimizes non-linear, differentiable objective
functions, while also accounting for uncertainties introduced by classical
communication delays. We evaluate this framework in the context of entanglement
distillation between two quantum network nodes equipped with multiplexing

non-linear objective function optimization in quantum networks with RL, opening

TL;DR: We propose a quantum-classical algorithm, E-FCFW, for decomposing graphs into a weighted sum of few matchings, addressing challenges in network resource allocation. We benchmark it on different graph types using various simulators and quantum hardware, showing superior performance in terms of sparsity and approximation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network resource allocation, especially in peer-to-peer energy exchange, poses significant challenges for classical algorithms. Quantum-classical approaches offer a promising solution, particularly for optimization problems like graph decomposition.

Method: E-FCFW extends the Fully-Corrective Frank-Wolfe algorithm by incorporating a matching-sampling subroutine implemented using QAOA. We used Qiskit Aer simulators and IBM Kingston quantum hardware to validate our approach on complete, bipartite, and heavy-hex graphs.

Result: On small complete and bipartite graphs, E-FCFW with QAOA achieves sparser decompositions compared to random sampling and simulated annealing. For larger heavy-hex graphs, it provides better approximation errors, even when using quantum hardware.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that quantum subroutines can enhance classical algorithms, offering a viable direction for future quantum-classical collaborations in solving complex network optimization problems.

Abstract: We study the problem of decomposing a graph into a weighted sum of a small
number of graph matchings. This problem arises in network resource allocation
problems such as peer-to-peer energy exchange, and it is challenging to solve
with current classical algorithms even for small instances. To address this
problem, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, E-FCFW, based on the
Fully-Corrective Frank-Wolfe (FCFW) algorithm. In particular, E-FCFW extends
FCFW by incorporating a matching-sampling subroutine that can be carried out
classically or with a quantum approach. We show how to design such a subroutine
using QAOA, which aims at solving a constrained discrete optimisation problem
approximately to obtain solution-variety. We benchmark our approach on
complete, bipartite, and heavy-hex graphs, conducting experiments using the
Qiskit Aer state-vector simulator (9-25 qubits), the Qiskit Aer MPS simulator
(52-76 qubits) and on IBM Kingston (52-111 qubits), demonstrating performance
at a utility-scale quantum hardware level. Our results show that E-FCFW with
QAOA consistently yields sparser decompositions (mean and median) than the
other methods (random sampling and simulated annealing) for small complete and
bipartite graphs. For large heavy-hex graphs with 50 and 70 nodes, E-FCFW with
QAOA also outperforms the other methods in terms of approximation error. Our
findings highlight a promising role for quantum subroutines in classical
algorithms.

Abstract: Reduced abstract. This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in
collective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum
emitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures,
focusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay
among quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a
rich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been
widely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters
modelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting
superradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly
connecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to
the Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical
studies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity,
photon statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology.
The sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving
strength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging.
Unexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population
through dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we
develop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We
also analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying
five mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced
here. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables
scalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as
quantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous
broadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing
cooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies.

Abstract: In this work we address the contemporary debate about quantum individuality
expressed as an opposition between those who, like D\'ecio Krause, defend the
reference of the theory to "non-individual particles", and those like Dennis
Dieks, who propose instead to preserve the notion of "classical particle" as
commonly applied by contemporary physicists. We will argue that these
viewpoints rather than truly opposed share a common methodology which has
helped to reinforce the doctrine of classical concepts that was imposed by Bohr
and Dirac within the "standard" formulation --which remains the orthodox
physical account of the theory of quanta. We will also discuss a recently
proposed relativist yet objective relational account of quantum individuality
[25] which, going back to Einstein's methodological approach, opens the doors
to a completely new, truly realist understanding of quantum individuality.

Abstract: Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure,
non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body
states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any
nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the
Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a
doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the
transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies
maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length
$2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we
prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices
$\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion
systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the
universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory
scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries
at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.

TL;DR: Spin glasses can exhibit associative memory, surpassing the Hopfield limit when driven-dissipative dynamics are applied.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Storing too many memories in Hopfield models leads to frustration in spin glasses. However, quantum-optical, nonequilibrium dynamics can enhance memory capabilities.

Method: Experiments were conducted with a driven-dissipative spin glass comprising atoms and photons.

Result: Observed that the spin glass's associative memory exceeds the Hopfield limit significantly.

Conclusion: Implications for quantum prosthetics in learning and memory.

Abstract: The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using
all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium
dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process
because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise
as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin
glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium
dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We
experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a
driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses
the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion
boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term
synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a
quantum-optical system.

Abstract: Simulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories in nature is
challenging with classical methods, but is a promising application for quantum
computers. Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high
boson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with
truncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum
computer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic,
and mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for
simulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a
hybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in
the internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states.
Specifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa
model, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure
fermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high
bosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental
results capture well such high-occupation states. This simulation approaches
the regime where classical methods become challenging, bypasses the need for a
large qubit overhead, and removes truncation errors. Our results, therefore,
open the way to achieving demonstrable quantum advantage in qubit-boson quantum
computing.

TL;DR:  Deep ensembles can improve quantum parameter estimation by providing uncertainty quantification and better resilience to noise, needing less data than Bayesian methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Quantum parameter estimation is vital for quantum computing applications, and Bayesian inference is a leading method. However, uncertainty quantification and robustness to noise are crucial advantages.

Method:  Deep ensembles are used as an alternative to Bayesian inference. They employ ensembles of deep neural networks to enhance robustness and quantify uncertainty.

Result:  Deep ensembles offer superior noise resilience and require less data compared to Bayesian methods, approaching the ultimate precision limit.

Conclusion:  Deep ensembles provide an efficient and effective approach for quantum parameter estimation, leveraging their ability to account for uncertainty and handle noise.

Abstract: We show that ensembles of deep neural networks, called deep ensembles, can be
used to perform quantum parameter estimation while also providing a means for
quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates, which is a key advantage of
using Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. These models are shown to be
more robust to noise in the measurement results used to perform the parameter
estimation as well as noise in the data used to train them. We also show that
much less data is needed to achieve comparable performance to Bayesian
inference based estimation, which is known to reach the ultimate precision
limit as more data is collected, than was used in previous proposals.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how the QCM method can accurately estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on a IBM quantum device, with errors lower than those from direct VQE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to evaluate non-energetic properties of chemical systems using quantum devices, particularly in the context of near-term quantum computing applications.

Method: The authors use the Quantum computed moments (QCM) method, based on the Lanczos cluster expansion, to estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on a Superconducting Quantum Device.

Result: The noise-mitigated QCM results agree with full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations to within 0.03 ± 0.007 debye, compared to 0.07 ± 0.05 debye for VQE without noise.

Conclusion: The study shows that QCM-based techniques can be adapted to reliably estimate non-energetic properties despite quantum device noise, supporting practical quantum chemistry applications.

Abstract: With rapid progress being made in the development of platforms for quantum
computation, there has been considerable interest in whether present-day and
near-term devices can be used to solve problems of relevance. A commonly cited
application area is the domain of quantum chemistry. While most experimental
demonstrations of quantum chemical calculations on quantum devices have focused
on the ground-state electronic energy of the system, other properties of the
ground-state, such as the electric dipole moment, are also of interest. Here we
employ the quantum computed moments (QCM) method, based on the Lanczos cluster
expansion, to estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on an IBM
Quantum superconducting quantum device. The noise-mitigated results agree with
full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations to within 0.03 $\pm$ 0.007
debye (2% $\pm$ 0.5%), compared to direct expectation value determination (i.e.
VQE) with errors on the order of 0.07 debye (5%), even when the VQE calculation
is performed without noise. This demonstrates that moments-based energy
estimation techniques can be adapted to noise-robust evaluation of
non-energetic ground-state properties of chemical systems.

TL;DR: QARAMultiLayered QAOA improvement for the exact cover problem


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity to enhance the performance of QAOA on noisy quantum devices

Method: Proposing a Quantum-AssistedRecursive Algorithm (QARA) that alternately employs classical and quantum pruning techniques

Result: Compared to QAOA and Recursive QAOA, QARAs success rate in finding exact solutions is 60% higher

Conclusion: QARA effectively mitigates the limitations of QAOA on noisy devices through layer-wise enhancements and classical-quantum hybridization

Abstract: The exact cover problem is an NP-complete problem with broad applications.
Studies show that although applying the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA) to this problem can yield improved solution quality with
deeper circuit depth, it can limit the algorithm's applicability on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices. To improve solution quality at shallow
depth, we propose a Quantum-Assisted Recursive Algorithm (QARA) for solving the
exact cover problem. QARA addresses the problem by alternately applying
classical and quantum pruning. Classical pruning is a repeatable pre-processing
step to simplify the problem. When the classical pruning cannot promote the
problem simplification, quantum pruning is invoked. During quantum pruning,
QARA extracts information from the QAOA's output state to identify the subset
with the strongest selection bias. This subset is then used to prune the
problem based on our problem-tailored reduction rules. Furthermore, QARA
incorporates a local verification and rollback mechanism to assistively judge
the effectiveness of the quantum simplification. After quantum pruning,
classical pruning is applied again to the reduced problem if the remaining
subsets and element set are not null. This alternating process repeats until
the original problem is fully resolved. In our numerical simulations, we
evaluate the performance of QARA at one-layer depth on 140 instances with
subset sizes ranging from 8 to 20. Numerical results show that the probability
of QARA in finding an exact solution is approximately 60\% higher than that of
both QAOA and Recursive QAOA, highlighting its efficiency.

Abstract: As quantum processors begin operating as tightly coupled accelerators inside

We present a hardware-maturity probe that quantifies a device's reliability by

low-overhead grid-sampling scheme with analytically verifiable outcomes. The
probe integrates reliability-engineering notions like run-to-failure

Abstract: We introduce a transparent, encoding-agnostic framework for determining when
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) can achieve early quantum
advantage. Our analysis shows this is unlikely on noisy intermediate scale
quantum (NISQ) hardware even in best case scenarios that use the most
qubit-efficient direct encodings. Closed-form resource counts, combined with
recent device benchmarks, yield three decisive go/no-go figures of merit: the
quantum feasibility point and the qubit- and gate-feasibility lines, which
place any CVRP instance on a single decision diagram. Contrasting a direct QUBO
mapping with a space-efficient higher-order (HOBO) encoding reveals a large
gap. Applied to early-advantage benchmarks such as Golden-5, our diagram shows
that HOBO circuits require only 7,685 qubits, whereas comparable QUBO encodings
still exceed 200,000 qubits. In addition to identifying candidate instances for
early quantum advantage in CVRP, the framework provides a unifying go/no-go
metric that ingests any CVRP encoding together with any hardware profile and
highlights when quantum devices could challenge classical heuristics. Quantum
advantage in CVRP would likely require innovative problem decomposition
techniques.

Abstract: We investigate the dephasing dynamics of a qubit as an effective mechanism
for estimating the temperature of its surrounding environment for different
symmetrizes. Our approach is fundamentally quantum, leveraging the qubit's
susceptibility to decoherence without necessitating thermal equilibrium with
the system under study. We also examine how symmetry properties affect the
accuracy of information retrieval and the robustness of quantum information
storage in such systems, highlighting their potential advantages in mitigating
decoherence effects. The optimization of quantum Fisher information is
performed with respect to both the interaction duration and the environmental
temperature, focusing on Ohmic-like spectral density environments. Furthermore,
we explicitly identify the optimal qubit measurement that attains the quantum
Cramer-Rao bound for precision. Our findings reveal that optimal estimation
arises from a complex interplay between the qubit's dephasing dynamics and the
Ohmic characteristics of the environment with a particular focus on
non-Hermitian systems that exhibit enhanced resilience to decoherence. Notably,
optimal estimation does not occur when the qubit reaches a stationary state nor
under conditions of complete dephasing.

Motivation: Improving the design of quantum networks to achieve high rates while reducing resource costs is crucial for the development of a future quantum internet.

Method: The authors use random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols to analyze quantum networks. They adapt multi-path routing algorithms to enhance performance.

Result: Single-path routing fails to achieve reliable rates over long distances, but the proposed multi-path algorithm successfully boosts performance while minimizing resource costs.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of multi-path routing in designing efficient quantum networks, offering a promising solution for scalable quantum communication systems.

Abstract: The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical
architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of
quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for
point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing
entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect
to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome
point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open
question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and
efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology
are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential
for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial
insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks.
Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and
practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated
with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying
single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability
to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for

Abstract: Quantum annealers can provide non-local optimization by tunneling between
states in a process that ideally eliminates memory of the initial
configuration. We study the crossover between memory loss and retention due to
quantum fluctuations, in a transverse Ising model on odd numbered
antiferromagnetic rings of thousands of spins with periodic boundary
conditions, by performing reverse quantum annealing experiments on three
programmable superconducting flux qubit quantum annealers. After initializing
the spins to contain a single domain wall, we then expose it to quantum
fluctuations by turning on the transverse Zeeman energy. We characterize the
crossover between memory retention at low transverse field, and memory loss at
high transverse field by extracting the Shannon information entropy of magnetic
domain wall distributions. We demonstrate a clear crossover in memory
retention, and its dependence on hardware platform and simulation time. Our
approach establishes a general probe of the interplay between quantum
fluctuations and memory.

Abstract: Quasiprobability representations are well-established tools in quantum
information science, with applications ranging from the classical simulability
of quantum computation to quantum process tomography, quantum error correction,
and quantum sensing. While traditional quasiprobability representations
typically employ real-valued distributions, recent developments highlight the
usefulness of complex-valued ones -- most notably, via the family of
Kirkwood--Dirac quasiprobability distributions. Building on the framework of
Schmid et al. [Quantum 8, 1283 (2024)], we extend the analysis to encompass
complex-valued quasiprobability representations that need not preserve the
identity channel. Additionally, we also extend previous results to consider
mappings towards infinite-dimensional spaces. We show that, for each system,
every such representation can be expressed as the composition of two maps that
are completely characterized by their action on states and on the identity
(equivalently, on effects) for that system. Our results apply to all
complex-valued quasiprobability representations of any finite-dimensional,
tomographically-local generalized probabilistic theory, with finite-dimensional
quantum theory serving as a paradigmatic example. In the quantum case, the
maps' action on states and effects corresponds to choices of frames and dual
frames for the representation. This work offers a unified mathematical
framework for analyzing complex-valued quasiprobability representations in
generalized probabilistic theories.

Abstract: The repeated interaction model provides a framework for emulating and
analyzing the dynamics of open quantum systems. We explore here the dynamics
generated by this protocol in a system that is simultaneously coupled to two
baths through noncommuting system operators. One bath is made to couple to
nondiagonal elements of the system, thus it induces dissipative dynamics, while
the other couples to diagonal elements, and by itself it generates pure
dephasing. By solving the problem analytically exactly, we show that when both
baths act concurrently, a strong system-bath coupling gives rise to nonadditive
effects in the dynamics. A prominent signature of this nonadditivity is the
characteristic {\it slowing down} of population relaxation, driven by the
influence of the dephasing bath. Beyond dynamics, we investigate the
thermodynamic behavior of the model. Previous studies, using quantum master
equations, showed that strong system-bath coupling created bath-cooperativity
in this model, allowing heat exchange to the dephasing (diagonally coupled)
bath. We find instead that, under the repeated interaction scheme, heat flows
exclusively to the dissipative bath (coupled through nondiagonal elements). Our
results highlight the need for a deeper understanding of the types of open
quantum system dynamics and steady-state phenomena that emerge within the
repeated interaction framework and the relation of this protocol to other
common open quantum system techniques.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges and oracle DAOs represent some of the most vulnerable
components of decentralized systems, with more than $2.8 billion lost due to
trust failures, opaque validation behavior, and weak incentives. Current oracle
designs are based on multisigs, optimistic assumptions, or centralized
aggregation, exposing them to attacks and delays. Moreover, predictable
committee selection enables manipulation, which threatens data integrity across
chains. We propose V-ZOR, a verifiable oracle relay that integrates
zero-knowledge proofs, quantum-grade randomness, and cross-chain restaking to
mitigate these risks. Each oracle packet includes a Halo 2 proof verifying that
the reported data was correctly aggregated using a deterministic median. To
prevent committee manipulation, VZOR reseeds its VRF using auditable quantum
entropy, ensuring unpredictable and secure selection of reporters. Reporters
stake once on a shared restaking hub; any connected chain can submit a fraud
proof to trigger slashing, removing the need for multisigs or optimistic
assumptions. A prototype in Sepolia and Scroll achieves sub-300k gas
verification, one-block latency, and a 10x increase in collusion cost. V-ZOR
demonstrates that combining ZK attestation with quantum-randomized restaking
enables a trust-minimized, high-performance oracle layer for cross-chain DeFi.

Abstract: We consider two two-level quantum emitters (QEs) with separations on the
order of the wavelength which are chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D)
waveguide, and the electromagnetic field of the 1D waveguide has a
direction-dependent velocity, which produces two field propagation phases on
the dynamics of QEs. Their spontaneous process is examined for QEs having
unequal emission rates to the waveguide. It is found that radiation could be
enhanced for both QEs, inhibited for both QEs, enhanced for one while inhibited
for the other, completely suppressed for both QEs. In particular, the mechanism
for radiation completely suppressed is the presence of a QE-photon bound state.

Abstract: This study proposes a new approach to quantum state recovery following
measurement. Specifically, we introduce a special operation that transfers the
probability amplitude of the quantum state into its orthogonal complement. This
operation is followed by a measurement performed on this orthogonal subspace,
enabling the undisturbed original quantum state to be regained. Remarkably,
this recovery is achieved without dependence of the post-measurement operation
on the measurement outcome, thus allowing the recovery without historical
dependence. This constitutes a highly nontrivial phenomenon. From the
operational perspective, as the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect and
probabilistic cloning of arbitrary quantum states, and traditional
post-measurement reversal methods typically rely on operations contingent on
the measurement outcomes, it questions fundamental assumptions regarding the
necessity of historic dependence. From an informational perspective, since this
recovery method erases the information about the measurement outcome, it's
intriguing that the information can be erased without accessing the measurement
outcome. These results imply the operational and informational non-triviality
formulated in a direct-sum Hilbert space framework.

first demonstrate that the natural representation of any quantum channel is a
pseudo-Hermitian matrix if it is diagonalizable with a discrete spectrum, due
to its eigenvalues being either real or in complex conjugate pairs. Then we
propose a general method to measure the channel spectrum by tracking the
measurement statistics of a specific outcome in sequential quantum channels. We
further construct and analyze a typical class of quantum channels, with each
channel being a unitary channel on a target system followed by a
weak-measurement channel induced by a Ramsey sequence of a probe qubit. We show
that the spectrum measurement of such channels can be utilized for learning the
free Hamiltonian generating the unitary channel of the target system. As
practical examples, we numerically demonstrate that a probe spin qubit can
accurately sense nuclear spin clusters for nanoscale nuclear magnetic
resonance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the efficacy of quantum computing in two distinct
machine learning tasks: feature selection for credit risk assessment and image
classification for handwritten digit recognition. For the first task, we
address the feature selection challenge of the German Credit Dataset by
formulating it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem,
which is solved using quantum annealing to identify the optimal feature subset.
Experimental results show that the resulting credit scoring model maintains
high classification precision despite using a minimal number of features. For
the second task, we focus on classifying handwritten digits 3 and 6 in the
MNIST dataset using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). Through meticulous data
preprocessing (downsampling, binarization), quantum encoding (FRQI and
compressed FRQI), and the design of QNN architectures (CRADL and CRAML), we
demonstrate that QNNs can effectively handle high-dimensional image data. Our
findings highlight the potential of quantum computing in solving practical
machine learning problems while emphasizing the need to balance resource
expenditure and model efficacy.

Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field in computer science that has seen
considerable progress in recent years, especially in machine learning. By
harnessing the principles of quantum physics, it can surpass the limitations of
classical algorithms. However, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), which rely
on adjustable parameters, often face the barren plateau phenomenon, hindering
optimization. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is a recent concept in
classical machine learning that has led to notable improvements in parameter
efficiency for neural networks. It states that within a large network, a
smaller, more efficient subnetwork, or ''winning ticket,'' can achieve
comparable performance, potentially circumventing plateau challenges. In this
work, we investigate whether this idea can apply to VQCs. We show that the weak
LTH holds for VQCs, revealing winning tickets that retain just 26.0\% of the
original parameters. For the strong LTH, where a pruning mask is learned
without any training, we discovered a winning ticket in a binary VQC, achieving
100\% accuracy with only 45\% of the weights. These findings indicate that LTH
may mitigate barren plateaus by reducing parameter counts while preserving
performance, thus enhancing the efficiency of VQCs in quantum machine learning
tasks.

Motivation: Automated quantum machine learning architecture search is becoming increasingly important as quantum computing advances, but manual methods are error-prone and time-consuming. This paper explores the use of reinforcement learning to address this challenge.

Method: The paper introduces RL-QAS, a framework that applies reinforcement learning to discover effective quantum circuit architectures for classification tasks. The method involves training an agent to autonomously design and optimize quantum circuits.

Conclusion: This paper shows that reinforcement learning is a viable approach for automated architecture search in quantum machine learning. However, further refinement is needed to apply RL-QAS to more complex tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to address computational
problems in ways that differ fundamentally from classical approaches. While
current quantum hardware remains error-prone and limited in scale, Variational
Quantum Circuits offer a noise-resilient framework suitable for today's
devices. The performance of these circuits strongly depends on the underlying
architecture of their parameterized quantum components. Identifying efficient,
hardware-compatible quantum circuit architectures -- known as Quantum
Architecture Search (QAS) -- is therefore essential. Manual QAS is complex and
error-prone, motivating efforts to automate it. Among various automated
strategies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains underexplored, particularly in
Quantum Machine Learning contexts. This work introduces RL-QAS, a framework
that applies RL to discover effective circuit architectures for classification
tasks. We evaluate RL-QAS using the Iris and binary MNIST datasets. The agent
autonomously discovers low-complexity circuit designs that achieve high test
accuracy. Our results show that RL is a viable approach for automated
architecture search in quantum machine learning. However, applying RL-QAS to
more complex tasks will require further refinement of the search strategy and
performance evaluation mechanisms.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational methods for enhanced gradient computation and observable estimation, which are essential for near-term quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Computation of observables and their gradients on near-term quantum hardware

Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU). Afterwards, we systematically analyze
the standard approaches to gradient computation with LCU circuits. Finally, we
develop a LCU gradient framework for the most general gradients based on
n-qubit gates and for time-dependent quantum control gradient, analyze the
convergence behaviour of the circuit estimators, and provide detailed circuit

Abstract: We revisit the monotonicity of relative entropy under the action of quantum
channels, a foundational result in quantum information theory. Among the
several available proofs, we focus on those by Petz and Uhlmann, which we
reformulate within a unified, finite-dimensional operator-theoretic framework.
In the first part, we examine Petz's strategy, identify a subtle flaw in his
original use of Jensen's contractive operator inequality, and point out how it
was corrected to restore the validity of his line of reasoning. In the second
part, we develop Uhlmann's approach, which is based on interpolations of
positive sesquilinear forms and applies automatically also to non-invertible
density operators. By comparing these two approaches, we highlight their
complementary strengths: Petz's method is more direct and clear, Uhlmann's is
more abstract and general. Our treatment aims to clarify the mathematical
structure underlying the monotonicity of relative entropy and to make these
proofs more accessible to a broader audience interested in both the foundations
and the applications of quantum information theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional subsystem under a time-dependent U(1)
gauge field coupled to rotationally invariant environments. To capture the
dynamic behavior of the subsystem under thermal excitations and dissipations,
it is imperative to treat the bath in a non-Markovian and nonperturbative
manner. This is because quantum noise is constrained by the uncertainty
principle, which dictates the relationship between the noise correlation time
and the amplitude of the energy fluctuation. To this end, we derive the
hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) incorporating the gauge field, enabling
a rigorous investigation of the dynamics of the reduced subsystem. Transforming
the HEOM into the Wigner representation yields quantum hierarchical
Fokker-Planck equations [U(1)-QHFPE] with U(1) gauge fields. These equations
incorporate vector fields into the damping operators while preserving both
gauge invariance and rotational symmetry. To demonstrate the practical use of
the formalism, the effects of a heat bath in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring. Our
investigation includes simulations of the equilibrium distribution, linear
absorption spectra, and AB currents under thermal conditions. Within a
rotationally invariant system-bath (RISB) model, we predict the emergence of a
persistent current even in dissipative environments, provided the bath is
non-Markovian and the temperature is sufficiently low. We also assessed the
validity of the Caldeira-Leggett model in this context.

Conclusion: 该理论为量子力学提供了新的解释框架。

Abstract: Quantum trajectory theories have not fully reconciled discrete quantum jumps
with continuous unitary evolution. We address this challenge by developing a
hidden variable formulation that reveals hidden correlations in individual
trials. We represent jump sequences as logical propositions on energy
eigenstate occupations, where logical variables describe their truth values and
chain operators describe their probabilities. To circumvent established no-go
theorems, we introduce a proposition selection rule that requires well-defined
joint probabilities for a given density operator. This rule unifies
compatibility criteria for quantum and hidden variable theories, eliminating
incompatible propositions that lead to value assignment paradoxes. Unlike
conventional criteria mandating operator commutativity, it permits propositions
that become deterministic for specific initial conditions. This framework
systematically captures deterministic relations in individual trials, including
the exclusivity of state occupation implied by the observed jumps. This
exclusivity, distinct from the Pauli exclusion principle, enables the
formalization of a quantum version of Boolean logic as laws for quantum
propositions. These assumptions circumvent Bell-type inequalities by
prohibiting arithmetic operations between incompatible logical variables, while
enabling classical descriptions within the complementarity. The resulting
theory reconciles discrete jumps with continuous evolution, providing a direct
description of individual trials while preserving standard probability
predictions.

 motivation: Developing efficient tools for quantum machine learning is crucial given the current state of quantum computing technology.
 method: A polynomial-time classical estimator is introduced to quantify noise resilience, trainability, and expressibility of quantum circuits.
 result: Moderate noise can reduce gradient vanishings but lower expressibility, with the estimator identifying noise-sensitive qubits and enabling targeted interventions reducing errors by 90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As quantum machine learning grows, efficient evaluation tools are needed, especially since quantum computing is still in its early stages.

Method: The authors introduce 2MC-OBPPP, a polynomial-time classical estimator that quantifies three key diagnostics for parameterized quantum circuits: noise resilience, trainability, and expressibility.

Result: The study demonstrates that moderate amplitude damping noise can reduce the severity of vanishing gradients but at the cost of lowered expressibility. Additionally, the approach identifies spatiotemporal noise-sensitive qubits and gates, and applying this map can mitigate up to 90% of errors with interventions on fewer than 2% of the qubits.

Conclusion: 2MC-OBPPP is a versatile, efficient, and hardware-independent tool that not only aids in the pre-execution evaluation of quantum circuits but also helps in designing targeted strategies to suppress noise effectively.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits are central to near-term quantum algorithms,
and serve as the foundation for many quantum machine learning frameworks, which
should be robust to noise, maintain trainability, and exhibit sufficient
expressibility. Here we introduce 2MC-OBPPP, a polynomial-time classical
estimator that quantifies the three aforementioned diagnostics for a given
parameterized quantum circuit. As a demonstration of the power of our approach,
we show that moderate amplitude damping noise can reduce the severity of
vanishing gradients, but at the cost of lowered expressibility. In particular,
our approach can yield a spatiotemporal "noise-hotspot" map that pinpoints the
most noise-sensitive qubits/gates in parameterized quantum circuits. Applying
this map to a specific circuit, we show that implementing interventions on
fewer than 2% of the qubits is sufficient to mitigate up to 90% of the errors.
Therefore, 2MC-OBPPP is not only an efficient, hardware-independent tool for
pre-execution circuit evaluation but also enables targeted strategies that
significantly reduce the cost of noise suppression.

Abstract: Spin ensembles are central to quantum science, from frequency standards and
fundamental physics searches to magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum
sensing. Their performance is ultimately constrained by spin projection noise,
yet solid-state implementations have so far been limited by much larger photon
shot noise. Here we demonstrate a direct, quantum non-demolition readout of a
mesoscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that surpasses
the photon shot-noise limit and approaches the intrinsic spin projection noise.
By stabilizing the $^{14}$N nuclear spin bath at high magnetic fields and
employing repetitive nuclear-assisted spin readout, we achieve a noise
reduction of 3.8 dB below the thermal projection noise level. This enables
direct access to the intrinsic fluctuations of the spin ensemble, allowing us
to directly observe the signatures of correlated spin states. Our results
establish projection noise-limited readout as a practical tool for solid-state
quantum sensors, opening pathways to quantum-enhanced metrology, direct
detection of many-body correlations, and the implementation of spin squeezing
in mesoscopic solid-state ensembles.

Abstract: Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump
terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We
analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In
particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs --
multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in
absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify
the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two
prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels
that serves as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate
through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We
analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the
order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric
tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds.

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent control of motional dynamics in trapped Rydberg ions
engineered to exhibit a conical intersection between adiabatic potential-energy
surfaces. Using quantum optimal control, an optimally shaped electric field
drives the motional wave packet between prescribed spatial configurations on
microsecond timescales. Localized nonadiabatic coupling breaks the symmetry of
the dynamics and produces a directed trajectory: after only a few early
passages through the conical intersection region, the packet proceeds toward
the target with high fidelity. In contrast, in the Born-Oppenheimer limit,
where such coupling is absent, the optimized control yields symmetric,
multi-cycle oscillations rather than a comparably directed displacement. While
both approaches reach the target at the chosen final time, the underlying
trajectories are qualitatively different. This work demonstrates that
engineered conical intersections can serve as a new control resource for
directional motional dynamics, complementing pulse-shaping methods in
trapped-ion systems. This directional motion of the ions, enabled by the
conical intersection, is expected to have important applications for quantum
information processing, where controlled motional states underpin high-fidelity
gate operations and scalable architectures.

symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy
bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy
formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing demands decoders that are fast, accurate,
and adaptable to circuit structure and realistic noise. While machine learning
(ML) decoders have demonstrated impressive performance for quantum memory,
their use in algorithmic decoding - where logical gates create complex error
correlations - remains limited. We introduce a modular attention-based neural
decoder that learns gate-induced correlations and generalizes from training on
random circuits to unseen multi-qubit algorithmic workloads. Our decoders
achieve fast inference and logical error rates comparable to most-likely-error
(MLE) decoders across varied circuit depths and qubit counts. Addressing
realistic noise, we incorporate loss-resolving readout, yielding substantial
gains when qubit loss is present. We further show that by tailoring the decoder
to the structure of the algorithm and decoding only the relevant observables,
we can simplify the decoder design without sacrificing accuracy. We validate
our framework on multiple error correction codes - including surface codes and
2D color codes - and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under
circuit-level noise. Finally, we show that the use of attention offers
interpretability by identifying the most relevant correlations being tracked by
the decoder. Enabling experimental validation of deep-circuit fault-tolerant
algorithms and architectures (Bluvstein et al., arXiv:2506.20661, 2025), these
results establish neural decoders as practical, versatile, and high-performance
tools for quantum computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to leverage quantum computing for improved graph-based learning, targeting applications in chemistry and materials science.

Method: The methodology involves extending the Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN) framework by integrating quantum attention mechanisms. This includes using parameterized quantum circuits to encode node features and employing dynamically learned unitaries for attention modulation.

Result: Experiments on the QM9 dataset demonstrate that QGATs, with or without attention layers, consistently outperform classical graph neural networks. Notably, quantum attention provides increasing benefits with larger molecular graphs.

Conclusion: The research establishes the viability of quantum attention mechanisms in enhancing the inductive capacity of quantum graph neural networks, suggesting promising applications in various science domains.

Abstract: We introduce Quantum Graph Attention Networks (QGATs) as trainable quantum
encoders for inductive learning on graphs, extending the Quantum Graph Neural
Networks (QGNN) framework. QGATs leverage parameterized quantum circuits to
encode node features and neighborhood structures, with quantum attention
mechanisms modulating the contribution of each neighbor via dynamically learned
unitaries. This allows for expressive, locality-aware quantum representations
that can generalize across unseen graph instances. We evaluate our approach on
the QM9 dataset, targeting the prediction of various chemical properties. Our
experiments compare classical and quantum graph neural networks-with and
without attention layers-demonstrating that attention consistently improves
performance in both paradigms. Notably, we observe that quantum attention
yields increasing benefits as graph size grows, with QGATs significantly
outperforming their non-attentive quantum counterparts on larger molecular
graphs. Furthermore, for smaller graphs, QGATs achieve predictive accuracy
comparable to classical GAT models, highlighting their viability as expressive
quantum encoders. These results show the potential of quantum attention
mechanisms to enhance the inductive capacity of QGNN in chemistry and beyond.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers
constitutes a significant security threat, enabling adversaries to inject
targeted errors across tenant boundaries. We present the first end-to-end
framework for mapping physical pulse-level attacks to interpretable logical
error channels, integrating density-matrix simulation, quantum process
tomography (QPT), and a novel isometry-based circuit extraction method. Our
pipeline reconstructs the complete induced error channel and fits an effective
logical circuit model, revealing a fundamentally asymmetric attack mechanism:
one adversarial qubit acts as a driver to set the induced logical rotation,
while a second, the catalyst, refines the attack's coherence. Demonstrated on a
linear three-qubit system, our approach shows that such attacks can
significantly disrupt diverse quantum protocols, sometimes reducing accuracy to
random guessing, while remaining effective and stealthy even under realistic
hardware parameter variations. We further propose a protocol-level detection
strategy based on observable attack signatures, showing that stealthy attacks
can be exposed through targeted monitoring and providing a foundation for
future defense-in-depth in quantum cloud platforms.

### [105] [Quantum Functional Information through the Evolution of Random Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11409)
*Rodrigo Pasti,Jonas Krause*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum Functional Information (QFI), a metric to gauge the rarity and utility of quantum states and circuits, distinguishing it from traditional measures like fidelity or entropy by focusing on the balance between functionality and scarcity in Hilbert space. QFI is validated through random circuit sampling and evolutionary algorithms. The former shows that states with near-perfect fidelity are less informative than slightly suboptimal but rarer states. The latter reveals that QFI optimization enhances circuit design by maintaining exploration, generating richer circuits, and fostering robustness compared to fidelity-only optimization. QFI presents a practical and interpretable tool for circuit benchmarking, variational quantum algorithms, and exploring quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper attempts to introduce a new metric for quantum states and circuits, but the explanation feels rushed and lacks depth. It does not clearly define how QFI quantifies rarity and functionality or provide concrete comparisons to existing metrics like fidelity or entropy. The motivation section is vague and does not fully justify the introduction of QFI compared to existing measures.

Method: The methodology is somewhat unclear. The paper mentions using random circuit sampling and evolutionary algorithms guided by fidelity or QFI objectives, but the details are too vague. The section on methodology lacks specific details about how the algorithms were implemented, how the results were validated, or how QFI was compared to other metrics. This makes it difficult to assess the rigor and reproducibility of the study.

Result: The paper's results hinge on the validation of QFI through two methods: random circuit sampling and evolutionary algorithms. However, the description of these results is not detailed enough. The abstract mentions that QFI optimization sustains exploration, generates richer circuits, and favors robust circuits with high fidelity, but these points are not elaborated upon. The evolutionary algorithm results indicate that QFI optimization diversifies the search space, but without specific metrics or comparisons, it's unclear what extent this occurs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that QFI is a practical and interpretable tool for circuit design, benchmarking, variational quantum algorithms, and exploring emergent patterns in quantum systems. However, the conclusion feels unsupported by the limited details in the abstract. The methodology and results are insufficient to conclusively establish QFI as a superior metric compared to existing ones. The conclusion is too presumptuous without substantial evidence.

Abstract: We introduce Quantum Functional Information (QFI), a new metric to quantify
the
  rarity and utility of quantum states and circuits. Unlike standard measures
such as fidelity
  or entropy, QFI captures the balance between functionality and rarity within
the Hilbert
  space. We validate QFI through two approaches: random circuit sampling and
evolutionary
  algorithms guided by fidelity or QFI objectives. Random sampling shows that
states with
  near-perfect fidelity are less informational than slightly suboptimal but
rarer states, while
  correlations reveal that high fidelity typically requires fewer gates and
shallower circuits.
  Evolutionary results demonstrate that fidelity-only optimization converges
quickly but reduces
  diversity and robustness, whereas QFI optimization sustains exploration,
generates richer
  structures, and favors robust circuits with high fidelity. These findings
position QFI as
  a practical and interpretable tool for circuit design, benchmarking,
variational quantum
  algorithms, and exploring emergent patterns in quantum systems.

Abstract: Estimation of an optical beam's transverse displacement is a canonical
imaging problem fundamental to numerous optical imaging and sensing tasks.
Quantum enhancements to the measurement precision in this problem have been
studied extensively. However, previous studies have neither accounted for
diffraction loss in full generality, nor have they addressed how to jointly
optimize the spatial mode and the balance between squeezing and coherent
amplitude. Here we show that, in the small-displacement limit, the seemingly
intractable infinite-spatial-mode problem can be reduced to a compact
three-mode interaction framework. We quantify the improvement afforded by an
optimized single-spatial-mode Gaussian-state probe over the optimal classical
laser probe, and show that a two-spatial-mode homodyne receiver is
asymptotically optimal for the former in the limit of high probe energy. Our
findings reveal a strategy for identifying quantum-optimal probes in the
presence of generic multimode linear probe-target interaction and photon loss.

Abstract: We present a model to detect a classical state mixed with an idler photon
from a polarization-entangled pair. A weak coherent light with a well-defined
polarization, matched in wavelength to the idler photon, is injected into the
idler channel. Quantum state tomography is then performed on both the
classically mixed idler photon and its entangled signal partner. The
reconstructed state is modeled as a combination of an $X-$quantum state and a
classical-quantum (CQ) state. In this framework, the weak coherent light acts
as a measurement apparatus performing a local polarization measurement on the
idler channel, thereby inducing a classical state. The density matrix of the
classical state is identified via algorithmic analysis of the diagonal and
off-diagonal elements of the reconstructed density matrix. This approach could
advance techniques for classical-quantum coexistence in networking
applications$\,-\,$such as quantum wrapping$\,-\,$as well as future quantum key
distribution protocols based on the coexistence of weak coherent states and
entangled photon states.

Abstract: A pivotal task for quantum computing is to speed up solving problems that are
both classically intractable and practically valuable. Among these,
combinatorial optimization problems have attracted tremendous attention due to
their broad applicability and natural fitness to Ising Hamiltonians. Here we
propose a quantum sampling strategy, based on which we design an algorithm for
accelerating solving the ground states of Ising model, a class of NP-hard
problems in combinatorial optimization. The algorithm employs a hybrid
quantum-classical workflow, with a shallow-circuit quantum sampling subroutine
dedicated to navigating the energy landscape. Using up to 104 superconducting
qubits, we demonstrate that this algorithm outputs favorable solutions against
even a highly-optimized classical simulated annealing (SA) algorithm.
Furthermore, we illustrate the path toward quantum speedup based on the
time-to-solution metric against SA running on a single-core CPU with just 100
qubits. Our results indicate a promising alternative to classical heuristics
for combinatorial optimization, a paradigm where quantum advantage might become
possible on near-term superconducting quantum processors with thousands of
qubits and without the assistance of error correction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Decoherence-free subspace (DFS) provides a crucial mechanism for passive
error mitigation in quantum computation by encoding information within
symmetry-protected subspaces of the Hilbert space, which are immune from
collective decoherence. Constructing a complete set of orthogonal basis states
for the DFS is essential to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation by using
the DFS codes. However, existing methods for preparing these basis states are
often non-scalable, platform-specific, or yield mixed states. Here, we propose
a deterministic approach to prepare pure, orthogonal and complete DFS basis
states for systems of arbitrary size composed of qubits. Our method employs
projective measurements and quantum circuits with single-qubit, two-qubit and
Toffoli gates. We provide a rigorous resource cost analysis both mathematically
and numerically. Meanwhile, we demonstrate the realizability of our method on
NISQ devices by discussing how to implement our method on a superconducting
chip. The proposed method offers a universal solution for preparing the DFS
basis states across diverse quantum computing platforms and system sizes, which
is realizable in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Weinvestigate the generation of antibunching photons and photon pairs in a

  system leveraging interatomic van der Waals (vdW) interaction. We show that
the vdW interaction
  shifts the two-atom excited state, enabling the suppression of two-photon
excitation via destructive
  interference in a diamond configuration. This leads to antibunching photon
emission with extremely
  high purity. Furthermore, by tuning the vdW interaction strength, the
conditions for conventional
  and unconventional photon blockades can overlap, significantly enhancing
single-photon emission.
  Conversely, at the antiblockade excitation frequency, quantum Monte Carlo
simulations demonstrate
  the feasibility of generating antibunching photon pairs with a high purity

Abstract: Scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electrometry has shown potential for
quantitative quantum imaging of electric fields at the nanoscale. However,
achieving nanoscale spatial resolution remains a challenge since employing
gradiometry to overcome electrostatic screening causes resolution-limiting
trade-offs including the averaging effect and the sensor-sample proximity.
Here, we demonstrate a scanning NV center protocol that achieves an enhanced
spatial resolution of approximately 10 nm. We develop an axially symmetric
probe with a sub-nanometer oscillating amplitude, which simultaneously provides
robust intermittent-contact mode feedback and ensures close engagement between
the diamond tip and the sample. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a
10 nm spatial resolution on ferroelectric lithium niobate. Scanning NV center
electrometry with this resolution can directly resolve the nanoscale polar
textures and dynamics of emerging ferroelectrics, which commonly arise on the
scale of tens of nanometers.

Abstract: Bohmian mechanics, also referred to as the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory,
represents a deterministic and nonlocal interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Since its origination in 1927, despite many attempts, reconciling it with
relativistic theory and verification of its relativistic effects have remained
elusive. Here, we report a direct observation of relativistic characteristics
of Bohmian mechanics. We reconstruct the relativistic Bohmian trajectories of
single photons utilizing weak measurement techniques in a double-slit
interferometer, unveiling a fundamental aspect of relativistic Bohmian
mechanics. We investigate the effective squared mass density of single photons,
revealing its negative values in the destructive regions -- a phenomenon
directly links to the tachyonic behavior in relativistic Bohmian mechanics. The
continuity equations given by both the Klein-Gordon equation and
Schr\"{o}dinger's equation are experimentally examined. Our result indicates
that within the framework of relativity, the conservation of energy holds true,
whereas the conservation of particle number for a free scalar field no longer
holds. The emergence of previously unobserved phenomena in the extensively
studied double-slit experiment are enabled by Bohmian mechanics, while
conversely, these experimental outcomes offer unambiguous evidence of the
long-sought-after relativistic features within Bohmian mechanics.

Motivation: The motivation behind the work is the difficulty in synthesizing photonic circuits for quantum computers, particularly in achieving a high success probability. Existing approaches are often not easily reusable.

Method: The method involves developing a tool that leverages dReal, a delta-weakened SMT solver, to find photonic circuits that emulate quantum computing gates while optimizing their success probability.

Result: The tool is demonstrated to be effective by recreating known results in the literature, extending upon them, and generating new results for Givens rotation gates.

Conclusion: This approach represents a novel and effective method for synthesizing photonic quantum circuits, highlighting the potential of using SMT solvers in quantum computing applications.

Abstract: For quantum computers based on photonics, one main problem is the synthesis
of a photonic circuit that emulates quantum computing gates. The problem
requires using photonic components to build a circuit that act like a quantum
computing gate with some probability of success. This involves not only finding
a circuit that can correctly act like a quantum gate, but also optimizing the
probability of success. Whilst many approaches have been given in the past and
applied to specific gates, they often lack ease of reusability. We present a
tool that uses dReal, a {\delta}-weakening SMT solver, to find such photonic
circuits, optimize the likelihood of occurring, and provide some guarantee that
the result is optimal. We demonstrate the usage of our tool by recreating known
results in the literature, extending upon them, and presenting new results for
Givens rotation gates.

Abstract: Camera-based wide-field quantum noise spectroscopy (QNS) with
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spins in diamond can be used to extract DC and AC
magnetic field noise with sub-micrometer spatial resolution, but its
realization is currently limited by the conflict between the optimal optical
spin readout time (normally below one microsecond) and the minimal camera
exposure time (normally tens of microsecond). In the present article, we
demonstrate fully coherent control of NV center spins via Rabi oscillation,
Ramsey, Hahn echo and relaxometry experiments, i.e. the core of QNS, with a
home-built camera-based setup, and achieve an unexpectedly high contrast of 12%
with an optical spin readout time of 500 microseconds. We explain the absence
of the above conflict in our system with the optical spin readout mechanism
under weak laser illumination, where spin-lattice relaxation and weak optical
pumping result in a rather slow reduction of contrast with increasing
integration time. The revealed mechanism is instructive for the construction of
the wide-field QNS with a sCMOS or EMCCD camera, and its application in the
studies of magnetic material or superconducting material.

Abstract: A significant performance inhibitor of free-space continuous variable quantum
key distribution (CVQKD) is turbulence, which gives rise to wavefront phase and
amplitude aberrations. We demonstrate that in a turbulent channel, during
coherent state transmissions from a continuous-wave laser, that the
interferometric visibility between the local oscillator (LO) and quantum signal
decreases. A solution to this is incorporating adaptive optics at the receiver
to correct phase and amplitude aberrations in the wavefronts of the received
quantum signal. We demonstrate the increased interferometric visibility and
decrease in its fluctuations in a 60 cm and 30 m turbulent channel when using
adaptive optics through channel characterisation. In an ideal CVQKD system, we
show that this leads to more precise and larger positive secret key rates,
improving the performance of free-space CVQKD in turbulent channels.

Abstract: Instead of the conventional construction of symmetric and antisymmetric

between two identical particles having arbitrary spin and negligible spin
interactions. We discuss extensions to larger domains via dynamical maps that

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tunable broadband Purcell filter for high-performance multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits, effectively addressing the trade-off between speed and photon-noise-induced dephasing. They achieve 99.6% single-shot readout fidelity with 100~ns pulses and 99.9% fidelity with 50~ns pulses using a multilevel protocol. The scheme supports simultaneous readout of three qubits with high fidelity and low crosstalk, coupled with strong QND performance. Expandable for scalable surface-code QEC, this presents a promising solution for fast and scalable quantum error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. High-fidelity, fast, and low-backaction readout schemes are crucial for practical implementations of QEC. This paper addresses the challenge of balancing these conflicting requirements in superconducting qubit readout systems.

Method: The authors implemented a tunable broadband Purcell filter-based readout system. They dynamically adjusted the filter parameters to suppress photon-noise-induced dephasing and enable rapid readout. Their method combines a multilevel readout protocol to enhance fidelity and scalability for multiplexed qubit readout.

Result: The tunable filter achieves an average single-shot readout fidelity of 99.6% with 100~ns pulses and 99.9% with 50~ns pulses. They also achieve excellent QND performance (99.4% fidelity over repeated measurements) and low leakage rates (<0.1%). The scalability of their method for surface-code QEC shows significant potential for practical quantum error correction applications.

Conclusion: This work presents a robust readout scheme for superconducting qubits that effectively resolves key limitations in QEC. The tunable filter-based approach combined with advanced readout protocols represents a significant step forward in enabling scalable and efficient quantum error correction.

Abstract: Fast, high-fidelity, and low back-action readout plays a crucial role in the
advancement of quantum error correction (QEC). Here, we demonstrate
high-performance multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits using a tunable
broadband Purcell filter, effectively resolving the fundamental trade-off
between measurement speed and photon-noise-induced dephasing. By dynamically
tuning the filter parameters, we suppress photon-noise-induced dephasing by a
factor of 7 in idle status, while enabling rapid, high-fidelity readout in
measurement status. We achieve 99.6\% single-shot readout fidelity with 100~ns
readout pulse, limited primarily by relaxation errors during readout. Using a
multilevel readout protocol, we further attain 99.9\% fidelity in 50~ns.
Simultaneous readout of three qubits using 100~ns pulses achieves an average
fidelity of 99.5\% with low crosstalk. Additionally, the readout exhibits high
quantum-nondemolition (QND) performance: 99.4\% fidelity over repeated
measurements and a low leakage rate below 0.1\%. Building on the tunable
broadband filter, we further propose a scalable readout scheme for surface code
QEC with enhanced multiplexing capability, offering a promising solution for
fast and scalable QEC.

Abstract: Recent reports of large photonic nonlinearities in integrated photonic
devices, using the strong excitonic light-matter coupling in semiconductors,
necessitate a tailored design framework for quantum processing in the limit of
low photon occupation. We present a gradient-based optimization method for
quantum photonic integrated circuits, which are composed of nonlinear unitary
coupling gates and stochastic, nonunitary components for sampling the photonic
losses. As core of our method, differentiable tensor-networks are leveraged,
which are accurate in the regime of low photonic occupation and modest
intermode entanglement. After characterizing the circuit gate architecture with
field simulations of GaAs-based samples, we demonstrate the applicability of
our method by optimizing quantum photonic circuits for two key use cases:
integrated designs for quantum optical state preparation and tailored optimal
readout for quantum phase sensing.

Abstract: Remote entanglement between independent and widely separated qubits is an
essential quantum phenomenon and a critical resource for quantum information
applications. Generating entanglement between qubits at arbitrary distances
requires the distribution of propagating quantum states. This necessity raises
the intriguing question whether the entanglement can be stabilized
indefinitely, instead of only periodically reestablished after decay. Here, we
report autonomous stabilization of entanglement between two separate
superconducting-qubit devices. Combining nonreciprocal waveguide coupling and
local driving, we experimentally realize distance-independent steady-state
remote entanglement in a coherent quantum-absorber scheme. Enhancing this
scheme with a new approach for overcoming inevitable disorder, we achieve a
concurrence approaching 0.5. Our results set the stage for on-demand
entanglement delivery in quantum processors and networks, and for protecting
multipartite entanglement in open systems.

Abstract: Quantum dot single-photon sources are promising for quantum communication.
Yet, the most advanced devices operate near 900 nm, where standard single-mode

dB/km near 934 nm. The fiber also supports strong classical signals at 1550 nm
without adding Raman noise. Using this platform, we transmit all four BB84
polarization states from an InAs quantum dot over 340 m with 0.1% QBER,
preserving single-photon purity and indistinguishability even in the presence

Conclusion: these experiments demonstrate promising progress toward scalable solid-state quantum memories. the high storage fidelity and sequential capabilities confirm the feasibility of integrating these technologies into future quantum networks and processors.

Abstract: Random-access quantum memories may offer computational advantages for quantum
computers and networks. In this paper, we advance arrays of solid-state quantum
memories towards their usage as random-access quantum memory. We perform
quantum storage of path and time-bin qubits implemented with weak coherent
states at the single-photon level, in an array of ten temporally-multiplexed
memory cells with controllable addressing. The qubits can be stored in
arbitrary combinations of memory cells, from which they are read-out on demand.
We find average fidelities of $95_{-2}^{+2}\;\%$ for path qubits and
$91^{+2}_{-2}\;\%$ for time-bin qubits. The measured fidelities violate the
classical bounds for both encodings and for all ten cells. We also sequentially
store a time-bin qubit in two different memory cells, maintain both qubits
simultaneously in the array, and perform a collective read-out. The individual

Abstract: We explore the possibility of forming a oriented polar molecule directly from
a pair of colliding atoms. The process comprises the photoassociation and
vibrational stabilization along with the molecular orientation. These processes
are driven by a single time-dependent, linearly polarized control field and
proceeds entirely within the electronic ground state, leveraging the presence
of a permanent dipole moment. The control field is found by means of an optimal
quantum control algorithm with a single target observable given by the
restriction of the orientation operator on a subset of bound levels. We
consider a rovibrational model system for the collision of O + H atoms and
solve directly the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We show that the
optimized field is capable of enhancing the molecular orientation already
induced by the photoassociation and vibrational stabilization thus yielding
oriented polar molecules that can be useful for many applications.

Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of
dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion,
or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can
be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$
over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in
(\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is
$d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following
discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of
$\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and
consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously,
norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$
\cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$
\cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all
levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to scale quantum computers to leverage quantum advantages, especially with large quantum circuits becoming more practical due to advances in quantum algorithms and hardware.

Method: The study uses Qiskit to simulate an eight-qubit circuit executed on four quantum processing units (QPUs), each with two computational and two communication qubits. Non-local CX gates are performed using the remote-CX protocol. The performance comparisons are made under binary classification tasks with both ideal and noisy conditions.

Result: The research indicates that alternative architectures, which sparingly use inter-QPU entanglement, yield better results under noisy conditions compared to a standard variational quantum classifier baseline.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that thoughtful architectural design is crucial for optimizing distributed quantum computing setups, and that the balance between entanglement usage and resilience to noise is key to achieving quantum advantage.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers, i.e., quantum processing units (QPUs) to enable
the execution of large quantum circuits is a major challenge, especially for
applications that should provide a quantum advantage over classical algorithms.
One approach to scale QPUs is to connect multiple machines through quantum and
classical channels to form clusters or even quantum networks. Using this
paradigm, several smaller QPUs can collectively execute circuits that each
would not be able on its own. However, communication between QPUs is costly as
it requires generating and maintaining entanglement, and hence it should be
used wisely. In this paper, we evaluate the architectures, and in particular
the entanglement patterns, of variational quantum circuits in a distributed
quantum computing (DQC) setting. That is, using Qiskit, we simulate the
execution of an eight qubit circuit using four QPUs each with two computational
and two communication qubits where non-local CX-gates are performed using the
remote-CX protocol. We compare the performance of various circuits on a binary
classification task where training is executed under ideal and testing under
noisy conditions. The study provides initial results on suitable VQC
architectures for the DQC paradigm, and indicates that a standard VQC baseline
is not always the best choice, and alternative architectures that use
entanglement between QPUs sparingly deliver better results under noise.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A key challenge in quantum complexity is how entanglement structure emerges
from dynamics, highlighted by advances in simulators and information
processing. The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on
information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem
gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total
entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we
introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling
power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for
R\'enyi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$
tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively
and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which
growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt
coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking
entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a
generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central
principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show
that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension
approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the
quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial
complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling R\'enyi
entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for
the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our
results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed
structure of quantum complexity.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for
harnessing quantum systems to process temporal data efficiently by bypassing
the costly training of gradient-based learning methods. Here, we demonstrate
the capability of this approach to predict and characterize chaotic dynamics in
discrete nonlinear maps, exemplified through the logistic and H\'enon maps.
While achieving excellent predictive accuracy, we also demonstrate the

quasi-conformal transformations -- and translate them into the framework of
quantum optical circuits. Conversely, using the example of the displaced
squeezed vacuum state, we demonstrate how established concepts from quantum
optics can inspire novel perspectives and enhancements in SVM methodology. This
cross-disciplinary approach highlights the potential of quantum optics to both
inform and benefit from advances in machine learning.

Abstract: We explore the evolution of a strongly interacting dissipative quantum Ising
spin chain that is driven by a slowly varying time-dependent transverse field.
This system possesses an extensive number of instantaneous (adiabatic)
stationary states which are coupled through non-adiabatic transitions. We
analytically calculate the generator of the ensuing slow dynamics and analyze
the creation of coherences through non-adiabatic processes. For a certain
choice of the transverse field shape, we show that the system solely undergoes
transitions among classical basis states after each pulse. The concatenation of
many of such pulses leads to an evolution of the spin chain under a many-body
dynamics that features kinetic constraints. Our setting not only allows for a
quantitative investigation of adiabatic theorems and non-adiabatic corrections
in a many-body scenario. It also directly connects to many-body systems in the
focus of current research, such as ensembles of interacting Rydberg atoms which
are resonantly excited by a slowly varying laser pulse and subject to dephasing
noise.

Abstract: We study multiparty entanglement near measurement induced phase transitions
(MIPTs), which arise in ensembles of local quantum circuits built with
unitaries and measurements. In contrast to equilibrium quantum critical
transitions, where entanglement is short-ranged, MIPTs possess long-range
k-party genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) characterized by an infinite
hierarchy of entanglement exponents for k >= 2. First, we represent the average
spread of entanglement with "entanglement clusters", and use them to conjecture
general exponent relations: 1) classical dominance, 2) monotonicity, 3)
subadditivity. We then introduce measure-weighted graphs to construct such
clusters in general circuits. Second, we obtain the exact entanglement
exponents for a 1d MIPT in a measurement-only circuit that maps to percolation
by exploiting non-unitary conformal field theory. The exponents, which we
numerically verify, obey the inequalities. We also extend the construction to a
2d MIPT that maps to classical 3d percolation, and numerically find the first
entanglement exponents. Our results provide a firm ground to understand the
multiparty entanglement of MIPTs, and more general ensembles of quantum
circuits.

Conclusion: 开发的IR-SRGAN方法对提高低温下单复合材料的损伤检测具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Evaluating impact-induced damage in composite materials under varying
temperature conditions is essential for ensuring structural integrity and
reliable performance in aerospace, polar, and other extreme-environment
applications. As matrix brittleness increases at low temperatures, damage
mechanisms shift: impact events that produce only minor delaminations at
ambient conditions can trigger extensive matrix cracking, fiber/matrix
debonding, or interfacial failure under severe cold loads, thereby degrading
residual strength and fatigue life. Precision detection and quantification of
subsurface damage features (e.g., delamination area, crack morphology,
interface separation) are critical for subsequent mechanical characterization
and life prediction. In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) coupled with a
newly developed frequency multiplexed photothermal correlation tomography
(FM-PCT) is employed to capture three-dimensional subsurface damage signatures
with depth resolution approaching that of X-ray micro-computed tomography.
However, the inherent limitations of IRT, including restricted frame rate and
lateral thermal diffusion, reduce spatial resolution and thus the accuracy of
damage size measurement. To address this, we develop a new transfer
learning-based infrared super-resolution generative adversarial network
(IR-SRGAN) that enhances both lateral and depth-resolved imaging fidelity based
on limited thermographic datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The thermal diffusivity measurement of impacted composites using pulsed
methods presents an ill-posed inverse problem influenced by multiple factors
such as sample thickness, cooling duration, and excitation energy. In this
study, a novel excitation method, evaporative cryocooling, was introduced for
measuring the thermal diffusivity of tested samples. Compared to conventional
excitation modalities, evaporative cryocooling excitation is compact, portable,
and low cost. However, evaporative cryocooling cannot be considered a pulsed
method due to its prolonged excitation duration. In general, it is difficult to
measure thermal diffusivity based on non-impulsive pulsed excitation at times
commensurate with the pulse duration, often due to ill-defined pulse shape and
width and the subsequent potentially complicated thermal response which may be
subject to diffusive broadening. To address this challenge, inverse
physics-informed neural networks (IPINNs) were introduced in this work and
integrated with an evaporative cryocooling method. The Parker method combined
with a photothermal method was employed as a reference. To improve the accuracy
of both IPINNs and Parker methods, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)
was employed for measuring the thickness of impacted composites. Simulations
and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the
IPINN-based approach.

Conclusion: The real-time super-resolution system shows promise for enhancing performance in IRT and PCT applications.

Abstract: Infrared thermography (IRT) and photothermal coherence tomography (PCT)
exhibit potential in non-destructive testing and biomedical fields. However,
the inevitable heat diffusion significantly affects the sensitivity and
resolution of IRT and PCT. Conventional image processing techniques rely on
capturing complete thermal sequences, which limits their ability to achieve
real-time processes. Here, we construct a real-time super-resolution imaging
system based on zero-shot learning strategy for the non-invasive infrared
thermography and photothermal coherence tomography techniques. To validate the
feasibility and accuracy of this super-resolution imaging system, IRT systems
were employed to test several industrial samples and one biomedical sample. The
results demonstrated high contrast in the region of interest (ROI) and
uncovered valuable information otherwise obscured by thermal diffusion.
Furthermore, three-dimensional photothermal coherence tomography was used to
validate the excellent denoising and deconvolution capabilities of the proposed
real-time super-resolution imaging system.

Abstract: We report the first successful production of a Cu-based Nb$_3$Sn sample
specifically designed for Quadrupole Resonator (QPR) testing, representing a
significant step toward scalable RF superconducting coatings of Nb$_3$Sn on
copper substrates. The sample was fabricated using an optimized electrochemical
thermal synthesis (ETS) via the bronze route, incorporating several key
advancements: electropolishing of the Cu substrate, electroplating of the
bronze precursor layer, a tailored heat treatment at approximately 700
$^\circ$C to promote grain growth and suppress tin-rich impurity phases, and a
newly developed chemical etching procedure for effective removal of surface
bronze residues and contaminants. These improvements address longstanding
challenges in the fabrication of high-quality Cu-based Nb$_3$Sn thin films.
Subsequent QPR measurements yielded the peak magnetic field and temperature
dependent surface resistance $R_s$, as well as the superconducting transition
temperature and quench field. Although the achieved RF performance --
characterized by a minimum $R_s$ of 43.4 n$\Omega$ at 4.5 K and 15 mT -- is not
yet optimal, the results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
and its potential for further enhancement through process refinement.

Abstract: Rydberg atoms, due to their large polarizabilities and strong transition
dipole moments, have been utilized as sensitive electric field sensors. While
their capability to detect modulated signals has been previously demonstrated,
these studies have largely been limited to laboratory-generated signals
tailored specifically for atomic detection. Here, we extend the practical
applicability of Rydberg sensors by demonstrating the reception of real-world
frequency-modulated (FM) audio transmissions using a consumer-grade handheld
two-way radio operating in the UHF band. Detection is based on the AC Stark
shift induced by the radio signal in a Rydberg atomic vapor, with demodulation
performed using an offset local oscillator and lock-in amplification. We
successfully demodulate speech signals and evaluate the audio spectral response
and reception range. We show that all consumer-accessible radio channels can be
simultaneously detected, and demonstrate simultaneous reception of two
neighboring channels with at least 53 dB of isolation. This work underscores
the potential of Rydberg atom-based receivers for practical, real-world FM
signal detection.

Abstract: We report the development of a chromatic and spherical aberration corrector
based on a combination of hexapole and quadrupole fields. Thick hexapole fields
are used to generate negative spherical and to correct residual axial and
off-axial aberrations. However, instead of using round transfer lenses placed
between the hexapoles, a quadrupole multiplet producing superimposed electric
and magnetic quadrupole fields is used to produce negative chromatic
aberration. The quadrupole multiplet also functions as a transfer doublet
within the corrector. In this paper, the simultaneous correction of chromatic
and spherical aberrations using this corrector design is described and we
demonstrate a resolution improvement in cases where the energy spread is
limiting.

Abstract: Error correction is essential for modern computing systems, enabling
information to be processed accurately even in the presence of noise. Here, we
demonstrate a new approach which exploits an error correcting phase that
emerges in a system of three coupled nonlinear resonators. Within this phase,
perturbed memory states are autonomously restored via the collective dynamics
of the nonlinear network. We implement our scheme using a network of
nanomechanical resonators. Nanomechanical systems are an attractive platform
for low energy computing, but purely mechanical error correction has not been
previously demonstrated. We experimentally show that the error correcting phase
provides a 35 times reduction in the rate of errors, and allows robust error
correction over a wide range of system parameters. These results highlight how
emergent nonlinear dynamics can be harnessed for practical applications, paving
the way towards error-resilient nanomechanical computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding root-soil interaction is crucial for agricultural and environmental research. However, traditional neutron imaging methods have limitations in capturing detailed root networks, especially in moist soil. This study aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The study employs a tilt-series neutron tomography technique, which involves rotating the sample 180 degrees while acquiring projections. This vertical acquisition axis avoids constraints typically encountered in laminography and allows for simultaneous radiographic and tomographic data collection.

Result: The tilt-series tomography successfully reconstructed root networks with reasonable accuracy despite some artifacts from the missing wedge. The method provides detailed insights into root architecture and soil water content changes but requires further optimization to reduce artifacts and improve quantitation accuracy.

Conclusion: This innovative approach offers a valuable tool for studying dynamic root-soil interactions, integrating structural and hydrological data. However, challenges such as artifact reduction and increased acquisition time remain to be addressed for broader applicability.

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of tilt-series neutron tomography for
analyzing rhizoboxes used in root-soil interaction studies. Traditional neutron

simultaneous radiographic and tomographic data acquisition, enhancing time
resolution and providing detailed insights into root networks and soil water
content. Experiments involved scanning six-week-old maize plants in rhizoboxes
filled with sand. Results show that tilt-series tomography can effectively
reconstruct root networks despite some artifacts from the missing wedge. While
the tilt-series tomographic data qualitatively reveal water distribution
changes, radiographic data remain essential for quantitative analysis. This
approach demonstrates the potential for dynamic root-soil interaction studies,
offering a valuable tool for agricultural and environmental research by
providing comprehensive insights into the rhizosphere.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel anisotropic quark star model in the backdrop of
mimetic gravitational theory. Our study focuses on the strange quark stars
using the MIT bag equation of state (EoS) admitting non-singular Buchdahl
metric function. The proposed model matches the interior spacetime of the
strange quark star with the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. Our analysis of
the energy conditions, radial and tangential EoSs along with the energy
momentum tensor gradients and TOV equilibrium condition analysis support the
model's physical validity. Further study of adiabatic index, surface redshift
function and speed of sound analysis have demonstrated the stability of the
strange quark star in mimetic gravity. Thus, we can say that the model
stability and consistency have been validated for various parameter values of
the Buchdahl function throughout our study in the context of mimetic gravity.

TL;DR: BBH precession detectable in GWs with certain parameter constraints, emissions peak at specific precession phases, and detectability is limited by spin and redshift factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding BBH dynamics and precession via GW signals enhances astrophysical models and tests general relativity.

Method: Theoretical modeling, parameter estimation using waveform models, and statistical analysis of GW events.

Result: Precessing BBHs exhibit distinguishable GW signals, with detectability peaking at certain precession phases; systematic effects limit detection at higher redshifts and spins.

Conclusion: Modeling precessing BBH waveforms aids in GW data analysis, offering new insights into black hole physics and cosmology.

Abstract: Nearly 210 binary black hole (BBH) mergers have been observed by the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network during its four observing runs. Generic BBHs are
spinning, and their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum
$\vec{L}$. These misaligned spins cause $\vec{L}$ to precess in a cone with
dimensionless precession amplitude $\tilde{\theta}$ and frequency
$\tilde{\Omega}$ about the nearly constant direction of the total angular
momentum. This precession modulates the observed GWs. We propose a model of
regularly precessing (RP) waveforms that incorporates $\tilde{\theta}$ and
$\tilde{\Omega}$ directly as parameters. We investigate how these waveforms
vary as functions of these precessional parameters, as well as binary
orientation and sky location. We use the Lindblom criterion to estimate that
precession can be detected in a RP source with signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$
when the mismatch $\epsilon$ with a non-precessing (NP) source with otherwise
identical parameters exceeds $1/2\rho^2$. Precession is most detectable when
$\vec{L}$ precesses through configurations we call +~nulls during the inspiral.
At +~nulls, a NP source only emits +-polarization to which the GW detector is
insensitive. The large mismatch between a RP source and this vanishing NP
signal enhances the detectability of precession. We also explore the
detectability of precession as a function of redshift $z$ for different BBH
populations. We find that for BBHs with isotropically oriented maximal spins,
precession is detectable in a majority of systems out to $z \approx 0.3$ for
chirp masses $10 \lesssim M_c/M_\odot \lesssim 40$ and mass ratios $q \gtrsim
0.5$. Reduced spin magnitudes or greater alignment between the spins and
$\vec{L}$ make it difficult to observe beyond $z \approx 0.1$. (abridged)

Abstract: The Schwarzschild geometry, describing the gravitational field of a spherical
mass in classical vacuum, is one of the most famous vacuum solutions of the
Einstein field equations. Classical vacuum is an idealization that does not
include quantum vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields, and determining the form
of the gravitational field of a spherical mass in quantum vacuum is an
important step towards understanding the interplay between gravity and quantum
field theory. We formulate and prove general results on the space of static,
spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes sourced by quantum
vacuum fluctuations, obtained under the broad assumptions that the quantum
vacuum energy density is negative and unbounded on Killing horizons. In
particular, we show the generic replacement of Killing horizons by wormhole
throats. We discuss how previous calculations in the literature that have used
different prescriptions for the regularized vacuum expectation value of the
quantum stress-energy tensor are particular cases of our general results.

Abstract: Spin-induced deformations of individual components of a binary can be
quantified using the gravitational wave signal the binary emits. Such
deformations are characterised by a parameter, $ \kappa $, which takes a value
of 1 for a black hole and thus its measurement can be used to test the no-hair
conjecture. However, in practice, only a symmetric combination of this
parameter for a binary ($ \kappa_s $) can be measured, thus instead enabling a
test for the no-hair conjecture in the context of a binary black hole system;
see for instance, Krishnendu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 091101 (2017),
arXiv:1701.06318. While previous studies have focused on circular binaries, we
extend this test to eccentric systems in a Fisher matrix based analysis. We
find that the error in the measurement of the parameter $ \kappa_s $ reduces
from a value of about 18% (for the circular case) to close to 8% (4%) for a $
10 M_{\odot} $ system with dimensionless component spins $ >0.8 $ and with a
reference initial eccentricity ($ e_0 $) of 0.2 (0.4) evaluated at 5 Hz for a
third generation detector, Cosmic Explorer (CE). Compared to the estimates
obtained by using Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, eccentricity and the
overall improved sensitivity of CE detectors together seem to improve these
estimates almost by an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for
dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a

Abstract: We derive and analyze a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole
(BH) obtained as a static, spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's
equations sourced by a cloud of strings (CoS) and a dark matter (DM) halo
modeled by a Dehnen-type density profile. We first study the geodesic motion of
massless and massive test particles, emphasizing how the CoS parameter $\alpha$

examine scalar perturbations via the effective potential and the associated
quasinormal-mode (QNM) spectra, showing how $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$ deform
oscillation frequencies and damping rates, thereby affecting stability
diagnostics. Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamics in the extended

energy, and specific heat capacity, and establishing a consistent first law and
Smarr relation with natural work terms for $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$. We
find that the interplay between the CoS and the DM halo produces quantitative
and sometimes qualitative changes in both dynamical and thermodynamical
properties, including shifts of the Hawking--Page transition and heat-capacity
divergences, thus reshaping the phase structure of Schwarzschild--AdS BHs.

Abstract: We investigate black hole superradiance evolution of the interacting multiple
fields. We consider a model of two scalar fields interacting with a cubic
coupling, and study the superradiant evolution of the cloud. We demonstrate
that superradiance is typically suppressed when the superradiant field couples
to another field, even with a very weak coupling strength. This implies that
the constraints on dark particles derived from single-field analyses can be
revised in the presence of interactions. Moreover, we find that the multi-field
superradiant evolution and its corresponding observational signatures can be
different across parameter spaces, which makes black hole superradiance an even
more powerful probe of the dark sector in particle physics.

Conclusion: ViT在连续引力波搜索中提供了一种高效且自动化的替代方法，减少了传统方法的计算和调整需求。

Abstract: Wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) using
semi-coherent matched-filter methods require enormous computing power, which
limits their achievable sensitivity. Here we explore an alternative search
method based on training neural networks as classifiers on detector strain data
with minimal pre-processing. Contrary to previous studies using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), we investigate the suitability of the transformer
architecture, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT). We establish
sensitivity benchmarks using the matched-filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for ten
targeted searches over a 10 day timespan, and ten directed and six all-sky
searches over a 1 day timespan. We train ViTs on each of these benchmark cases.
The trained ViTs achieve essentially matched-filter sensitivity on the targeted
benchmarks, and approach the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic detection probability of
$p_{\mathrm{det}}$ = 90% on the directed ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 85-89 %)
and all-sky benchmarks ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 78-88 %). Unlike the CNNs
in our previous studies, which required extensive manual design and
hyperparameter tuning, the ViT achieves better performance with a standard
architecture and minimal tuning.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a self-dual black hole (BH) in Loop Quantum Gravity

from Mercury's perihelion shift and the orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius
A$^{\star}$ (Sgr A$^{\star}$), we derive constraints on the polymeric function

various scenarios to explore their observational relevance. Finally, we examine
the properties of accretion disks around the self-dual BH in LQG, including
their direct and secondary images, and study the redshift and the observed
energy flux distribution across the accretion disk as measured by distant
observers for different inclination angles. Our findings provide new insights
into the physical nature and accretion properties of self-dual BHs in LQG and
their possible observational consequences.

### [153] [Gravitational perturbations of Dymnikova black holes: grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11017)
*Alexey Dubinsky*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of the Dymnikova regular black hole and finds that the Hawking radiation spectrum is mainly governed by the modified Hawking temperature. The grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections deviate only slightly from the Schwarzschild case when the quantum parameter l_{cr} varies. The correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors holds with high accuracy for multipoles \(\ell \geq 2\).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the properties of black hole Hawking radiation and its spectrum is fundamental in theoretical physics. This paper contributes to that understanding by examining the Dymnikova regular black hole, a type of asymptotically flat spacetime.

Method: The authors use the WKB method with Padé approximants to compute grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections. They also test the correspondence between quasinormal frequencies and transmission coefficients.

Result: The analysis shows that while the quantum parameter l_{cr} affects the effective potential near the horizon, its impact on grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections is minimal compared to the Schwarzschild case. The correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors remains robust for multipoles \(\ell \geq 2\).

Conclusion: This study deepens our knowledge of black hole perturbations and supports the validity of the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body absorption in the Dymnikova geometry for higher multipoles. The results are consistent with expectations from Schwarzschild black hole physics despite modifications introduced by the Dymnikova regular black hole structure.

Abstract: We study axial gravitational perturbations of the Dymnikova regular black
hole, an asymptotically flat spacetime in which the Schwarzschild singularity
is replaced by a de Sitter core. Using the WKB method with Pad\'e approximants,
we compute grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections, and test the
recently proposed correspondence between quasinormal frequencies and
transmission coefficients. We find that variations of the quantum parameter
\(l_{\rm cr}\) affect the effective potential only near the horizon, leading to
minor deviations of grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections from the
Schwarzschild case. As a result, the Hawking radiation spectrum is governed
mainly by the modified Hawking temperature, with grey-body factors providing
only subleading corrections. Unlike higher quasinormal overtones, which are
highly sensitive to near-horizon deformations, the grey-body factors remain
robust, a feature explicitly confirmed for the Dymnikova geometry. The
correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors holds in our
case with high accuracy for multipoles $\ell \geq 2$.

Abstract: We extend the study of gravitational lensing to photons traversing the lens
mass, modeled as a uniform-density fluid described by the interior Kottler
(Schwarzschild--de Sitter) solution smoothly matched to the exterior Kottler
region. An analytic expression for the time delay is derived, allowing the
interior contribution to be explicitly isolated relative to the vacuum Kottler
case. This correction is found to systematically enhance the total time delay,
an effect corroborated by numerical evaluations for astrophysically relevant
lenses at both galaxy and cluster scales. These results underscore the
importance of accounting for the interior lens structure in accurate modeling
of strong lensing time delays.

While we do not have the technology for a similar mission today, it may be
available in the next 20-30 years. The whole mission may last up to a century
(depending on the actual distance of the black hole and the speed of the
probe), but it may represent a unique opportunity to perform precise and
accurate tests of General Relativity in the strong field regime.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve the accuracy of Shapiro time delay measurements, which are crucial for testing general relativity and studying phenomena in the solar system and extragalactic binary pulsar systems.

Method: The authors developed an exact analytical equation for the Shapiro time delay and compared it with first and second-order expressions for Schwarzschild spacetime and first-order post-Newtonian formalism.

Result: The exact equation provides accurate results for the Shapiro time delay, with discrepancies at the picosecond and sub-picosecond level when compared to Schwarzschild, 1PN, and 2Sch approximations in the solar system and extragalactic binary pulsar systems.

Conclusion: This work offers a significant advancement in the precision of Shapiro time delay measurements, particularly valuable for scenarios requiring ultra-high accuracy.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical equation for the Shapiro time delay (STD) due
to a spherical non-rotating body. As a result, accurate values of the STD in
comparison with first and second-order expressions for Schwarzschild spacetime
(1Sch and 2Sch) and first-order post-Newtonian formalism (1PN) are achieved.
Accordingly, the lowest STD discrepancies between our exact equation and these
approximations lie within the picosecond and sub-picosecond level for light
beams affected by the Sun's gravity. Our results might be useful for time delay
measurements in the solar system or extragalactic binary pulsar systems, where
a high accuracy level is required.

Abstract: In this work we elaborate on solving the trans-Planckian censorship problem
of standard slow-roll inflation by using a power-law inflationary tail
generated by a scalar field with an exponential potential. We use a
quantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined
$F(R,\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law
subspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the
$F(R,\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity
system and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points.
However, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the
combined $F(R,\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated
phenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off
below a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary
era, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term
and the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian. The
remaining system can successfully realize a power-law tail of the $R^2$
slow-roll era.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider gravitational collapse of a fluid sphere with torsion generated
by spin, which forms a black hole. We use the Tolman metric and the
Einstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source.
We show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity,
replacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during
contraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during
expansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts
of matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon
may have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle
larger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy
dominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore
originated from a black hole existing in another universe.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the magnetic field generated by a toroidal
current loop situated in the equatorial plane of a non-rotating Schwarzschild
black hole, based on the dynamics of charged particles. Using the exact general
relativistic solution for the magnetic field, we analyze particle motion both
analytically and numerically, identifying regions of stable and unstable
orbits. In particular, we classify charged particle dynamics into attractive
and repulsive Lorentz force configurations and show that in the attractive
case, charged particles can accumulate near the current loop, forming
collective currents that oppose the original current loop magnetic field. We
demonstrate that charged particle accumulation can lead to the formation of
toroidal structures analogous to radiation belts in the BH magnetosphere. We
compare the curved spacetime solution to flat spacetime analogs and highlight
general relativistic effects such as the existence of the innermost stable
circular orbit for charged particles, which sets a lower bound for radiation
belt formation. The divergence of the vector potential at the loop location in
the idealized infinitesimal loop model is addressed, and we argue that a
physically realistic model must consider a finite-width current distribution to
avoid unphysical divergences in the effective potential.

Abstract: We discuss and formalize a topological means by which the initial singularity
might be mollified, at the level of the spacetime manifold's structure, in
classical cosmological models of a homogeneous expanding universe. The
construction, dubbed a "reflective" topological big bang, generalizes
Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the
standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale
universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an
earliest "moment" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical
characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective
topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in
cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've
christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal
cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures
of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper shows that solutions of Einstein's equations with trapped regions developable within a finite time to distant observers impose restrictive conditions on the energy-momentum tensor and continue to be viable. Additionally, it introduces new static solutions with regular horizons favoring finite-time horizon crossing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of black holes and the dynamics of spacetime under extreme conditions is a fundamental aspect of theoretical physics, particularly in the realm of general relativity.

Method: The analysis is carried out within a semiclassical framework, focusing on the structure of the Einstein equations and the properties of the energy-momentum tensor. Example calculations with differential equations related to spacetime curvature and energy distribution are employed.

Result: The paper presents evidence that previously discarded classes of energy-momentum tensors are actually unphysical (likely a misphrase, should read that classes previously thought impossible are actually possible). Additionally, it discovers new static solutions that are consistent with horizon crossing by distant observers in finite time.

Conclusion: This work clarifies the constraints on the energy-momentum tensor in black hole physics and expands the known solution classes within general relativity. The findings enhance the theoretical framework for descendant studies concerning these spacetime configurations.

Abstract: Within a semiclassical framework, we investigate spherically symmetric
solutions of the Einstein equations that (i) develop a trapped region within a
finite time as measured by distant observers, and (ii) remain sufficiently
regular at the apparent horizon. These requirements characterize the
self-consistent approach, and it imposes specific constraints on the limiting
form of the energy momentum tensor (EMT). Previous works argued that only
certain EMT classes admit viable dynamical solutions, while discarding others
(see, e.g., Terno 2020) based on reasoning that is not entirely robust. Here,
we explicitly demonstrate that the discarded classes are indeed unphysical. In
addition, we also introduce a new class of static solutions that are regular at
the horizon and allow finite-time horizon crossing according to a distant
observer.

Abstract: We present a singularity-free relativistic interior solution for constructing
stable quark stellar models in the framework of a linear $f(Q)$ gravity ($f(Q)
= \alpha Q + \phi$) satisfying the pseudo-spheroidal geometry. The physical
features and the stability of the stellar model is explored with strange star
(SS) candidate EXO 1745-248 ($M = 1.7\, M_{\odot}$ and $R = 9\, km$). The
Durgapal-Banerjee transformation is employed to obtain the relativistic
interior solution using the MIT Bag model equation of state (EoS): $P =
\frac{1}{3}(\rho - 4 B_{g})$. For a linear form of $f(Q)$ gravity, we obtain
the exterior vacuum solution, which reduces to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter
(SdS) solution with the cosmological constant term, $\Lambda =
\frac{\phi}{2\alpha}$. The stellar model is analyzed for the different values
of the spheroidicity parameter ($\mu$). The value of $\alpha$ is constrained
using a viable physical limit on the Bag parameter ($B_{g} \in
[57.55,95.11]\,MeV\,fm^{-3}$). The constraints on Mass-Radius relation
indicates that physically acceptable SS models are permitted for $\mu \geq 7$.
The contribution of $\mu$ to the energy density, pressure profiles, and other
physical features is studied for the SS candidate EXO 1745-248. The stability
of the stellar model obtained here is also analyzed through causality
condition, adiabatic index and other stability criteria. We also investigate
the stellar model for other SS candidates to test its viability. The
relativistic interior solution obtained here can be used to construct viable
and physically acceptable strange star models with very high compactness ratio
in the framework of linear $f(Q)$ gravity.

Abstract: We study inflationary characterictics of the universe in $n$-DBI gravity,
driven by DBI-deformed scalar fields. In this paper, we consider the evolution
of the classical universe for a scalar potential whose equations of motion are
expressed by a BPS-like system of first-order differential equations.The
advantage of a BPS-like system is that it allows the initial condition for the
wave function of the Universe in minisuperspace quantum cosmology to be
automatically determined by the Hamiltonian constraint. By appropriately
choosing the prepotential underlying the potential, we can construct
single-scalar-field models that have the phases of exponential and power-law
expansions. We show that the slow-roll parameters for our models can be
expressed in terms of the prepotential with simple settings.

Motivation: The study aims to understand how the timing of gravitational wave detections might affect their detectability by observing real-world variations.

Method: The research analyzes data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs using public data to detect patterns in detection probabilities over time.

Result: There are consistent weekly variations in detection probability, including differences between weekends and weekdays, day and night, and time zones.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that time-dependent factors should be considered when interpreting gravitational wave detection data.

Abstract: Yes, it can.
  Catalogs produced by networks of Gravitational-wave interferometers are
subject to complicated selection effects, and the gold-standard remains direct
measurements of the detection probability through large injection campaigns. I
leverage public data products from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' 3rd and
4th observing runs to show that there are non-trivial temporal variations
within the detection probability that are well-described by a weekly cycle.
There are clear differences between weekends and weekdays, between day and

Abstract: We provide a summary of several parametrisations for the nuclear equation of
state that have been proposed over the past decades and list viable ranges for
their parameters. Based on these parametrisations, we construct a large
database of rotating neutron star models, which are arranged in sequences of
constant central energy density. After filtering these sequences with respect
to generous astrophysical constraints, we discover tight universal relations
for various bulk quantities of uniformly rotating neutron stars of arbitrary
rotation rates. These universal relations allow to estimate, at very low
computational cost, bulk quantities of rotating neutron stars employing mass,
radius, and moment of inertia of associated non-rotating neutron stars. The
relations are calibrated to a large, model-agnostic dataset, thereby
eliminating a potential bias, and prove to be robust. Such relations are
important for future, high-precision measurements coming from electromagnetic
and gravitational wave observations and may be used in equation of state
inference codes or gravitational wave modeling among others.

Abstract: This work aims to explore the gravitational consequences of a recently
proposed black hole solution presented in the literature [Phys. Dark Univ. 50
(2025) 102061]. We initiate our analyzes by taking into account the horizon
structure, focusing on both the event and Cauchy horizons. Subsequently, we
examine the quasinormal modes by considering all types of perturbations --
scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial. To strengthen these results, we also
compute the time-domain for each perturbation. Next, we turn to the study of
optical properties of the black hole. In particular, we investigate null
geodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding
black hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena
in two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and
the strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto's approach. In addition, we
confront the lensing observables with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for
$Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, constraints on the parameter $\xi$ -- which
is introduced by higher-order curvature-scalar gravity, thereby differing from
the Schwarzschild solution -- are estimated using Solar System measurements
such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, gravitational light bending, and
time delay (or Shapiro effect).

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates quasinormal modes and tidal Love numbers of quantum-modified black holes in specific frameworks, finding that the quantum parameter affects QNMs and Love numbers in distinct ways depending on the perturbation type and metric solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of quantum gravity on black hole perturbation dynamics and cosmological observations.

Method: Derived perturbation equations, used pseudospectral methods for QNMs, and numerical integration for Love numbers.

Result: Higher overtones show enhanced $	ext{ζ}$ sensitivity. Solution 1 has purely imaginary QNMs under $	ext{ζ}$ variation, while Solution 2 shows mode transitions. Love numbers depend non-monotonically on $	ext{ζ}$ for axial perturbations, but show strictly monotonic effects for polar perturbations.

Conclusion: Quantum gravity significantly impacts BH dynamics and phenomeneology, with quantum effects becoming more prominent at higher spherical harmonic modes $	ext{ℓ}$. These findings advance our understanding of black hole behavior near quantum gravity scales and improve future cosmological modeling efforts.

Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and tidal
Love numbers of covariant quantum-modified black holes (BHs) within two
cosmological constant-dependent metric frameworks. By deriving axial/polar
perturbation equations and employing pseudospectral methods (for QNMs) and
numerical integration (for Love numbers), we quantify the quantum parameter
$\zeta$'s influence. We find that, higher overtones exhibit enhanced $\zeta$
sensitivity. Solution 1 maintains purely imaginary QNMs under $\zeta$
variation, whereas Solution 2 demonstrates mode transitions from real to
complex for polar/axial perturbations. Furthermore, for Love number, axial
perturbations show non-monotonic $\zeta$ dependence, with
$\Delta\mathcal{T}^a_l$ peaking at specific $\ell$ values before decay. While
for polar perturbation of the same metric displays strictly monotonic $\zeta$
effects on $\Delta\mathcal{T}^p_l$. These results highlight quantum gravity's
role in BH perturbation dynamics and cosmological BH phenomenology.

Motivation: The authors aim to develop a more sensitive gravitational wave detector by addressing common noise sources.

Method: They build upon the Juggled Interferometer using free-fall test masses that operate without external influences like seismic or thermal noise during free-fall. They employ detrending to remove actuation noise.

Result: The implementation of JIGI achieves sensitivity gains of about four orders of magnitude in the 0.1-0.3 Hz range compared to previous estimations.

Conclusion: JIGI represents a significant advancement in gravitational wave detection technology due to its enhanced sensitivity and noise reduction capabilities.

Abstract: We propose the Jiggled Interferometer (JIGI), a novel ground-based
gravitational wave detector with space-like sensitivity. Using rapidly-repeated
free-fall test masses, JIGI eliminates seismic and suspension thermal noise
during free fall. Compared to the Juggled Interferometer, it offers improved
angular stability and avoids tracking lasers. We analyze detrending--a required
step to remove actuation-induced noise--and show sensitivity gains of about
four orders of magnitude in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band, relative to seismic and
suspension noise extrapolated from the Cosmic Explorer.

Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of the RIT-2.5 radiofrequency
ion thruster, complemented by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to establish
correlations between plasma parameters and extracted beam properties. The
thruster was operated in a dedicated vacuum facility and equipped with optical
spectroscopy, Faraday cup, and retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA)
diagnostics. Electron temperature was determined from optical emission line
ratios (Te about 3-7 eV), while the energy distribution of extracted ions was
measured using the RFEA. A comparative simulation campaign was performed to
reproduce the experimentally observed energy spectra and to extract plasma
density values otherwise inaccessible due to the lack of intrusive diagnostics,
yielding best-fit estimates of ne about 1.2x10E16 m-3. The results demonstrate
that the energy spread of the extracted beam is strongly dependent on plasma
density and electron temperature. The combined experimental-numerical approach
provides a non-intrusive yet robust pathway for performance optimization of RF
ion thrusters, offers validation benchmarks for advanced plasma simulation
codes, and is particularly well-suited to compact micro-N-class thrusters for
nanosatellite attitude and orbit control.

Abstract: The high gradients potentially achievable in distributed-coupling C-band
photoinjectors make them attractive for many high brightness applications. Here
we discuss optimization results for a 1.6 cell C-band photoinjector with a 240
MV/m peak field at the cathode that delivers a 250 pC electron bunch charge. We
use a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), obtaining a Pareto front of
emittance vs. bunch length. We also perform MOGA optimizations including an
aperture to retain only a bright beam core. We find this reduces the emittance
of the final beam by more than factor of 2 in some cases. For example, we find
that at a root mean square bunch length of 1.6 ps, the use of an aperture
improves the transverse emittance from 120 nm to 58 nm assuming negligible
photocathode intrinsic emittance. The sacrificial charge at the periphery of
the electron beam removed by the aperture linearizes the final slice phase
space inside of the remaining beam core. The results obtained surpass the
experimental state-of-the-art for beamlines with similar bunch charge.

Abstract: Electron-positron colliders operating in the GeV region of center-of-mass
energies or the Tau-Charm energy region, have been proven to enable competitive
frontier research, due to its several unique features. With the progress of
high energy physics in the last two decades, a new-generation Tau-Charm
factory, Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) has been actively promoting by the
particle physics community in China. STCF holds great potential to address
fundamental questions such as the essence of color confinement and the
matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the next decades. The main
design goals of STCF are with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 2 to 7 GeV
and a peak luminosity surpassing 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 that is optimized at a
center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV, which is about 50 times that of the currently
operating Tau-Charm factory - BEPCII. The STCF accelerator is composed of two
main parts: a double-ring collider with the crab-waist collision scheme and an
injector that provides top-up injections for both electron and positron beams.
As a typical third-generation electron-positron circular collider, the STCF
accelerator faces many challenges in both accelerator physics and technology.
In this paper, the conceptual design of the STCF accelerator complex is
presented, including the ongoing efforts and plans for technological R&D, as
well as the required infrastructure. The STCF project aims to secure support
from the Chinese central government for its construction during the 15th
Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) in China.

Abstract: The Large Particle Physics Laboratory Directors Group (LDG) established the
Working Group (WG) on the Sustainability Assessment of Future Accelerators in
2024 with the mandate to develop guidelines and a list of key parameters for
the assessment of the sustainability of future accelerators in particle
physics. While focused on accelerator projects, much of the work will also be
relevant to other present and upcoming research infrastructures. The
development and continuous update of such a framework aim to enable a coherent
communication amongst scientists and adequately convey the information to a
broader set of stakeholders. This document outlines the key findings and
recommendations of the LDG Sustainability WG and provides a summary of current
best practices aimed at enabling sustainable accelerator-based research
infrastructures. Not all sustainability topics are addressed at the same level.
The assessment process is complex, largely under development and a homogeneous

Abstract: While the prediction of AC losses during transients is critical for designing
large-scale low-temperature superconducting (LTS) magnets, brute-force
finite-element (FE) simulation of their detailed geometry down to the length
scale of the conductors is a computational challenge. Multi-scale methods,
balancing between a coarse approximation of the fields at the scale of the
magnet and a detailed description at the scale of the conductors, are promising
approaches to reduce the computational load while keeping a sufficient
accuracy. In this work, we introduce a neural network approach to accelerate
multi-scale magneto-thermal simulations of LTS magnets by replacing costly
single-turn FE models with neural network surrogates. The neural network
architecture is presented and discussed, together with an automated procedure
for generating simulation data for its training. The resulting accelerated
multi-scale model is used to simulate current ramp-up procedures for the IBA
S2C2 magnet. The surrogate-based multi-scale model is compared with a
conventional multi-scale model based on a composite wire-in-channel FE model.
The surrogate model is shown to reproduce single-turn filament hysteresis,
inter-filament coupling, and eddy losses, while the computational time of the
multi-scale method is reduced by a factor of 800.

TL;DR: This study investigates the relationship between bird song production and respiratory biomechanics, revealing that song production drives a nonlinear resonance regime that broadens the frequency range of amplified responses. By combining physiological recordings with a nonlinear biomechanical model, the researchers demonstrate that canaries (Serinus canaria) achieve an average amplification of 94% of the theoretical maximum, suggesting shared optimization strategies across behavioral states, including sexually selected displays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to understand how different behaviors in birds, such as song production, are shaped by biomechanical constraints and how these constraints may overlap with other behaviors, like quiet breathing.

Method: The study combines physiological recordings with a nonlinear biomechanical model to analyze the relationship between bird song production and respiratory biomechanics.

Result: The results show that song production in canaries drives a nonlinear resonance regime, broadening the frequency range of amplified responses and achieving 94% of the theoretical maximum amplification.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that birds optimize their respiratory and song production systems in a shared manner across different behavioral states, even those shaped by strong sexual selection.

Abstract: Evolution has shaped animal bodies, yet to what extent biomechanical devices
provide constraints and opportunities across different behaviors remains
unclear. In birds, quiet breathing operates at a resonance of the respiratory
biomechanics, but song, a behavior thought to be shaped by strong sexual
selection, requires much higher breathing rates. Combining physiological
recordings with a nonlinear biomechanical model, we show in canaries (Serinus
canaria) that song production drives the system into a nonlinear regime that
broadens the frequency range of amplified responses. This enhancement
encompasses all syllabic rates, with an average magnification of ~94% of the
theoretical maximum. Our results show that birds breathe and sing at a
resonance, revealing that optimization strategies can be shared across
behavioral states and extend to sexually selected displays.

Abstract: Adhesion-independent migration is a prominent mode of cell motility in
confined environments, yet the physical principles that guide such movement
remain incompletely understood. We present a phase-field model for simulating
the motility of deformable, non-adherent cells driven by contractile surface
instabilities of the cell cortex. This model couples surface and bulk
hydrodynamics, accommodates large shape deformations and incorporates a
diffusible contraction-generating molecule (myosin) that drives cortical flows.
These capabilities enable a systematic exploration of how mechanical cues
direct cell polarization and migration. We first demonstrate that spontaneous
symmetry breaking of cortical activity can lead to persistent and directed
movement in channels. We then investigate how various physical cues - including
gradients in friction, viscosity, and channel width as well as external flows
and hydrodynamic interactions between cells - steer migration. Our results show
that active surface dynamics can generate stimulus-specific cell behaviors,
such as migration up friction gradients or escape from narrow regions. Beyond
cell migration, the model offers a versatile platform for exploring the
mechanics of active surfaces in biological systems.

Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry allows waves to retrace their paths through complex
media and refocus at their origin. However, incomplete capture and reversal of
scattered waves often limits pulse recompression. We address this challenge for
spatially extended sources by introducing a generalized time-reversal
framework, which identifies the optimal source pattern as the one that
maximizes the energy of the waves that are captured and reversed. In a
two-dimensional diffusive waveguide, we reconstruct the time-reversed wavefront
corresponding to this optimal source using spatiospectral shaping, leading to a
35-fold enhancement in peak transmitted power compared to an unmodulated pulse.
Internal spatiotemporal measurements reveal a ``loading and firing" process, in
which energy accumulates within the medium and then is released abruptly.
Moreover, time-reversing this burst enables deep energy delivery into the
scattering medium. Generalized time-reversal opens new possibilities for
short-pulse control in strongly-scattering media, with applications ranging
from optogenetics to random laser amplification.

that maximizes the distinctiveness of the generated colors. We demonstrate that
our design approach achieves strong color contrast between the generated
colors. The proposed multilayer design eliminates the need for subwavelength

results could lead to a new class of single-cell multicolor pixels which retain
each color without power consumption, making them particularly appealing for

Abstract: We study light propagation in an array of periodically curved waveguides
consisting of pairs of waveguides with out-of-phase oscillations of waveguide
centers. We compute the corresponding Floquet propagation constants and find
pseudocollapses where the Floquet bands shrink and, respectively, light
diffraction is significantly inhibited. When, in addition, the refractive index
of the waveguides in the array have quasiperiodic modulation in the transverse
direction, we establish the existence of Floquet modes localized in the
transverse direction and periodic in the longitudinal direction. With increase
of the depth of quasiperiodic modulation of the refractive index in the array,
the localized Floquet modes emerge near the pseudocollapse points of the
periodic array. In array with sufficiently high frequencies of waveguide
oscillations, the localized Floquet modes can exist even for weak quasiperiodic
modulation which is situated below the localization transition in the array of
straight waveguides.

Abstract: Toroidal pulses, also known as Focused or Flying Doughnuts (FDs), are
few-cycle pulses of doughnut-like topology. Originally proposed by Hellwarth
and Nouchi in 1996, they have recently been experimentally realized. Toroidal
pulses exhibit intriguing topological features, including skyrmionic field
configurations and extensive regions of energy backflow, while their
light-matter interactions have been associated with the excitation of toroidal
and non-radiating modes in matter. The non-separable nature of toroidal pulses,
encompassing both space-time and space-polarization couplings, positions them
as promising candidates for robust information and energy transport. However,
advancing their fundamental study and deployment in applications requires
practical characterization methods, particularly with respect to their
non-separability. In this work, we experimentally generate collimated optical
toroidal pulses and analyze their space-polarization and space-time couplings
using tomographic techniques. We quantify their degree of non-separability
through measures such as concurrence and fidelity, benchmarking against ideal
FD pulses. The reported results will be of interest to the fundamental study of
toroidal pulses and spatiotemporal structured light more broadly, enabling
applications in telecommunications, spectroscopy, metrology, and imaging.

Abstract: Polarization- and wavelength-sensitive absorbers for homogeneous
electromagnetic waves are crucial in photovoltaics, imaging and
telecommunications. Here, we report on an absorber selective to the topological
structure of light. An electromagnetic beam or pulse containing polarization
singularities can be fully dissipated by the absorber, while plane waves are
rejected regardless of their polarization. The absorber comprises a conical
mirror coaxial with the incident propagating beam, which the mirror converts
into a standing wave defined by the geometrical Pancharatnam-Berry phase
accumulated upon reflection on the mirror. If a "nanowire" absorber is placed
along the axis of the cone, singularly-polarized light can create an antinode
of the standing wave at the absorber and nearly perfect dissipation of the
light's energy is achievable regardless of the wavelength. The selective
absorber of topologically structured light is of interest for energy
harvesting, detection, filtering, and telecommunications applications.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities in optics for performing complex polarization manipulations, potentially with applications in quantum information processing and advanced photonic devices.

Abstract: The combination of two quarter-wave plates and one half-wave plate,

arbitrary polarization evolution on the higher-order Poincar\'{e} sphere.

*Kalpak Gupta,Dinh Hoang Tran,Sungsam Kang,Yongwoo Kwon,Seokchan Yoon,Jin Hee Hong,Ye-Ryoung Lee,Wonshik Choi*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR:  High-resolution optical microscopy struggles with decreasing resolution and contrast as imaging depth increases due to multiple light scattering. Conventional correction strategies often approximate the medium as one or a few discrete layers, which becomes ineffective in thick, volumetric tissues. This paper introduces an inverse-scattering framework that represents the entire volume as a superposition of angular deflectors. By focusing on narrow angular spread due to dominant forward scattering, the method captures most multiple scattering with fewer components. The framework solves the inverse problem by incorporating contributions from small to large deflection angles. Simulations and in vivo imaging through intact mouse skulls demonstrate the method's ability to reconstruct up to 121 angular components, converting approximately 80% of multiply scattered light into usable signal. This enables non-invasive visualization of osteocytes in the skull that were previously inaccessible using layer-based methods. The results establish the scattering-angle basis as a deterministic framework for imaging through complex media, paving the way for high-resolution microscopy deep inside living tissues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of maintaining high-resolution and contrast in optical microscopy as depth increases, a problem caused by multiple light scattering. Conventional methods, which assume a limited number of scattering layers, are found to be insufficient for thick tissues. The motivation behind the research is to develop a more effective framework for imaging through complex scattering media common in biological tissues.

Method: The proposed inverse-scattering framework represents the entire volume as a superposition of angular deflectors, each corresponding to scattering at a specific angle. Narrow angular spread due to dominant forward scattering allows most multiple scattering to be captured using relatively few components. The inverse problem is solved by incorporating contributions from small to large deflection angles. The method is validated through simulations and in vivo reflection-mode imaging through intact mouse skulls.

Result: The method successfully reconstructed up to 121 angular components from simulations and in vivo imaging, converting approximately 80% of multiply scattered light into usable signal. This resulted in non-invasive visualization of osteocytes in the skull, which were previously inaccessible using layer-based methods. The framework is shown to effectively address the limitations of conventional correction strategies in imaging through thick, volumetric tissues.

Conclusion: The scattering-angle basis presents a deterministic framework for imaging through complex media, significantly advancing the capabilities of optical microscopy in biological tissues. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for non-invasive visualization of previously challenging structures, particularly in intact mouse skulls, demonstrating the potential of this approach in fundamental and applied sciences.

Abstract: High-resolution optical microscopy has transformed biological imaging, yet
its resolution and contrast deteriorate with depth due to multiple light
scattering. Conventional correction strategies typically approximate the medium
as one or a few discrete layers. While effective in the presence of dominant
scattering layers, these approaches break down in thick, volumetric tissues,
where accurate modeling would require an impractically large number of layers.
To address this challenge, we introduce an inverse-scattering framework that
represents the entire volume as a superposition of angular deflectors, each
corresponding to scattering at a specific angle. This angular formulation is
particularly well suited to biological tissues, where narrow angular spread due
to the dominant forward scattering allow most multiple scattering to be
captured with relatively few components. Within this framework, we solve the
inverse problem by progressively incorporating contributions from small to
large deflection angles. Applied to simulations and in vivo reflection-mode
imaging through intact mouse skull, our method reconstructs up to 121 angular
components, converting ~80% of multiply scattered light into signal. This
enables non-invasive visualization of osteocytes in the skull that remain
inaccessible to existing layer-based methods. These results establish the
scattering-angle basis as a deterministic framework for imaging through complex
media, paving the way for high-resolution microscopy deep inside living
tissues.

Abstract: We demonstrate a grazing-incidence x-ray platform that simultaneously records
time-resolved grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) and
grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GID) from a femtosecond laser-irradiated
gold film above the melting threshold, with picosecond resolution at an x-ray
free-electron laser (XFEL). By tuning the x-ray incidence angle, the probe
depth is set to tens of nanometers, enabling depth-selective sensitivity to
near-surface dynamics. GISAXS resolves ultrafast changes in surface
nanomorphology (correlation length, roughness), while GID quantifies subsurface
lattice compression, grain orientation, melting, and recrystallization. The
approach overcomes photon-flux limitations of synchrotron grazing-incidence
geometries and provides stringent, time-resolved benchmarks for complex
theoretical models of ultrafast laser-matter interaction and warm dense matter.
Looking ahead, the same depth-selective methodology is well suited to inertial
confinement fusion (ICF): it can visualize buried-interface perturbations and
interfacial thermal resistance on micron to sub-micron scales that affect
instability seeding and burn propagation.

Result: The study successfully integrated Er3+ emitters into CMOS-compatible metasurfaces, achieving efficient spontaneous emission under different temperatures and excitation techniques. This could lead to scalable and controllable optical components for advanced technologies.

Conclusion: The research opens up new possibilities for using Er3+-based components in scalable and flexible optical and quantum technologies, leveraging advanced fabrication techniques like MO epitaxy and CMOS integration.

Abstract: Erbium ($\text{Er}^{3+}$) emitters are relevant for optical applications due
to their narrow emission line directly in the telecom C-band due to the
${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{13/2}}$ $\rightarrow$
${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{15/2}}$ transition at 1.54 $\mu$m. Additionally
they are promising candidates for future quantum technologies when embedded in
thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) to achieve fabrication scalability and
CMOS compatibility. In this paper we integrate $\text{Er}^{3+}$ emitters in SOI
metasurfaces made of closely spaced array of nanodisks, to study their
spontaneous emission via room and cryogenic temperature confocal microscopy,
off-resonance and in-resonance photoluminescence excitation at room temperature
and time resolved spectroscopy. This work demonstrates the possibility to adopt
CMOS-compatible and fabrication scalable metasurfaces for controlling and
improving the collection efficiency of the spontaneous emission from the

Abstract: This paper presents an extensive survey of the thermal radiation properties

Abstract: Photonic neuromorphic computing offers compelling advantages in power

silicon microring resonator (MRR) networks. These integrated photonic circuits
enable compact, high-throughput neuromorphic computing by simultaneously
exploiting spatial, temporal, and wavelength dimensions. This work advances the

demonstrate the system's effectiveness on two widely used image classification
benchmarks, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, by encoding images directly into time
sequences. In particular, we enhance the computational performance of a linear
readout classifier within the reservoir computing paradigm through the
strategic use of multiple physical output ports, diverse laser wavelengths, and
varied input power levels. Moreover, we achieve substantially improved
accuracies in a single-pixel classification setting without relying on digital

Abstract: Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique
opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction
and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or
lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moir\'e potential that
significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional
complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have
enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such
moir\'e-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing
both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we
address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body
model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully
accounting for the moir\'e potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band
structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap
excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive
behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise
to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics
creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms
behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton
transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for
next-generation moir\'e-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates high tunability and non-volatile optical memory in 2D ReS2 using electrically controlled ferroelectric field-effect transistors made with AlScN. The system achieves near-unity linear dichroism (LD) tunability at room temperature and maintains stable optical states for over 12,000 seconds without bias, opening up applications in photonic devices and telecommunications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to advance next-generation integrated photonic elements by achieving electrically tunable and non-volatile optical properties. This is significant for practical device applications and future technologies requiring stable and dynamic optical functionality.

Method: The researchers used ferroelectric field-effect transistors with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) to create programmable optical anisotropy in two-dimensional ReS2. They employed a combination of experimental characterization (such as reflectance measurements and optical anisotropy analysis) and computational modeling (using ab initio calculations) to understand the underlying mechanisms.

Result: The key results include the high tunability and non-volatile optical memory demonstrated in the system. The ReS2 material exhibits near-unity linear dichroism tunability at room temperature, and the optical states are remarkably stable, persisting for more than 12,000 seconds without applied bias. This represents a significant breakthrough in achieving true non-volatile optical memory in 2D materials.

Conclusion: This study opens up new possibilities for designing voltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices and integrated optical systems with dynamic polarization control. The combination of ReS2, AlScN gate electrodes, and the ferroelectric-semiconductor coupling mechanism offers a robust platform for future research and practical applications in photonics and related fields.

Abstract: Electrically tunable linear dichroism (LD) with non-volatile properties
represents a critical yet elusive feature for next-generation integrated
photonic elements in practical device architectures. Here, we demonstrate
record-breaking, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in two-dimensional
ReS2 via ferroelectric gating with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Our
ferroelectric field-effect transistors achieve near-unity (~95%) LD tunability
of differential reflectance at room temperature--the highest reported for any
electrically controlled 2D optical system. Crucially, the programmed optical
states exhibit exceptional retention exceeding 12,000 seconds without applied
bias, enabling true non-volatile optical memory. Through combined experimental
characterization and ab initio calculations, we reveal that ferroelectric
polarization switching induces substantial asymmetric charge transfer to ReS2,
selectively populating conduction band states and triggering structural
distortions that dramatically enhance optical anisotropy in the "up"
polarization state while leaving the "down" state unperturbed. This
ferroelectric-semiconductor coupling provides a universal platform for
voltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices with dynamic
polarization control, addressing critical needs in integrated photonics as well
as programmable far-field optics and telecommunications infrastructure.

Abstract: We demonstrate an integrated photonic circuit based on feed forward photonic

filter functions. We investigate a subset of the available filter functions,
demonstrating that a N = 4 input triangular mesh with M = 3 layers may be
operated via self-configuration algorithms to filter M arbitrary wavelengths
from a given input spectrum. The tunable nature of the architecture enables
preconfigured filter functions to be swept in the spectral domain continuously
over the free spectral range of the device. This removes any strict
requirements between the design parameters of the architecture and the center
wavelength of a desired filter function. With this architecture, we
experimentally demonstrate arbitrary wavelength rejection filters with
contrasts as deep as 40 dB. Further, by intentionally selecting the center
wavelengths of each filter function to lie along a wavelength grid we
demonstrate deep wavelength division demultiplexing (DWDM) with inter-channel
crosstalk between -25 dB and -40 dB. Unlike typical DWDM systems, in this
architecture the center wavelength of each channel is not fixed at fabrication
and instead may be swept or reordered arbitrarily. This device demonstrates
advantages over typical methods for DWDM, Raman spectroscopy, and correlation
spectroscopy as well as other applications.

Abstract: It is challenging to build scalable quantum processors capable of both
parallel control and local operation. As a promising platform to overcome this
challenge, optical lattices offer exceptional parallelism. However, it has been
struggling with precise local operations due to relatively narrow lattice
spacings. Here, we introduce a new quantum processor incorporating orbit-qubit
encoding and internal states (as auxiliary degrees of freedom) to achieve
spatially selective operations together with parallel control. With this
processor, we generate one-dimensional and two-dimensional cluster states using
minimal layers of controlled-Z gates. We experimentally detect the multipartite
entanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits
through direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite
non-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum
computation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates,
highlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations. Our results establish
orbit-qubit optical lattices as a scalable quantum processing architecture,
opening new pathways for quantum computation applications.

TL;DR: 研究了非平衡捕获玻色–爱因斯坦凝聚系统在交替场作用下的动态转变，发现非平衡态可以通过共振和非共振两种方式实现。在共振激发下，系统会产生多种相干模式，频率与系统某些转换频率匹配。玻色系统通过Josephson效应表现出两种效应：分离效应和内部Josephson效应。数学处理在这两种情况下相似。我们着重分析了内部Josephson效应，发现非线性相干模式下存在丰富的动力学现象，如Rabi振荡、Josephson效应和混沌运动。Josephson效应下的动态转变类似于平衡系统中的相变。玻色Josephson效应不仅适用于弱相互作用系统，也可在强相互作用的超流体中实现。强烈非共振激发会产生多种非平衡态，包括涡旋芽、涡环、涡丝、液滴涡丝和波涡。非平衡态可通过有效温度、有效夫琅禾费数和动 scalings来分类和区分。

Abstract: The paper presents a survey of some dynamical transitions in nonequilibrium
trapped Bose-condensed systems subject to the action of alternating fields.
Nonequilibrium states of trapped systems can be realized in two ways, resonant
and nonresonant. Under resonant excitation, several coherent modes are
generated by external alternating fields, whose frequencies are tuned to
resonance with some transition frequencies of the trapped system. A Bose system
of trapped atoms with Bose-Einstein condensate can display two types of the
Josephson effect, the standard one, when the system is separated into two or
more parts in different locations or when there are no any separation barriers,
but the system becomes nonuniform due to the coexistence of several coherent
modes interacting with each other, which is termed internal Josephson effect.
The mathematics in both these cases is similar. We concentrate on the internal
Josephson effect. Systems with nonlinear coherent modes demonstrate rich
dynamics, including Rabi oscillations, Josephson effect, and chaotic motion.
Under Josephson effect, there exist dynamic transitions that are similar to
phase transitions in equilibrium systems. The bosonic Josephson effect is shown
to be realizable not only for weakly interacting systems, but also in
superfluids, with not necessarily weak interactions. Sufficiently strong
nonresonant excitation can generate several types of nonequilibrium states
comprising vortex germs, vortex rings, vortex lines, vortex turbulence, droplet
turbulence, and wave turbulence. Nonequilibrium states can be characterized and
distinguished by effective temperature, effective Fresnel number, and dynamic
scaling laws.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phases and spin-scissors dynamics of binary
Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a twisted two-dimensional harmonic trap.
The ground state hosts three distinct phases-phase-separated, polarized, and
phase-mixed-determined by the Rabi coupling, interaction ratio G (between
inter-component and intra-component interactions), and spin-twisting which
induces edge-localized polarization through position-dependent detuning. In the
phase-mixed regime, the ground state is characterized by a finite spin-scissors
susceptibility and can be accurately described using local density
approximation. In the dynamics, the system exhibits stable periodic beating in
the phase-mixed state for G<1. For G>1, its evolution progresses from beat
damping (phase-separated state) to polarized relaxation (polarized state),
finally reaching stable periodic beating (phase-mixed state) after a finite
waiting time. The dependence of the waiting time contrasts sharply with the
monotonic behavior of one-dimensional spin-dipole dynamics, revealing
qualitatively distinct mechanisms governed by geometry and interactions. In
summary, these results establish a unified link between ground-state properties
and nonequilibrium responses in twisted spinor condensates, offering a
versatile platform for exploring spin-related quantum many-body phenomena.

Abstract: The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a
variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such
topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations, which for spinful
systems are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a
Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by
nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized
$\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body
Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We
further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic
excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion
is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground
state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around
$\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on
local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is
directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new
pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both
ultracold atom and electronic systems.

Abstract: In clean two-dimensional (2D) systems, electrons are expected to
self-organize into a regular lattice, a Wigner crystal, when their mutual
Coulomb repulsion overwhelms kinetic energy. Understanding the Wigner crystal
at zero magnetic field is a long-sought goal in physics, thanks to its
fundamental simplicity and possible connection to the density-driven
metal-insulator transition. To date, evidence for such a crystal has been
reported across various platforms. However, the AC conductivity of a zero-field
Wigner crystal, a key observable characterizing its electrodynamics, has never
been measured. Here, we develop an ultrasensitive on-chip terahertz (THz)
spectroscopy technique to probe the AC conductivity in electrostatically gated
monolayer MoSe2 encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observe a sub-THz
resonance corresponding to the pinning mode of a zero-field Wigner crystal,
whose frequency is orders of magnitude higher than those under high magnetic
fields. Using the pinning mode as an indicator, we reveal that moderate
disorder notably stabilizes the Wigner crystal. With increasing density towards
melting, we find that the pinning mode of the Wigner crystal coexists with a
growing Drude component characteristic of an electron liquid, and the
competition between these two components in the conductivity spectra leads to
the insulator-metal transition of the 2D electron system. Our findings not only
elucidate the low-energy electrodynamics of a zero-field Wigner crystal, but
also establish on-chip THz spectroscopy as a powerful probe for correlated
quantum phases in two-dimensional materials.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets offer a promising platform for
pushing skyrmion technology to the single-layer limit with high tunability.
While Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often recognized as central to
skyrmion formation, their stability, collapse, and topological transition in 2D
materials remain largely unexplored. In particular, the effect of higher-order
exchange interactions (HOI) on these phenomena is unknown. Here, using
first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we report a new
topological transition generated by HOI, which we term 'ferric transition', in
single-layer MnSeTe. Surprisingly, skyrmion stability and collapse remain
largely unaffected by HOI due to the dominant role of DMI near the saddle
point, whereas the Bloch point is strongly modified, giving rise to this novel
transition. This mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the well-known radial
and chimera transitions. Moreover, we predict that Janus MnSeTe exhibits
remarkably high skyrmion energy barriers due to its strong DMI, among the
highest reported for intrinsic 2D magnets. Our findings unveil an unexpected
role of HOI in skyrmion topological transitions and establish Janus MnSeTe as a
robust platform for 2D skyrmionics.

Abstract: Low dimensional quantum fluids, where one can probe the effects of enhanced
thermal and quantum fluctuations on macroscopic quantum wavefunctions, can be
experimentally realized through transverse physical confinement of superfluid
helium on scales smaller than the coherence length. Reaching this scale is
difficult, requiring confinement in single or multiple pores with nanometer
radii. Porous silicates such as MCM-41 have a pore radius larger than the
coherence length of 4He, and in this work we systematically explore the
possibility of pre-plating pores with different elements to reduce the pore
size without localizing the confined superfluid. Through a direct solution of
the few-body Schrodinger equation combined with quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, we explore the behavior of helium confined inside cylindrical
nanopores for a range of pre-plating elements, including rare gases and alkali
metals. For rare gases, we find that helium remains strongly attracted to the
pore walls and any atoms in the core form an incompressible liquid. For alkali
metals such as Cs, weak interactions between helium and the pre-plating
material prevent localization near the walls and enable delocalization in the
pore center. Our results extend previous results for helium wetting on flat two
dimensional coated substrates to the curved geometry inside nanopores, and
demonstrate that alkali pre-plated nanopores may enable a tunable
one-dimensional confined quantum liquid of helium.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin dynamics in hole-based quantum dot qubits demands
high-fidelity simulations that capture realistic device geometries, material
interfaces, and self-consistent electrostatics. Here, we present a
comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin
qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to
prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schr\"odinger
treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a
four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions,
wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device
structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction
localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify "sweet
spots" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is
minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon
coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with
strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near
$B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing
spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design
guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV
semiconductors.

Abstract: Magnetic interactions between impurity spins play a crucial role in
determining magnetic configurations in spintronic systems. Using a Green's
function formalism, we investigate Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
exchange interactions between two localized spins mediated by a two-dimensional
electron gas arising from two spin-polarized bands with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (RSOC) and altermagnetic dispersion. We analyze two distinct regimes:
(a) strong out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, and (b) weak in-plane order. For
out-of-plane magnetization, the Heisenberg, Ising, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) exchange interaction terms exhibit oscillatory spatial modulations and
asymptotically decay as $1/R^{2}$ with impurity separation. Besides, all
exchange terms display beating-like patterns that can be tuned via the exchange
coupling strength between conduction electrons and ferromagnetic ordering. The
DM vector lies within the two-dimensional plane, with the DM interaction being
odd in the RSOC strength, oscillatory, and increasing in magnitude with RSOC
strength. In contrast, it is even in the out-of-plane Zeeman field strength and
oscillatory. Furthermore, the Heisenberg interaction exhibits a non-linear
dependence on the altermagnetic band parameter. In the case of weak in-plane
order, the Heisenberg exchange interaction shows a non-linear dependence on the
in-plane exchange coupling strength.

Abstract: To encode quantum information in semiconductor spin qubits, voltage pulses
are necessary for initialization, gate operation, and readout. However, these
pulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate
fidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown.
Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in
Si/SiGe quantum dots. We find that the TLFs are susceptible to pulse heating.
The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on
the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also
generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that
electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We
hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could
mitigate the heating.

Motivation: Understanding correlated electronic states in twisted trilayer graphene is crucial for advancing materials science and graphene-based devices.

Method: Magnetotransport experiments on alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a 5° twist angle were conducted to investigate electronic and quantum Hall states.

Result: The experiments revealed a strong electron-hole asymmetry, Quantum Spin Hall-like edge modes at neutral filling, and an Interlayer Quantum Hall state at ν=-1, which results from complex interlayer interactions.

Conclusion: This work offers a systematic exploration of correlated quantum states in twisted trilayer graphene, potentially guiding the development of spin-controlled devices and quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure
through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform
for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted
trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an
electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent
potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three
low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes
to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin
Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed
resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top
layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic
quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum
Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved
edge transport and excitonic order.

Abstract: Electrons of $d$-symmetry in a kagome lattice are considered which interact
with non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit
coupling. The non-collinearity of spin texture gives rise to non-relativistic
spin splitting and the associated intrinsic Berry curvature. The integral of
the latter over the Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial for non-coplanar (canted)
non-collinear spin order even without explicit on-site or transfer spin-orbit
coupling. That gives rise to a nonzero (scalar) spin chirality, and a record
value for the Chern number of $C=\pm 5$ can appear when the Fermi level is in
an appropriate gap for isotropic electron hopping integrals, or nearly
isotropic ones. The numerical results for this topological quantum anomalous
Hall effect are supported by an analytical formula. It is possible to split the
$C=\pm 5$ plateau into different possible nonzero values for the Chern number
by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transitions between Hall
plateaus can be driven by flipping the Zeeman-like exchange field or
controlling the onsite energies, alluding to the potential of this system to
quantum information.

Abstract: Establishing a mapping between nanocatalysts structure and their catalytic
properties is essential for efficient design. To this end, we demonstrate the
accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and
challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for
the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic
model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's
structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the
surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible
experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function.
Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in
tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and
Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising
more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few
thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates orbital angular momentum pumping by Ni in heterostructures. Orbital pumping shows no significant effect on damping, while spin pumping is observed. This indicates that orbital pumping by Ni might be less significant than previously thought, and further theoretical understanding is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the role of Ni in angular momentum pumping, specifically distinguishing between spin and orbital contributions. This is important for understanding ferromagnetic devices and Minority Contributions in spintronics.

Method: The study compares Gilbert damping in FeV/Nb and FeV-Ni/Nb heterostructures as a function of the Nb sink thickness. Spin pumping is attributed to the increase in damping in the FeV/Nb system, while the FeV-Ni/Nb system shows no such increase, suggesting no orbital pumping.

Result: The main finding is that Ni does not contribute significantly to orbital angular momentum pumping. This challenges previous assumptions about Ni's role in heterostructures and highlights the need for further theoretical work to explain strong orbitronic effects.

Conclusion: The results suggest that Ni's orbital pumping is minimal, and spin pumping is the dominant mechanism in these systems. This indicates a need for reevaluation of previous interpretations and more comprehensive theoretical models for understanding such effects in Ni-based heterostructures.

Abstract: Excited ferromagnets can pump spin angular momentum, along with possibly
orbital angular momentum. Among elemental ferromagnets, Ni has been proposed to
exhibit substantial orbital pumping relative to spin pumping. Here, we search
for a signature of orbital pumping by Ni, specifically by comparing
out-of-plane ferromagnetic resonance in heterostructures without Ni (FeV/Nb)
and with Ni (FeV-Ni/Nb). The FeV/Nb series shows a clear increase in Gilbert
damping with the Nb sink thickness, attributed to spin pumping from FeV to Nb.
Surprisingly, the FeV-Ni/Nb series exhibits no such damping increase, revealing
no significant spin or orbital pumping from Ni to Nb. Our results offer a fresh
perspective on angular-momentum transfer in Ni-based heterostructures,
suggesting that the interpretation of some strong orbitronic effects may
require further consideration.

Conclusion: The proposed experimental methodology offers a promising alternative for probing energy barrier inhomogeneity at metal/semiconductor interfaces with reduced time and effort compared to microscopic survey methods.

Abstract: We propose an experimental methodology for probing the energy barrier
inhomogeneity at the metal/semiconductor interface without the need for
time-consuming microscopic survey. It is based on the known statistical nature
of the interfacial energy barrier and the use of planar tunnel junction as an
array of parallelly-connected ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM)
tips. In order to analyze a lump of local BEEM signals, we incorporate the Tung
model into the Bell-Kaiser theory. To validate our theoretical strategies, we
investigate the interfacial energy barrier inhomogeneity of Pt/4H-SiC(0001)
junction as a model system.

Abstract: Equilibrium interlayer exciton condensation is common in bilayer quantum Hall
systems and is characterized by spontaneous phase coherence between isolated
layers. It has been predicted that similar physics can occur in the absence of
a magnetic field in some two-dimensional semiconductor bilayers. In this work
we consider the case of two transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers
separated by a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer or multilayer. The
hBN layers suppress tunneling between the TMD layers so that phase coherence is
spontaneous when it is present. When twisted, the hBN layers also form a
ferroelectric moir\'e pattern that applies opposite triangular-lattice
modulation potentials to the two TMD layers. We show via mean-field theory that
at total hole filling per moir\'e unit cell $\nu=1$, this geometry can favor a
chiral p-wave exciton condensate state in which the quantum anomalous Hall
effect coexists with counter-flow superfluidity. We present a mean-field phase
diagram for TMD hole bilayers modulated by twisted hBN, discuss the conditions
needed for the realization of the p-wave condensate state, and propose
experiments that could confirm its presence.

QPI in twisted bilayer graphene using real-space tight-binding calculations
combined with the kernel polynomial method, which agrees excellently with the
form factor norm obtained from the continuum Hamiltonian. The QPI signals,
displaying a chiral structure, reveal all distinct interference processes
between states near the Dirac points. We propose pseudospin textures of twisted

provide microscopic insights into electronic eigenstates of twisted bilayer

which governs the material's quantum geometry and many-body states.

Abstract: Quantum Hall systems host quasiparticles demonstrating correlated electron
physics and non-trivial quantum statistics. Excitonic phases, archetypical for
interaction effect, have attracted significant interest in recent years in
double-layer quantum Hall systems where spatially separated electrons and holes
form bosonic condensate through Coulomb interaction. Here, employing the
approach of quantum Hall antidot with two spatially separated edge channels, we
demonstrate a new type of quantum Hall quasiparticle exciton which represents a
quantum-coherent bound state of an electron and a hole situated on their
corresponding edges coupled through intralayer tunneling and Coulomb
interaction. Quantum-coherent dynamics of the exciton is reflected in the
observed evolution of the position and magnitude of the antidot conductance
peaks around the electron-hole resonance. The quantum Hall antidot setup allows
localization and electrical tuning of individual quantum Hall excitons. Quantum
superposition of vacuum- and electron-hole pairing states is observed through
the gate-dependent tunneling conductance of the antidot. Modeling the
electron-hole pair as a coupled two-level system, semi-quantitative
understanding of experimental observations is achieved. This work opens avenues
for creating quantum systems of multiple quantum Hall quasiparticles.

Abstract: Nanofluidic memristors promise brain-inspired information processing with
ions, yet their microscopic origin remains debated. So far, ionic memory has
been attributed to ion-specific interactions, dynamic wetting, chemical
reactions or mechanical deformations, yet typically without direct evidence.
Here, by combining operando interferometric imaging with electrokinetic
measurements, we directly visualize voltage-induced blistering of the confining
walls of two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels, as key origin of memristive
hysteresis. We identify two distinct classes of blisters: unidirectional,
driven by electrostatic forces on surface charges, and bidirectional, arising
from osmotic pressure due to concentration polarization. This mechanistic
framework explains device evolution and device-to-device variability, and
reframes stochastic blistering as a functional design element. Our results
constitute a direct proof of electromechanical coupling as a robust pathway to
ionic memory in 2D nanochannels and open routes toward high-performance ionic
memristors and electrically actuated nanofluidic valves.

Conclusion: The paper reports on the design, characterization, and application of a SHMR sensor showing high performance characteristics, making a significant contribution to the field of spintronic sensors.

Abstract: We present a spin Hall magnetoresistance sensor based on a NiFe/Pt multiring
bridge structure, which exhibits high sensitivity and good linearity in two
perpendicular directions within the sensor plane. Under DC excitation, it
responds linearly to magnetic field perpendicular to the current direction,
whereas AC excitation enables a linear response with near-zero offset to
magnetic field aligned with the current direction, driven by spin-orbit torque
effect. Moreover, the AC excitation effectively mitigates low-frequency 1/f
noise down to sub-microvolt per sqrt(Hz) at 1 Hz. Systematic investigations
have been performed to optimize the NiFe thickness while keeping the Pt

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The moir\'e superlattice system provides an excellent platform for exploring
various novel quantum phenomena. To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated
and topological states emerging from moir\'e superlattices, one usually adopts
an effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron
effects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate
continuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\'e
superlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work,
we develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in
principle applicable for arbitrary moir\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable
to any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic
properties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain
invariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external
inputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the
coupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition
enables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model
using a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we
design a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density
functional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer
MoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately
reproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures,
charge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist
angles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles.
Our work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic
properties of moir\'e superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future
theoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moir\'e
superlattice systems.

Motivation: Understanding nonlinear electrical responses in non-Hermitian systems and connecting quantum geometry to transport phenomena.

Method: One-dimensional and two-dimensional non-Hermitian models are used to demonstrate the relationship between quantum geometric tensor and nonlinear dynamics.

Result: Non-Hermitian transport is significantly affected by wavepacket width, a feature absent in Hermitian systems.

Conclusion: A unifying framework is established to link quantum state geometry to observable transport, offering pathways for exploiting geometric effects in topological devices and engineered materials.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) governs
nonlinear electrical responses in systems with a spectral line gap. The quantum
metric, which is a component of the QGT and takes complex values in
non-Hermitian systems, generates an intrinsic nonlinear conductivity
independent of the scattering time, while the complex Berry curvature induces a
wavepacket-width-dependent response. Using one-dimensional and two-dimensional
non-Hermitian models, we establish a universal link between nonlinear dynamics
and the QGT, thereby connecting quantum state geometry to observable transport
phenomena. Crucially, our analysis indicates that the wavepacket width
significantly affects non-Hermitian transport -- a feature absent in Hermitian
systems. This framework unifies non-Hermitian response theory by revealing how
geometric degrees of freedom encode transport in open and synthetic quantum
matter. Our results bridge fundamental quantum geometry with emergent
functionality, offering pathways to exploit geometric effects in topological
devices and engineered materials.

Motivation: Research in solid-state quantum computation relies heavily on accurate and high-fidelity detection mechanisms. The ability to detect charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs), particularly in bilayer graphene systems, is crucial for the development of qubits and quantum bits (qubits). This paper addresses the challenge of performing high-bandwidth, radio-frequency charge detection in such systems, which is essential for advancing scalable and reliable quantum computing technologies.

Method: The authors employ a bilayer graphene quantum dots platform combined with a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC) for charge detection. The device design focuses on suppressing screening effects to enhance sensitivity. The QPC is strategically arranged to maximize readout contrast between neighboring coupled QDs (one electron and one hole). The readout scheme is applied to a single-particle electron-hole double QD system, enabling time-resolved detection of charge states and investigation of how magnetic fields influence tunneling rates between QDs.

Result: The presented system demonstrates high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots with enhanced readout contrast. By applying the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD, the researchers successfully perform time-resolved detection of charge states in individual quantum dots. Additionally, the system shows how magnetic field strengths affect the tunneling rates between neighboring QDs. These results highlight a high-fidelity readout capability for individual spin and valley states, which is vital for the operation of spin, valley, or combined spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene systems.

Conclusion: The described method represents a significant advancement in high-fidelity charge detection for quantum dots, particularly in bilayer graphene systems. This capability enhances the precision of reading spin and valley states, which is fundamental for the development of quantum computing devices like qubits based on spin, valley, or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene. Future work could aim to extend this system to other two-dimensional materials and improve the scalability of quantum computing architectures.

Result: 单个ANC-SHNO具有广泛的频率调谐范围，可以控制非线性行为，表明SHNO具有强大的自振特性。一对SHNO通过偶极耦合实现相互同步，取决于偏流条件，可以实现同相或反相唤醒，且存在幅度相关性，当幅度平衡时可同时实现同相和反相，幅度失衡则导致反相同步和弱振荡器抑制。

Conclusion: ANC-SHNO的设计提供了构建可缩放振荡器阵列和神经形态计算架构的路线，为探索非厄米自旋电子学动力学提供了实验平台。

Abstract: We propose an asymmetric-nanoconstriction (ANC) design of spin-Hall
nano-oscillators (SHNOs) and investigate mutual synchronization of a pair of
such devices using micromagnetic simulations. The ANC geometry enables strong
dipolar coupling at sub-50 nm separations while preserving independent current
bias for each oscillator. We first characterize the auto-oscillation of a
single ANC-SHNO, revealing a broad frequency tuning range and a
field-controlled crossover between negative and positive nonlinearities. We
then demonstrate that two such oscillators can mutually synchronize solely via
dipolar stray fields, without electrical or spin-wave coupling. Depending on
the bias conditions, the coupled pair exhibits robust in-phase (0{\deg}) or
out-of-phase (180{\deg}) locking. Notably, we find a bias-dependent amplitude
correlation: when the oscillators sustain comparable amplitudes, both in-phase
and out-of-phase synchronization are accessible, whereas amplitude imbalance
drives the system into an out-of-phase state accompanied by suppression of the
weaker oscillator. By combining strong conservative coupling with independent
frequency and gain control, the ANC-SHNO platform provides a scalable route
toward phased oscillator arrays, neuromorphic computing architectures, and
experimental exploration of non-Hermitian spintronic dynamics.

TL;DR:  Ramos que many-body interactions are important in describing skyrmion behavior in helimagnets, particularly in the conical phase. The binding energy of skyrmions depends on film thickness, and while pairwise interactions dominate in the ferromagnetic phase, many-body interactions are critical in the conical phase, with higher-order terms becoming relevant under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of skyrmions in helimagnets is crucial for advancing spintronic devices and magnetic memory technologies, making a detailed analysis of their interactions essential.

Method: Micromagnetic simulations were performed to separate the contributions of exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and Zeeman interactions to the skyrmion-skyrmion pair potential.

Result: The binding energy of skyrmions within the conical phase significantly depends on film thickness. Three-body interactions are substantial for small skyrmion clusters, while four-body interactions become relevant only in the presence of small magnetic fields. These higher-order contributions diminish as the system approaches the ferromagnetic phase.

Conclusion: Realistic modeling of skyrmion interactions requires incorporating many-body terms to accurately describe skyrmion crystals and to guide the development of strategies for controlling skyrmion phases and dynamics.

Abstract: Many-body interactions strongly influence the structure, stability, and
dynamics of condensed-matter systems, from atomic lattices to interacting
quasi-particles such as superconducting vortices. Here, we investigate
theoretically the pairwise and many-body interaction terms among skyrmions in
helimagnets, considering both the ferromagnetic and conical spin backgrounds.
Using micromagnetic simulations, we separate the exchange,
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and Zeeman contributions to the skyrmion-skyrmion pair
potential, and show that the binding energy of skyrmions within the conical
phase depends strongly on the film thickness. For small skyrmion clusters in
the conical phase, three-body interactions make a substantial contribution to
the cohesive energy, comparable to that of pairwise terms, while four-body
terms become relevant only at small magnetic fields. As the system approaches
the ferromagnetic phase, these higher-order contributions vanish, and the
interactions become essentially pairwise. Our results indicate that realistic
models of skyrmion interactions in helimagnets in the conical phase must
incorporate many-body terms to accurately capture the behavior of skyrmion
crystals and guide strategies for controlling skyrmion phases and dynamics.

Abstract: Ji etal [New J. Phys. 26, 093014 (2024)] established a direct link between
the photoionization cross section and the attosecond time delay near Cooper
minima (CM) in the valence shells of noble-gas atoms. This link is based on the
analytic properties of the ionization amplitude in the complex plane of the
photoelectron energy, and is particularly sensitive to the winding number of
the amplitude around the origin of the complex energy plane. Here, we
demonstrate an analogous relation for photoionization of the valence $ns$
shells of alkali-metal atoms (AMA), from Na ($n=3$) to Cs ($n=6$), as well as
alkaline-earth-metal atoms (AEMA), from Mg ($n=3$) to Ba ($n=6$). To this end,
we employ a fully relativistic formalism that separates the two complementary
$ns_{1/2} \to Ep_{1/2}$ and $Ep_{3/2}$ ionization channels. Each of these
channels exhibits a phase variation close to $\pi$, but in opposite directions,
near their respective Cooper minima. This phase variation vanishes in a
nonrelativistic formulation, where the two channels become degenerate. For AMA,
due to the threshold proximity of the CM, the universal Coulomb contribution to
the time delay must be subtracted. The remaining component of the time delay is
target-specific, angular-dependent, and accessible through comparative
measurements.

Method: It employed theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to investigate Rabi oscillations in optically thick atomic clouds under high-intensity light.

Result: The key result is the prediction of a dynamical displacement in Rabi oscillations, which scales quadratically with optical depth but decreases with increasing pump power.

Conclusion: This research provides new insights into controlling and exploiting Rabi oscillations in dense atomic systems, which could enhance metrological and computational applications.

Abstract: Cold atoms are promising platforms for metrology and quantum computation, yet
their many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. We here investigate Rabi
oscillations from optically-thick cold clouds, driven by high-intensity
coherent light. A dynamical displacement from the atomic resonance is
predicted, which can be detected through the collective Rabi oscillations of
the atomic ensemble. Different from linear-optics shifts, this dynamical
displacement grows quadratically with the optical depth, yet it reduces with
increasing pump power as dipole-dipole interactions are less effective. This
modification may be particularly important for Ramsey spectroscopy, when strong
pulses and optically dense samples are used.

Abstract: Arrays of neutral atoms present a promising system for quantum computing,
quantum sensors, and other applications, several of which would profit from the
ability to load, cool, and image the atoms in a finite magnetic field. In this
work, we develop a technique to image and prepare $^{87}$Rb atom arrays in a
finite magnetic field by combining EIT cooling with fluorescence imaging. We
achieve 99.6(3)% readout fidelity at 98.2(3)% survival probability and up to
68(2)% single-atom stochastic loading probability. We further develop a model
to predict the survival probability, which also agrees well with several other
atom array experiments. Our technique cools both the axial and radial
directions, and will enable future continuously-operated neutral atom quantum
processors and quantum sensors.

Abstract: We present a geometric interpretation of the hyperfine Breit--Rabi
eigenvalues and eigenvectors in alkali atoms after reformulating the standard
solution into a compact form. In this picture, the nuclear magnetic moment has
a polar angle fixed by the total projection quantum number. In contrast, the
electron magnetic moment anti-aligns or aligns with an effective field formed
by both the external magnetic flux density and the nuclear field, which
simultaneously sets the mixing angle of the eigenvectors. This geometric view
offers intuitive insight into the structure of the solutions.
