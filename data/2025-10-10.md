### [1] [Effect of non-Fourier heat transport on temperature distribution in High Bandwidth Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07691)
*Zhihao Zhou,Yu He,Shixian Liu,Lina Yang,Nuo Yang*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 研究在高速记忆模块（HBM）中的非Fourier热传导影响了热行为，使用蒙特卡洛方法求解声子玻尔兹曼输运方程，指出非Fourier效应会导致更高温度，且芯片间层的声子传输率极大影响散热。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高速记忆模块在芯片设计中的重要性增加，理解和优化其热管理机制成为关键。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛方法求解声子玻尔兹曼输运方程。

Result: 非Fourier热传导导致热结温升59.8K，且芯片间层声子传输率变化带来高达56.6K的温升。

Conclusion: 研究结果为HBM系统的优化设计提供了更精确的热管理依据。

Abstract: High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), as a key development trend in future memory chip
technology, significantly enhances computer performance. At the same time, the
thermal challenges arising from its stacked architecture have drawn
considerable attention. Most existing studies on HBM thermal management are
based on Fourier's law, neglecting the non-Fourier effects introduced by the
micro/nanoscale structures within HBM. In this study, the Monte Carlo method
(MC) is employed to solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and
investigate the impact of non-Fourier heat transport on the thermal behavior of
HBM structures. The results reveal that non-Fourier heat transport leads to a
junction temperature that is 59.8 K higher than that predicted by Fourier's
law. Furthermore, it is found that the phonon transmittance at the chip
interlayers has a severe impact on heat dissipation, with the temperature
variation reaching up to 56.6 K. These findings provide more accurate thermal
insights, which are critical for the optimized design of HBM systems.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates tandem solar cells and demonstrates that they have better efficiency and stability than single-junction cells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving the stability of perovskite-organic tandem solar cells (P-O TSCs) and how they can achieve better efficiency and long-term stability compared to single-junction cells.

Method: The study uses experimental investigation of p-i-n P-O TSCs with a simplified C60/ALD SnOx/PEDOT: PSS interconnecting layer. The researchers measure the device's efficiency and stability over time.

Result: The study finds that tandem cells achieve an average efficiency of 25.12% and a hero efficiency of 25.5%. The cells demonstrate exceptional long-term stability, retaining over 91% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of operation and showing minimal fatigue after 86 cycles.

Conclusion: The research establishes that tandem solar cells with organic and inorganic layers can achieve better efficiency and long-term stability than single-junction cells, making them a promising option for next-generation thin-film photovoltaics.

Abstract: Perovskite-organic tandem solar cells (P-O TSCs) hold great promise for
next-generation thin-film photovoltaics, with steadily improving power
conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the development of optimal
interconnecting layers (ICLs) remains one major challenge for further
efficiency gains, and progress in understanding the improved long-term
stability of P-O tandem configuration has been lagging. In this study, we
experimentally investigate the enhanced stability of p-i-n P-O TSCs employing a
simplified C60/atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) SnOx/PEDOT: PSS ICL without an
additional charge recombination layer (CRL), which achieve an averaged
efficiency of 25.12% and a hero efficiency of 25.5%. Our finding discovers that
the recrystallization of C60, a widely used electron transport layer in
perovskite photovoltaics, leads to the formation of grain boundaries during
operation, which act as migration channels for the interdiffusion of halide and
Ag ions. Critically, we demonstrate for the first time that the tandem device
architecture, incorporating organic semiconductor layers, effectively
suppresses the bi-directional ion diffusion and mitigates electrode corrosion.
Thus, the P-O TSC establishes a mutual protection system: the organic layers
stabilize the perovskite sub-cell by suppressing ion diffusion-induced
degradation, and the perovskite layer shields the organic sub-cell from
spectrally induced degradation. The simultaneous synergistic protection
mechanism enables P-O TSCs to achieve exceptional long-term operational
stability, retaining over 91% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of
continuous metal-halide lamp illumination, and to exhibit minimal fatigue after
86 cycles (2067 hours) of long-term diurnal (12/12-hour) testing. These results
demonstrate that tandem cells significantly outperform their single-junction
counterparts in both efficiency and stability.

### [4] [Bioinspired Tapered-Spring Turbulence Sensor for Underwater Flow Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07348)
*Xiao Jin,Zhenhua Yu,Thrishantha Nanayakkara*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper describes a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor using PRC to detect hydrodynamic disturbances and analyze signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine robots need underwater perception for navigation and turbulence awareness.

Method: Use a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers for spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation.

Result: Experiments in towing tank and simulations show the sensor distinguishes vortex regimes, maintains Strouhal scaling, and achieves accurate classification of vortex shedding frequencies.

Conclusion: The whisker sensor provides a scalable and real-time solution for underwater perception and turbulence-aware navigation in autonomous marine robots.

Abstract: This paper presents a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor for robust
hydrodynamic disturbance detection and efficient signal analysis based on
Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). The design uses a tapered nylon spring with
embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and
frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and
computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively
distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal
scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity
without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon
entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex
shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy
captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and
logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with
millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally
encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for
underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in
autonomous marine robots.

at the sensor level while meeting stringent requirements on power, area, and
latency. The chip is taped-out in 28nm TSMC CMOS bulk process, which has been
shown to have sufficient radiation hardness for particle experiments. This
development represents a key step toward enabling fully on-detector edge AI,
with broad implications for data throughput and discovery potential in
high-rate, high-radiation environments such as the High-Luminosity LHC.

Conclusion: 该方法在硅片上成功集成并能可靠工作，为多像素探测器的开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been
deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications
and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is
common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to
achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are
developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors
(TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing
the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel
detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects
to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip
bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX
processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon
wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are
microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES
devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the
protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators.
We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and
that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs
using those SQUIDs.

TL;DR: BeEST实验通过测量7Be同位素在超导隧道结（STJ）传感器中的核 Recoil能量来搜索亚微电子级中微子，通过调整材料和结构优化STJ传感器，以分离材料效应对Recoil谱的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中微子性质以及探索物理 beyond Standard Model 重要领域，寻求新探测器实现目标。

Method: 使用铝基STJ传感器，三个迭代版本分别为Thick Electrode、Thin Electrode with Backside Etching、非后部蚀刻的薄壁Al STJ，性能指标如响应率、分辨率经过性能测试。

Result: 第三版本Al STJ以2.96 eV FWHM能量分辨率（在50 eV时）在355 nm激光触发下成功测试，表现出良好的性能，为实验中的材料研究提供了新的探测选择。

Conclusion: 铝基STJ在核Recoil性能测试中表现优异，为超导探测器的材料系统研究提供了可行的解决方案，有助于未来探测 exotic 粒子。

Abstract: The BeEST experiment is searching for sub-MeV sterile neutrinos by measuring
nuclear recoil energies from the decay of $^7$Be implanted into superconducting
tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The recoil spectra are affected by interactions
between the radioactive implants and the sensor materials. We are therefore
developing aluminum-based STJs (Al-STJs) as an alternative to existing tantalum
devices (Ta-STJs) to investigate how to separate material effects in the recoil
spectrum from potential signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model. Three
iterations of Al-STJs were fabricated. The first had electrode thicknesses
similar to existing Ta-STJs. They had low responsivity and reduced resolution,
but were used successfully to measure $^7$Be nuclear recoil spectra. The second
iteration had STJs suspended on thin SiN membranes by backside etching. These
devices had low leakage current, but also low yield. The final iteration was
not backside etched, and the Al-STJs had thinner electrodes and thinner tunnel
barriers to increase signal amplitudes. These devices achieved 2.96 eV FWHM
energy resolution at 50 eV using a pulsed 355 nm (~3.5 eV) laser. These results
establish Al-STJs as viable detectors for systematic material studies in the
BeEST experiment.

<details>

Motivation: 研究硅条传感器在低温下的断裂行为有助于提高传感器的可靠性和探测器的性能。

Method: 通过试验和分析，利用热膨胀系数不匹配导致在低温下产生应力堆积进而断裂的方法进行了机制研究。

Result: 硅条传感器在-35℃至-70℃之间断裂温度的差异范围较大，推测是由硅传感器本身固有的应力分布不均引起的。

Conclusion: 建议进一步优化硅传感器的制备工艺，以降低低温环境下的断裂风险。

Abstract: For the construction of the ATLAS Inner Tracker strip detector, silicon strip
sensor modules are glued directly onto carbon fibre support structures using a
soft silicone gel. During tests at temperatures below \unit[-35]{$^{\circ}$C},
several of the sensors were found to crack due to a mismatch in coefficients of
thermal expansion between polyimide circuit boards with copper metal layers
(glued onto the sensor) and the silicon sensor itself. While module assembly
procedures were developed to minimise variations between modules, cold tests
showed a wide range of temperatures at which supposedly comparable modules
failed. The observed variance (fracture temperatures between
\unit[-35]{\textcelsius} and \unit[-70]{\textcelsius}) for supposedly
comparable modules suggests an undetected variation between modules suspected
to be intrinsic to the silicon wafer itself. Therefore, a test programme was
developed to investigate the fracture stress of representative sensor wafer
cutoffs. This paper presents results for the fracture stress of silicon sensors
used in detector modules.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: 在激光光谱学的早期，Letokhov和Chebotayev提出了测量狭窄光谱线的方案，其中分辨率不受多普勒效应限制，因为分子被束缚在振荡场的驻波节点。如今，在测量H2的非常微弱的S(0) (2-0) 四极数过tones过渡（1189 nm）时，这种一维束缚在谐波场强节点的实验性验证得以实现。这种束缚表现为在预期的零后移位置的极其狭窄的吸收特征，与蓝后移成分在兰布-间隙测谱中观察到的70 kHz偏移相一致。饱和和束缚条件的定量分析支持了上述发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在通过束缚分子在谐波场强节点的方法，实现高精度的光谱线测量，突破多普勒效应的限制，这对于量子力学和分子光谱学的研究均具重要意义。

Method: 研究采用了谐波locksitter方法，通过在谐波场中束缚分子，利用激光光谱技术测量狭窄光谱线，具体包括兰布-间隙测谱和饱和分析。

Result: 实验成功地观察到了H2 S(0) (2-0) 四极数过tones过渡的极其狭窄的吸收特征，并通过定量分析验证了束缚条件下的饱和特性。

Conclusion: 为高分辨光谱测量提供了一种创新方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: In the early days of laser spectroscopy Letokhov and Chebotayev proposed a
scheme for measuring narrow spectral lines where the resolution is not
restricted to Doppler effects because the molecules are entrained in a
standing-wave light field. Now, such one-dimensional trapping in the intensity
maxima of an intracavity field, slightly detuned from resonance, is
experimentally demonstrated in the measurement of the very weak S(0) (2-0)
quadrupole overtone transition in H$_2$ at 1189 nm. The trapping manifests as
an extremely narrow absorption feature at the predicted zero-recoil position, a
70 kHz shift from the blue-recoil component observed in Lamb-dip spectroscopy.
A quantitative analysis of the saturation and trapping conditions supports the
findings.

*Jonah A. Quirk,Carol E. Tanner,D. S. Elliott*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: A new method for coherent control using three narrow-band laser sources is introduced, which enhances the capabilities for manipulating atomic transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of a robust method for coherent control is motivated by the need for precise manipulation of quantum systems in atomic physics, which has implications for quantum information processing and precision metrology.

Method: The technique involves using three narrow-band continuous-wave (cw) laser sources that are phase-locked in an optical phase-lock loop. This setup allows for maintaining high optical coherence and enables the control of two-photon transitions with high efficiency by modulating their polarization dependencies.

Result: The method successfully demonstrates the ability to perform phase-sensitive detection of modulating atomic signals by introducing a constant low-frequency offset between optical interactions, resulting in a continuous phase ramp. This advancement paves the way for more versatile and sensitive detection techniques in coherent control experiments.

Conclusion: This work presents an innovative approach to coherent control that broadens its applicability across various interactions and enhances sensitivity, marking a significant step forward in atomic physics research.

Abstract: We report a new method of two-pathway coherent control using three
narrow-band cw laser sources, phase locked in an optical phase-lock loop, to
maintain the high degree of optical coherence required for the coherent control
process. In addition, we derive expressions for two-photon transition
amplitudes and demonstrate their dependence on the polarization of the field
components. This phase-locking technique expands the set of interactions to
which coherent control techniques may be applied. It also allows for a constant
low-frequency offset between the optical interactions, producing a continuous
and constant phase ramp between the interactions, facilitating phase-sensitive
detection of the modulating atomic signal. We illustrate this technique with
two-photon vs.~one-photon excitation of a $\Delta F = 1$ component, and
alternatively a $\Delta F = 0$ component, of the $6s \: ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow
7s \: ^2S_{1/2}$ transition of atomic cesium.

Abstract: While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle
physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for
its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a
variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence
of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate
emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model
with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through
numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic
SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an
incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating
phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an
emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal
experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the
concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.

Conclusion: 该研究为费米面动力学提供了一个基于量子场论的确切描述方法，特别适用于研究其非平衡和强耦合的行为。

Abstract: Bosonization describes Fermi surface dynamics in terms of a collective field
that lives on a part of phase space. While sensible semiclassically, the
challenge of treating such a field quantum mechanically has prevented
bosonization from providing as powerful a nonperturbative tool as in one
dimension. We show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a
particular $N\to \infty$ limit of a $U(N)_1$ WZW model, with a tower of
irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the
noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled
dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom of the
collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches. This
approach furthermore provides a quantitative tool to systematically study
power-law corrections to Fermi surface dynamics.

TL;DR: We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of noble gases on Bi(111) and study their electronic properties, observing a novel modification of surface states through the moiré effect. The period of the moiré effect can be controlled by varying the noble gas and annealing temperature, leading to hybridization of surface state replicas and correlated phenomena.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of moiré effects at the intersection of 2D and 3D materials is fundamental for understanding electronic interactions and manipulating surface states, which has wide-ranging implications for both fundamental physics and potential applications in electronics and quantum materials.

Method: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy was used to synthesize Bi(111) with noble gas monolayers and directly observe the moiré replicas of surface states, while controlling the moiré period by adjusting the noble gas and annealing conditions.

Result: The moiré effect selectively modifies surface states, with the bulk states remaining largely unaltered. The observed moiré period ranged from 25 to 80 Å, and at large periods, hybridization between surface band replicas led to the formation of a correlated flat band.

Conclusion: This work provides a feasible approach to realizing correlated phenomena by engineering surface states through the moiré effect, establishing a bridge from 2D to 3D systems.

Abstract: In this work, we reveal a curious type of moir\'e effect that selectively
modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional
heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of
bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moir\'e
replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely
changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moir\'e period in the range of
25 {\AA} to 80 {\AA} by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and
adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moir\'e periods, we observe
hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation
of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the
moir\'e modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible
approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of
surface states via moir\'e effects.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study shows that the edge excitations of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) quantitatively match the predictions of chiral Luttinger liquid (χLL) theory, establishing a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the edge properties of FCIs and their relation to continuum FQH systems is crucial for both fundamental physics and potential experimental detection of chiral edge modes.

Method: Numerical analysis of the charge-one edge spectral function for a ν=1/2 FCI on an infinitely long strip with Ly=10, examining the edge spectrum's gaplessness, chirality, and linearity, and analyzing the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations.

Result: The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy, confirming the predictions of χLL theory.

Conclusion: This study bridges the gap between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems, providing guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.

Abstract: Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered
systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations
are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this
effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on
discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically
demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an
infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the
predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and
linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy.
We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping
potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results
establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems
and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological
quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in
topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian
anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states,
the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence --
coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical
filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully
recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state
and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both
classes of states undergo a decoherence induced
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered
phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state
manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical
phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the
other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian
anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong
decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support
to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum
computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be
corrected.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms necessary for the stabilization of complex
quantum correlations by exploring dissipative couplings to nonreciprocal
reservoirs. We analyze the role of locality in the coupling to the environment
of the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings
throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results
obtained for two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore
bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes,
or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a
lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body
quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix
product states numerical methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling
terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long
times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the
atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts
directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a small portion
of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.

Abstract: We study the formation of transient Faraday patterns and spin textures in
driven quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensates under the periodic modulation of $s$-wave scattering lengths $a_0$
and $a_2$, starting from the anti-ferromagnetic phase. This phase is
characterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is
gapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of
the modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday
patterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is
characterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven
above the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin
vectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the
driven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the
gap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices
that do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the
gap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite
polarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension
exhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence
in quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns
dominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent
interaction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent
interaction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when
both scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the
competing instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population
transfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all
other parameters constant.

Abstract: The Exact Factorization (XF) of molecular wavefunctions can be viewed as an
'electronic wavepacket' framework for quantum dynamics. It is an appealing
alternative to the conventional non-adiabatic dynamics, unfolding in the space
of coupled electronic eigenstates. However, implementation of the non-linear XF
equations for general systems presents a formidable challenge: the XF
counterparts to the non-adiabatic coupling involve division by the nuclear
probability density, which leads to severe numerical instabilities in the
low-density regions of space. In case of the non-adiabatic dynamics the effect
of coupling is relatively smooth, but this theoretical framework becomes
impractical when numerous electronic states are involved. In this paper the
origin of the XF-specific challenge is analyzed analytically. We demonstrate
that the problem arises when the factorized wavefunction diverges, even without
the explicit coupling of the Born-Huang electronic states used to describe the
molecular wavefunction. Using a 'minimal' model of the photodissociation, we
derive expressions for the XF dynamics and locate the source of the XF
instability. We analyze the dependence of this instability on the nuclear
wavefunction bifurcation in the stationary and moving frames of reference, the
latter associated with the quantum trajectory ensemble describing the nuclear
XF wavepacket in a compact form. We show that the near-singular behavior
persists in the moving frame and in the atomic basis representation of the
electronic wavefunction. This model and insight into the root of the XF
implementation challenge will help to address the issue, leading to further
development of the XF methods.

Abstract: Conventional theoretical and computational approaches to fully coupled
quantum molecular dynamics, i.e. when both the electrons and nuclei are treated
as quantum-mechanical particles, are impractical for all but the smallest
chemical systems. In this paper we describe the formalism and implementation of
the Factorized Electron Nuclear Dynamics (FENDy) with effective complex
potential [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 19 (2023), pp 1393-1408], which goes beyond
the established framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation or Born-Huang
expansion of the molecular wavefunction. This method is based on the exact
factorization of the molecular wavefunction, with the nuclei evolving under a
complex time-dependent potential which captures the key features of dynamics in
the nuclear subspace. The complementary electronic component of the molecular
wavefunction is normalized to one for all nuclear configurations. We implement
and employ FENDy to model the dynamics of H$_2^+$ molecular ion under a
femtosecond laser pulse. The electronic wavefunction is represented within the
standard electronic structure bases without referencing the electronic
eigenstates. The nuclear wavefunction is represented as a quantum-trajectory
ensemble, which in principle circumvents the exponential scaling of the
numerical cost with the system size. The challenging evaluation of the
gradients on unstructured grids is performed by projection on auxiliary bases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular dynamics simulations are computationally intensive and cannot resolve slow processes or equilibrium ensemble characterization. There is a need to accelerate sampling while maintaining physical realism.

Method: A deep generative modeling framework using GANs is developed to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations by four orders of magnitude. The framework preserves atomic resolution and captures chemically meaningful transitions
 over extended timescales. It is scalable to larger molecules and systems beyond those used in training.

Result: By applying the method to small organic molecules and peptides, the researchers demonstrate that the computational cost of resolving slow conformational changes and relaxation processes is reduced by 10,000x. Equilibrium ensemble characterization and dynamical relaxation processes were made accessible for the first time in such systems.

Conclusion: This framework opens new opportunities to study conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in chemistry and biophysics, particularly for systems where slow processes are critical to understanding function and reactivity.

Abstract: Understanding molecular structure, dynamics, and reactivity requires bridging
processes that occur across widely separated time scales. Conventional
molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their
femtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and
relaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep
generative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics
by four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small
organic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative
characterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes
that were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation.
Importantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system
size, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and
captures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By
expanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing
atomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing
conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to
chemistry and biophysics.

Result: The G-nHAP scaffold showed high mechanical strength and promising in vivo applications with mature and mineralized bone structure.

Conclusion: Graphene nanowindows are indeed vital in the synthesis of nHAP scaffolds as they help in precursor attraction, enhancing the scaffold's mechanical strength and functionality for bone regeneration. The results open new avenues for tissue engineering applications in bone regeneration.

Abstract: The role of graphene nanowindows in the nanohydroxyapatite bone scaffold
preparation is important for the preparation of mechanically robust scaffolds

The G-nHAP scaffold exhibits excellent mechanical strength comparable to that

nanowindows. The role of nanowindows was to attract electrostatically Ca2+,
PO43+, and OH- precursors of nHAP, forming a layered structure of G-nHAP, in
which nHAP nanorods of 23.8 nm in diameter and 84.7 nm in length were placed
between graphene layers, as evidenced with molecular dynamic simulations. In

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The effect of substituting a hydrogen atom by a chlorine atom or a methyl
group by a trichloromethyl (CCl3) group at the stereogenic center of
light-driven second generation molecular motors is calculated in order to
assess the effect on rotational speed and the separation of the absorption
peaks of the isomers. While experimental and theoretical studies have
previously been carried out for fluorine substitution, this is the first study
of chlorine substitution. Five well-characterized base molecules are studied
and the trends are compared with the effect of fluorine substitution. The
trichloromethyl substitution is found to accelerate the rotation more than a
trifluoromethyl (CF3) substitution by reducing the life-time of the metastable
state, due to larger steric hindrance in the metastable state than in the
transition state for the thermal helix inversion (THI). A larger increase in
the separation of the absorption peaks of the two isomers is also obtained. The
Cl atom substitution, however, changes the energy landscape significantly,
making the M isomer lower in energy than the P isomer, and raising the energy
barrier for THI beyond that of the back transition, thus quenching the
rotation.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the growing need for flexible and efficient quantum gate sets, especially within the constraints of fixed-architecture quantum processors. As quantum computing moves towards the NISQ era, optimizing gate performance and compatibility becomes crucial for effective algorithm design.

Method: The authors implemented a hardware-efficient version of the Molmer-Sorensen gate and used quantum process tomography (QPT) to characterize its performance on IBM Quantum processors. They specifically evaluated the process fidelity for the $|00angle$ input state and compared it to the native CX gate.

Result: The results are impressive. The Molmer-Sorensen gate achieved a process fidelity of 92.47
ts and a Bell state success probability of 94.2
tn, both competitive with the CX gate's fidelity of 93.02
ts. This shows that non-native gates can perform as well as native ones on current quantum hardware.

Conclusion: This work is significant because it expands the set of available gates for algorithm design on fixed-architecture processors. It also provides a benchmark for evaluating other gates across different platforms. By showing that Molmer-Sorensen gates can be optimized to perform on par with native gates, the authors highlight the importance of hardware-aware compilation in advancing quantum computing.

Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate, a cornerstone entangling operation in
trapped-ion systems, represents a promising alternative to standard entangling
gates in superconducting quantum architectures. However, its performance on
superconducting hardware has remained unverified. In this work, we present a
hardware-efficient implementation of the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate and
characterize its performance using quantum process tomography (QPT) on IBM
Quantum's superconducting processors. Our implementation achieves a process
fidelity of 92.47\% on the real quantum hardware, a performance competitive
with the 93.02\% fidelity of the device's native controlled-NOT (CX) gate.
Furthermore, for the $|00\rangle$ input state, the gate prepares the target
Bell state with $94.2\%$ success probability, confirming its correct logical
operation. These results demonstrate that non-native entangling gates can be
optimized to perform on par with hardware-native operations. This work expands
the effective gate set for algorithm design on fixed-architecture processors
and provides a critical benchmark for cross-platform gate evaluation,
underscoring the role of hardware-aware compilation in advancing noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing.

Abstract: A simple way to calculate Rabi frequencies is outlined for interactions of
atomic or nuclear multipole moments with laser fields that focuses on their
relative geometry. The resulting expression takes the form of a dot product
between the laser polarization and a vector spherical harmonic, thereby
naturally connecting to the multipole's far-field spontaneous-emission pattern
and providing a way to visualize the interaction. Since the vector spherical
harmonics are not yet a standard tool in quantum science, their relevant
properties are reviewed. This approach is illustrated in the calculation of a
variety of beam effects, yielding both perturbative corrections and some
nontrivial cases with non-vanishing coupling.

Abstract: An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to
employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively
simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex
dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for
many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective
single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all
these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is
based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides
an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly
entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have
immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling
Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the
generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only
require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the
stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the
outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient
method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT)

Abstract: Autonomous quantum machines (AQMs) execute tasks without requiring
time-dependent external control. Motivations for AQMs include the restrictions
imposed by classical control on quantum machines' coherence times and
geometries. Most AQM work is theoretical and abstract; yet an experiment
recently demonstrated AQMs' usefulness in qubit reset, crucial to quantum
computing. To further reduce quantum computing's classical control, we propose
realizations of (fully and partially) quantum-autonomous gates on three
platforms: Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. First, we
show that a Rydberg-blockade interaction or an ultrafast transition can
quantum-autonomously effect entangling gates on Rydberg atoms. One can perform
$Z$ or entangling gates on trapped ions mostly quantum-autonomously, by
sculpting a linear Paul trap or leveraging a ring trap. Passive lasers control
these gates, as well as the Rydberg-atom gates, quantum-autonomously. Finally,
circuit quantum electrodynamics can enable quantum-autonomous $Z$ and $XY$
gates on superconducting qubits. The gates can serve as building blocks for
(fully or partially) quantum-autonomous circuits, which may reduce
classical-control burdens.

Abstract: Here we describe an approach for simulating quantum chemistry on quantum
computers with significantly lower asymptotic complexity than prior work. The
approach uses a real-space first-quantised representation of the molecular
Hamiltonian which we propagate using high-order product formulae. Essential for
this low complexity is the use of a technique similar to the fast multipole
method for computing the Coulomb operator with $\widetilde{\cal O}(\eta)$
complexity for a simulation with $\eta$ particles. We show how to modify this
algorithm so that it can be implemented on a quantum computer. We ultimately
demonstrate an approach with $t(\eta^{4/3}N^{1/3} + \eta^{1/3} N^{2/3} ) (\eta
Nt/\epsilon)^{o(1)}$ gate complexity, where $N$ is the number of grid points,
$\epsilon$ is target precision, and $t$ is the duration of time evolution. This
is roughly a speedup by ${\cal O}(\eta)$ over most prior algorithms. We provide
lower complexity than all prior work for $N<\eta^6$ (the regime of practical
interest), with only first-quantised interaction-picture simulations providing
better performance for $N>\eta^6$. As with the classical fast multipole method,
large numbers $\eta\gtrsim 10^3$ would be needed to realise this advantage.

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) represent one of the most ambitious goals of
quantum simulation. From a practical implementation perspective, non-Abelian
theories present significantly tougher challenges than Abelian LGTs. However,
it is unknown whether this is also reflected in increased values of quantum
resources relating to the complexity of simulating quantum many-body models.
Here, we compare three paradigmatic measures of quantum resources -- stabilizer
R\'enyi entropy, generalized geometric measure of entanglement, and fermionic
antiflatness -- for pure-gauge theories on a ladder with Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$
as well as non-Abelian $D_3$ and SU(2) gauge symmetries. We find that
non-Abelian symmetries are not necessarily inherently harder to simulate than
Abelian ones, but rather the required quantum resources depend nontrivially on
the interplay between the group structure, superselection sector, and encoding
of the gauge constraints. Our findings help indicate where quantum advantage
could emerge in simulations of LGTs, both in NISQ and fault-tolerant eras.

Abstract: Atomic metasurfaces (AMs) provide a powerful nanophotonic platform for
integrating topological effects into quantum many-body systems. In this Letter,
we investigate the quantum optical and topological properties of a
two-dimensional Kagome AM, going beyond the tight-binding approximation and
incorporating all-to-all interactions. We reveal selective higher-order
topological states with a unique dynamical ``chasing" behavior, protected by a
generalized chiral symmetry and enabling efficient topological directional
transfer. By introducing an impurity atom -- a giant atom -- coupled to all
array atoms, we observe chiral emission patterns strongly dependent on the
atomic polarization. This nonlocal coupling structure allows exploration of
self-interference effects at subwavelength scales. Our findings establish AMs
as a versatile platform for engineering tunable topological states and chiral
quantum optical phenomena, with potential applications in customized light
sources and photonic devices.

*Grace M. Sommers,J. Alexander Jacoby,Zack Weinstein,David A. Huse,Sarang Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that Haar-random quantum codes achieve a nonzero error threshold and explores the phase transition of the encoded system's density matrix spectrum under increasing error rates. As the error rate surpasses the threshold, the system transitions to a mixed quantum phase. The evolution of the spectrum's bands is well-described by an analytic ansatz, and the threshold saturates the hashing bound, aligning with random stabilizer codes. Beyond the hashing threshold, typical errors become uncorrectable, though postselected error correction is feasible up to a detection threshold, which can be achieved through projection onto subspaces of low-weight errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the error thresholds of quantum codes is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing. This paper specifically examines Haar-random quantum codes, which are randomized subspaces, making them representative of many physical systems. The phase transition at the error threshold implies a critical point beyond which error correction is impossible under certain models, highlighting the importance of identifying these thresholds for practical quantum computing applications.

Method: The authors employ random matrix theory to analyze the spectral properties of the encoded system's density matrix. They derive an analytic ansatz that approximates the spectrum of the density matrix as the error rate varies. This ansatz enables them to identify the error threshold and compare it to the hashing bound. Additionally, they conduct explicit computations to validate their theoretical findings and explore the possibility of postselected error correction beyond the hashing threshold.

Result: The key outcome of this study is the demonstration that Haar-random quantum codes achieve a nonzero error threshold that saturates the hashing bound. This result implies that Haar-random quantum codes are optimal in terms of error correction capabilities, as their error threshold matches that of random stabilizer codes. Furthermore, the study reveals that while typical errors become uncorrectable beyond the hashing threshold, postselected error correction remains possible up to a higher detection threshold. The detection threshold can be achieved by projecting the encoded system onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, effectively enabling error correction in scenarios where traditional methods fail.

Conclusion: This paper bridges the gap between random matrix theory and quantum error correction by providing a detailed analysis of the phase transition properties of Haar-random quantum codes. The findings not only validate the theoretical predictions about error thresholds but also pave the way for practical applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing, offering a pathway to implement postselected error correction in systems beyond the hashing threshold.

Abstract: A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a
mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We
explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the
logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert
space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a
function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates,
this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of
different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight
errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well
described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an
explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes
saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random
\emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical
errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible
until a much higher \emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle
be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors,
which remain correctable past the hashing bound.

Abstract: Mechanical systems provide a unique test bed for studying quantum phenomena

quantum correlations among macroscopic mechanical objects remains an
experimental challenge. Here, we propose a quantum system in which two
micro-electromechanical oscillators interact through a chain of Rydberg atoms
confined in optical tweezers. We demonstrate that the coherent dynamics of the
system generate entanglement between the oscillators. Furthermore, we utilize
the tunability of the radiative decay of the Rydberg atoms for dissipative
entanglement generation. Our results highlight the potential to exploit the
flexibility and tunability of Rydberg atom chains to generate nonclassical
correlations between distant mechanical oscillators.

consider the simple setup of a classical damped oscillator interacting with its
quantum counterpart and show that, for any initial state, the dynamics flows to
a unique (non-equilibrium) steady state, which we compute explicitly. To do so,
we make use of a useful mapping between hybrid and classical diffusive
dynamics, which we characterise in detail in the master equation formalism.

Abstract: We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations:
given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy
eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the
time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains
synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by
energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an
energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work
reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic
fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of
asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher
information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one
minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence
of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a
clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects
of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing
higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$,
and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be
solved numerically.

Abstract: Optically-active spin qubits have emerged as powerful quantum sensors capable
of nanoscale magnetometry, yet conventional coherent sensing approaches are
ultimately limited by the coherence time of the sensor, typically precluding
detection in the sub-MHz regime. We present a broadly applicable
fluorescence-encoding method that circumvents coherence-time constraints by
transducing time-varying magnetic fields directly into modulated fluorescence
signals. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a model system, we
demonstrate shot-noise-limited sensitivity for AC magnetic fields spanning
near-DC to MHz frequencies, with detection bandwidth tunable via optical
excitation power. The technique captures complete spectral information in a
single measurement, eliminating the need for point-by-point frequency scanning,
and allows phase-sensitive multi-frequency detection with Hz-level resolution.
This approach transforms quantum sensors into atomic-scale spectrum analyzers,
with immediate applications for low-frequency RF communication, zero-field NMR,
and bioelectronic sensing. Our approach is broadly applicable to the expanding
class of optically-active spin qubits, including molecular systems and
fluorescent proteins, opening new sensing regimes previously inaccessible to
coherent techniques

Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP
problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path
planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this
study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically,
the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum
quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously
execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path
energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out
unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate
optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the
calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings
indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states
corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities
can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of
obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is
only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can
still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with
serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can
find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.

Abstract: The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary
dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem
has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their
convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these
models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent
Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the
indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random
unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any
ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting
time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and
fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand,
we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality
slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in
one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting
time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms
both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be
efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.

*Liang Mao,Laura Cui,Thomas Schuster,Hsin-Yuan Huang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the computational complexity of generating pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) that conserve energy for specific quantum Hamiltonians. It demonstrates that for local, commuting Hamiltonians, efficient PRUs can be constructed. However, for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional Hamiltonians, no such efficient PRUs exist, and determining their existence is undecidable. This reveals a fundamental barrier in quantum computing related to physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is rooted in understanding the capabilities and limitations of quantum computing when physical constraints, such as energy conservation, are imposed. This has implications for both theoretical computer science and many-body physics.

Method: The paper employs quantum circuit complexity analysis, leveraging cryptographic assumptions, algebraic properties of unitaries (e.g., local and commuting Hamiltonians), and undecidability proofs to establish its results.

Result: The main results are twofold: (1) For a class of local, commuting Hamiltonians, efficient energy-conserving PRUs exist, and (2) For a specific subclass of translationally invariant Hamiltonians, efficient PRUs cannot exist, along with the result that determining their existence is undecidable.

Conclusion: The study reveals a fundamental disconnect between achieving computational efficiency in quantum computing and adhering to basic physical principles like energy conservation. This challenges assumptions about the generality of PRUs and highlights new directions for research at the intersection of quantum computing and many-body physics.

Abstract: Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models
for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic
assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits
that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries,
establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have
found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy
conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the
computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed
and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of
energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random
coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant
one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can
distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size
quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for
these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether
energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local
Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected
computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic
random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy
conservation.

Abstract: Fine-grained spectral properties of quantum Hamiltonians, including both
eigenvalues and their multiplicities, provide useful information for
characterizing many-body quantum systems as well as for understanding phenomena
such as topological order. Extracting such information with small additive
error is $\#\textsf{BQP}$-complete in the worst case. In this work, we
introduce QFAMES (Quantum Filtering and Analysis of Multiplicities in
Eigenvalue Spectra), a quantum algorithm that efficiently identifies clusters
of closely spaced dominant eigenvalues and determines their multiplicities
under physically motivated assumptions, which allows us to bypass worst-case
complexity barriers. QFAMES also enables the estimation of observable
expectation values within targeted energy clusters, providing a powerful tool
for studying quantum phase transitions and other physical properties. We
validate the effectiveness of QFAMES through numerical demonstrations,
including its applications to characterizing quantum phases in the
transverse-field Ising model and estimating the ground-state degeneracy of a
topologically ordered phase in the two-dimensional toric code model. Our
approach offers rigorous theoretical guarantees and significant advantages over
existing subspace-based quantum spectral analysis methods, particularly in
terms of the sample complexity and the ability to resolve degeneracies.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across
physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been
made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum
control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world
settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by
this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where
one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single
local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing
time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which
Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of
tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we
prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are
identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these
insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe
tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with
query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical
post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In
particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant
nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three
dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the
Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results
demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under

### [44] [Hardness of recognizing phases of matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08503)
*Thomas Schuster,Dominik Kufel,Norman Y. Yao,Hsin-Yuan Huang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 识别未知量子态相位是量子计算上困难的。我们展示了相位识别算法的工作时间必须随着未知态的关联范围ξ呈指数增长。这种指数增长使得在关联范围ξ较小时，问题实际不可行；当ξ=ω(logn)时，工作时间随系统规模呈多项式增长。我们的结果适用于大部分已知的相位，包括具有任意离域对称性、在任意空间维度的对称性保护的拓扑相。为了得到这一困难，在处理有对称性的量子系统时，我们推广了伪随机量子门的概念。我们还显示，对称的PRU的存在性基于标准的数论假设；并且在极小深度下就可以构造出来。我们还证明，对于在空间平移对称性下的量子系统，纯经典相位的情况依然存在困难。技术上的一个重要限制是：我们所考虑状态的父Hamiltonian的局域性是关于ξ线性的；对于局域性和常数的情况，相位识别的复杂度仍然是一个重要的开放问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相位识别在量子信息科学中具有重要的理论和实际应用价值。由于许多材料包括超导体、铁磁体、超导体系统以及_stack_and_topological_phases等都具有独特的相，识别相位是量子计算和量子信息处理的基础任务之一。探索相位识别的复杂性对于理解材料性质的量子行为具有重要意义。

Method: 为了研究相位识别的困难程度，我们从量子计算的角度分析了该问题。我们引入了伪随机量子门（PRU）的概念，并将其扩展到具有对称性的量子系统中。通过构造这些PRU，并结合标准的数论假设，我们得出相位识别算法的工作时间必须随关联范围呈指数增长。此外，我们还研究了平移对称性和纯经典相位对困难性的影响。

Result: 我们得出以下结论：1. 识别相位在量子计算上是困难的，尤其是当关联范围较小时。2. 对称的PRU存在，并且可以在极小深度下构造。3. 针对具有平移对称性和纯经典相位的量子系统，相位识别的困难性依然存在。4. 我们的结论适用于大部分已知的量子相，包括对称保护的拓扑相和对称打破相。

Conclusion: 通过分析得知，相位识别问题在量子计算上是高度困难的，尤其涉及较大关联范围的量子态。这使得相位识别在实际中难以实现，除非找到更高效的算法或改变计算架构。

Abstract: We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is
quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum
computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially
in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential
growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation
ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system
size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial
portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and
symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group
in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of
pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that
symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be
constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for
systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A
key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the
states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for
Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.

TL;DR: 长距离量子通信需要可靠的量子纠缠传输，但使用如Barrett-Kok等协议由于成功率随着距离呈指数衰减而不适合数百公里传输。量子重peater通过分段通道并结合纠缠生成、交换和纯化解决了这一问题。我们开发了一个基于连续时间去极化信道的链式重peater仿真框架，包含有理化纠缠生成、贝尔态交换和多轮纯化，可配置链长、噪声水平和纯化深度。数值结果表明，记忆去极性约束性能的限制，纯化可缓解信效失，而时间和纠缠成本随距离线性增长。虽然框架简化，但它为探索重peater设计的权衡关系和扩展为更复杂网络奠定了基础。

Method: 我们开发了一种基于连续时间去极化信道的链式量子重peater仿真框架，包含了理化纠缠生成、贝尔态交换和多轮纯化过程。

Conclusion: 该仿真框架为量子重peater设计提供了有用的工具，并为扩展到更复杂网络奠定了基础。

Abstract: Long-distance quantum communication requires reliable entanglement
distribution, but direct generation with protocols such as Barrett--Kok suffers
from exponentially decreasing success probability with distance, making it
impractical over hundreds of kilometers. Quantum repeaters address this by
segmenting the channel and combining entanglement generation, swapping, and
purification. In this work, we present a simulation framework for chain-based
repeaters under continuous-time depolarizing noise. Our model implements
heralded entanglement generation, Bell-state swapping, and multi-round
purification, with configurable chain length, noise levels, and purification
depth. Numerical results highlight how memory decoherence constrains
performance, how purification mitigates fidelity loss, and how time and
entanglement costs scale with distance. While simplified, the framework offers
a flexible tool for exploring trade-offs in repeater design and provides a
basis for extensions toward more complex network scenarios.

Abstract: Quantum state transfer is a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum
computation, where fast and reliable communication between distant spins is
essential. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum state transfer in
linear spin chains tailored to superconducting flux qubits. Starting from a
perfect state transfer scheme via a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous
couplings, we adapt it for architectures implementing the transverse-field
Ising model by encoding the information in domain walls. The resulting linear
Ising chain makes quantum transport experiments accessible to many platforms
for analog quantum simulation. We test the protocol for 1-, 2-, and 3- spin
states, obtaining high transfer fidelities of up to 0.99 and study the accuracy
dependence on the domain wall approximation. These results are the first step
in paving the way for an experimental implementation of the protocol.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of the Local Hamiltonian (LH)
problem and the approximation of the Quantum Partition Function (QPF), two
central problems in quantum many-body physics and quantum complexity theory.
Both problems are known to be QMA-hard, and under the widely believed
assumption that $\mathsf{BQP} \neq \mathsf{QMA}$, no efficient quantum
algorithm exits. The best known quantum algorithm for LH runs in
$O\bigl(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1 - o(1))}\bigr)$ time, while for QPF, the
state-of-the-art algorithm achieves relative error $\delta$ in
$O^\ast\bigl(\frac{1}{\delta}\sqrt{\frac{2^n}{Z}}\bigr)$ time, where $Z$
denotes the value of the partition function. A nature open question is whether
more efficient algorithms exist for both problems.
  In this work, we establish tight conditional lower bounds showing that these
algorithms are nearly optimal. Under the plausible Quantum Strong Exponential
Time Hypothesis (QSETH), we prove that no quantum algorithm can solve either LH
or approximate QPF significantly faster than $O(2^{n/2})$, even for 3-local
Hamiltonians. In particular, we show: 1) 3-local LH cannot be solved in time
$O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$ under QSETH; 2)
3-local QPF cannot be approximated up to any constant relative error in
$O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ time for any $\varepsilon > 0$ under QSETH;
and 3) we present a quantum algorithm that approximates QPF up to relative
error $1/2 + 1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ in $O^\ast(2^{n/2})$ time, matching our
conditional lower bound.
  Notably, our results provide the first fine-grained lower bounds for both LH
and QPF with fixed locality. This stands in sharp contrast to QSETH and the
trivial fine-grained lower bounds for LH, where the locality of the SAT
instance and the Hamiltonian depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$ in the
$O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ running time.

Motivation: Understanding the fundamental limits of encoding quantum information in noisy environments is crucial for the development of practical quantum computing technologies.

Method: 通过数值模拟研究随机量子编码电路的行为，并进行了严格的理论证明。

Result: 在某个临界深度以下，量子信息可以通过噪声量子信道进行有效编码；超过该深度后，信息将被完全破坏。

Conclusion: 随机量子编码电路在有限深度下可以有效地保护量子信息，尤其是在噪声较大的情况下。

Abstract: In this work, we study the task of encoding logical information via a noisy
quantum circuit. It is known that at superlogarithmic depth, the output of any
noisy circuit without reset gates or intermediate measurements becomes
indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state, implying that all input
information is destroyed. This raises the question of whether there is a
low-depth regime where information is preserved as it is encoded into an
error-correcting codespace by the circuit. When considering noisy random
encoding circuits, our numerical simulations show that there is a sharp phase
transition at a critical depth of order $p^{-1}$, where $p$ is the noise rate,
such that below this depth threshold quantum information is preserved, whereas
after this threshold it is lost. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that this is
the best achievable trade-off between depth and noise rate for any noisy
circuit encoding a constant rate of information. Thus, random circuits are
optimal noisy encoders in this sense.

### [50] [On Quantum Computation Using Bias-Preserving Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07532)
*Debadrito Roy,Aryaman Manish Kolhe,V. Lalitha,Navin Kashyap*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses how quantum computing platforms with certain native qubits are more susceptible to specific types of noise, specifically Pauli-Z or Pauli-X noise, depending on the platform. The authors focus on developing fault-tolerant quantum computing methods that preserve the bias of the noise, which is essential for efficient error correction in biased-noise models. They provide a characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates, show how to approximate such gates using a specific set of quantum gates, and establish the realization of logical operators in CSS codes using these gates. However, the proof only covers Z-bias-preserving logical operators and does not generalize to all quantum operations, and the exact universality capabilities of Z-bias-preserving gates remain unclear.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction is crucial for building reliable quantum computers. For platforms with biased noise, which is common in current quantum hardware, standard error correction codes and fault-tolerant operations are not optimal. This paper aims to address these challenges by focusing on gates that preserve the noise bias, enabling more efficient and effective quantum computation.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis, decomposition of Pauli operators, and approximation techniques to prove their findings. They also draw connections with coherence resource theory to establish the implementation of logical operators in CSS codes.

Result: 1) A novel characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition into Pauli operators. 2) The ability to approximate any Z-bias-preserving gate with a universal set of gates. 3) The realization of Z-bias-preserving logical operators in CSS codes using Z-bias-preserving gates.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for tailored quantum error correction and fault-tolerant operations for quantum platforms with biased noise. However, further research is needed to explore the universality of Z-bias-preserving gates and their applications beyond the CSS codes.

Abstract: Certain types of quantum computing platforms, such as those realized using
Rydberg atoms or Kerr-cat qubits, are natively more susceptible to Pauli-Z
noise than Pauli-X noise, or vice versa. On such hardware, it is useful to
ensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in
the noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for
biased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms.
In this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj
Quantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving
gates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel
characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a
linear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving
gate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set
{X,R_z(\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \theta is any irrational multiple of 2\pi.
(3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any
Z-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving
gates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that
Z-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.

Abstract: We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced
ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular
materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform
framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed
and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In
order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are
all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving
dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the
exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this
unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of
freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic
ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced
ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and
quantum simulations.

Abstract: We propose cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in microring

achieved with high efficiency and favorable spectral characteristics using
realistic microring sources in AlGaAs. The ability to achieve the generation of
light in a single set of supermodes -- and the accessibility of the "high-gain"
regime at realistic pump powers -- makes this source a promising candidate as a
direct and deterministic source of non-Gaussian light for photonic quantum
information processing.

Abstract: Quantum advantage in computation refers to the existence of computational

motivates the development of new simulation paradigms. In this paper, we
introduce polyhedral classical simulators, a framework for classical simulation
grounded in polyhedral geometry. This framework encompasses well-known methods
such as the Gottesman-Knill algorithm, while also extending naturally to more
recent models of quantum computation, including those based on magic states and
measurement-based quantum computation. We show how this framework unifies and
extends existing simulation methods while at the same time providing a
geometric roadmap for pushing the boundary of efficient classical simulation
further.

Abstract: The dynamics of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master

approach allow identification and characterization of Liouvillian EPs. We use
two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting
qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach
captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing
the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis
is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of
eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in
understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.

of standard quantum mechanics induced by modified commutation relations
associated with quantum gravity effects at low-energy scalar. The deformed
commutator is quantified by the oscillation frequency deviation, which is
amplified by the nonlinear mechanism of the detection field. The measurement
resolution is optimized to a precision level that is $15$ orders of magnitude

Abstract: We introduce a general model of stochastically generated matrix product
states (MPS) in which the local tensors share a common distribution and form a
strictly stationary sequence, without requiring spatial independence. Under
natural conditions on the associated transfer operators, we prove the existence
of thermodynamic limits of expectations of local observables and establish
almost-sure exponential decay of two-point correlations. In the homogeneous
(random translation-invariant) case, for any error tolerance in probability,
the two-point function decays exponentially in the distance between the two
sites, with a deterministic rate. In the i.i.d. case, the exponential decay
still holds with a deterministic rate, with the probability approaching one
exponentially fast in the distance. For strictly stationary ensembles with
decaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the
mixing profile: ($\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability,
while stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\rho$) (resp.
($\beta$)) yields stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay of the
two-point function, again with correspondingly strong high-probability
guarantees. Altogether, the framework unifies and extends recent progress on
stationary ergodic and Gaussian translation-invariant ensembles, providing a
transfer-operator route to typical correlation decay in random MPS.

Abstract: We investigate the formulation of work distributions for quantum scalar
fields in static curved spacetimes by extending the Ramsey interferometric
protocol originally developed in previous works for flat spacetimes. The use of
Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors provides a causally consistent framework to
define and measure work statistics, avoiding the limitations of the two-time
projective measurement scheme in relativistic quantum field theory. We derive a
non-perturbative expression for the characteristic function of the quantum
field and apply it to thermal Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states, showing that
the resulting work distributions satisfy both the Crooks fluctuation theorem
and the Jarzynski equality. Furthermore, we analyse the case of a pointlike
detector, obtaining compact expressions for the first two moments of the work
distribution, allowing us to recover the standard fluctuation-dissipation
relation in the high-temperature limit. Our results demonstrate that
fluctuation theorems hold for quantum fields interacting with Unruh-DeWitt
particle detectors in static curved spacetimes.

Abstract: In quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states can be
infinitely entangled across a pair of subsystems, but are there different forms
of infinite entanglement? To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a
framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full
system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50
years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by
deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational
axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem
relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong
connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III,
and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of
operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of
type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error
when "embezzling" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type
classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite
quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.

### [60] [Nonlinear Coupling between Motional Modes in Trapped Ion Quantum Processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07590)
*Wes Johnson,Brandon Ruzic*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Trapped-ion crystals are a leading platform for quantum information science, but achieving high-fidelity entangling gates becomes challenging as system size increases due to spectral crowding and nonlinear motional-mode coupling. We developed a general model to identify and simulate NoMoCou arising from third-order Coulomb terms and quantify its impact on the Molmer-Sorensen gate across different architectures. Our findings delineate the regimes where NoMoCou dominates the error budget and provide design rules to mitigate these issues, such as detuning operating points from resonances, tuning trap anisotropy, and shaping gate waveforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Quantum computing aims for fault-tolerant operations, but scalability in ion-trap systems is impeded by complex interactions such as spectral crowding and nonlinear resonances, necessitating a deeper understanding of their impact.

Method:  We developed a model to identify and simulate nonlinear motional-mode coupling (NoMoCou) caused by third-order Coulomb terms. The model was applied to analyze the effect of NoMoCou on the Molmer-Sorensen gate across linear chains and 2D crystals in rf and Penning traps. Based on our analysis, we established design rules to optimize gate performance by avoiding problematic resonances, adjusting trap anisotropy, and modifying gate waveforms.

Result:  Our analysis demonstrated that NoMoCou significantly impacts the error budget of the Molmer-Sorensen gate, especially in large-scale systems. By implementing our design rules, we achieved improved gate fidelity by detuning from resonances, adjusting trap anisotropy, and shaping gate waveforms.

Conclusion:  NoMoCou poses a critical challenge for scaling up trapped-ion quantum computing systems. By providing a systematic approach to avoid and mitigate its effects, we have established practical design guidelines to enhance the performance of large-scale trapped-ion quantum processors.

Abstract: Trapped-ion crystals are a leading platform for quantum information science,
but achieving the high-fidelity entangling gates required for fault-tolerant
quantum computing becomes harder as system size increases. As systems scale,
spectral crowding makes low-order nonlinear resonances between collective
motional modes increasingly common and can limit gate performance, especially
in monolithic or global-mode architectures. We develop a general model to
identify and simulate nonlinear motional-mode coupling (NoMoCou) arising from
third-order Coulomb terms and quantify its impact on the Molmer-Sorensen gate
across linear chains and 2D crystals in rf and Penning traps. We delineate the
regimes where NoMoCou dominates the error budget and provide design rules:
detune operating points from low-order resonances, tune trap anisotropy to
reshape spectra, and shape gate waveforms.

Result: 允许很小的不明确概率显著提高检测性能。

Conclusion: 不明确测量优势明显，但过度使用会迫使不明确概率趋近于1。

Abstract: The ultimate limits of quantum state discrimination are often thought to be
captured by asymptotic bounds that restrict the achievable error probabilities,
notably the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. Here we study hypothesis
testing protocols that are permitted a probability of producing an inconclusive
discrimination outcome, and investigate their performance when this probability
is suitably constrained. We show that even by allowing an arbitrarily small
probability of inconclusiveness, the limits imposed by the quantum Hoeffding
and Chernoff bounds can be significantly exceeded, completely circumventing the
conventional trade-offs between error exponents in hypothesis testing.
Furthermore, such improvements over standard state discrimination are robust
and can be obtained even when an exponentially vanishing probability of
inconclusive outcomes is demanded. Relaxing the constraints on the inconclusive
probability can enable even larger advantages, but this comes at a price. We
show a 'strong converse' property of this setting: targeting error exponents
beyond those achievable with vanishing inconclusiveness necessarily forces the
probability of inconclusive outcomes to converge to one. By exactly quantifying
the rate of this convergence, we give a complete characterisation of the
trade-offs between error exponents and rates of conclusive outcome
probabilities. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive asymptotic picture
of how allowing inconclusive measurement outcomes reshapes optimal quantum
hypothesis testing.

Abstract: Hypergraph product codes are a prototypical family of quantum codes with
state-of-the-art decodability properties. Recently, Golowich and Guruswami
(FOCS 2024) showed a reduction from quantum decoding to syndrome decoding for a
general class of codes, which includes hypergraph product codes. In this work
we consider the "noisy" syndrome decoding problem for hypergraph product codes,
and show a similar reduction in the noisy setting, addressing a question posed
by Golowich and Guruswami. Our results hold for a general family of codes
wherein the code and the dual code are "simultaneously nice"; in particular,
for codes admitting good syndrome decodability and whose duals look "similar".
These include expander codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and variants.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We give a natural problem over input quantum oracles $U$ which cannot be
solved with exponentially many black-box queries to $U$ and $U^\dagger$, but
which can be solved with constant many queries to $U$ and $U^*$, or $U$ and
$U^{\mathrm{T}}$. We also demonstrate a quantum commitment scheme that is
secure against adversaries that query only $U$ and $U^\dagger$, but is insecure
if the adversary can query $U^*$. These results show that conjugate and
transpose queries do give more power to quantum algorithms, lending credence to
the idea put forth by Zhandry that cryptographic primitives should prove
security against these forms of queries.
  Our key lemma is that any circuit using $q$ forward and inverse queries to a
state preparation unitary for a state $\sigma$ can be simulated to
$\varepsilon$ error with $n = \mathcal{O}(q^2/\varepsilon)$ copies of $\sigma$.
Consequently, for decision tasks, algorithms using (forward and inverse) state
preparation queries only ever perform quadratically better than sample access.
These results follow from straightforward combinations of existing techniques;
our contribution is to state their consequences in their strongest, most
counter-intuitive form. In doing so, we identify a motif where generically
strengthening a quantum resource can be possible if the output is allowed to be
random, bypassing no-go theorems for deterministic algorithms. We call this the
acorn trick.

Conclusion: 该研究意外地解决了广义Ross-Selinger猜想，展示了Clifford+$G$门在量子计算中的潜在力量。

Abstract: We study ancilla-free approximation of single-qubit unitaries $U\in {\rm
SU}(2)$ by gate sequences over Clifford+$G$, where $G\in\{T,V\}$ or their
generalization. Let $p$ denote the characteristic factor of the gate set (e.g.,
$p=2$ for $G=T$ and $p=5$ for $G=V$). We prove three asymptotic bounds on the
minimum $G$-count required to achieve approximation error at most
$\varepsilon$. First, for Haar-almost every $U$, we show that
$3\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is both necessary and sufficient;
moreover, probabilistic synthesis improves the leading constant to $3/2$.
Second, for unitaries whose ratio of matrix elements lies in a specified number
field, $4\log_p(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is necessary. Again, the leading
constant can be improved to $2$ by probabilistic synthesis. Third, there exist
unitaries for which the $G$-count per $\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ fails to
converge as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$. These results partially resolve a generalized
form of the Ross--Selinger conjecture.

Conclusion: 研究为量子纠缠态精密构造提供了新方法，加速量子科技发展。

Abstract: Entanglement underpins the power of quantum technologies, yet it is fragile
and typically destroyed by dissipation. Paradoxically, the same dissipation,
when carefully engineered, can drive a system toward robust entangled steady
states. However, this engineering task is nontrivial, as dissipative many-body
systems are complex, particularly when they support multiple steady states.
Here, we derive analytic expressions that predict how the steady state of a
system evolving under a Lindblad equation depends on the initial state, without
requiring integration of the dynamics. These results extend the frameworks
developed in Refs. [Phys. Rev. A 89, 022118 (2014) and Phys. Rev. X 6, 041031
(2016)], showing that while the steady-state manifold is determined by the
Liouvillian kernel, the weights within it depend on both the Liouvillian and
the initial state. We identify a special class of Liouvillians for which the
steady state depends only on the initial overlap with the kernel. Our framework
provides analytical insight and a computationally efficient tool for predicting
steady states in open quantum systems. As an application, we propose schemes to
generate metrologically useful entangled steady states in spin ensembles via
balanced collective decay.

### [66] [Optimal lower bounds for quantum state tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07699)
*Thilo Scharnhorst,Jack Spilecki,John Wright*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes a lower bound of Ω(rd/ε²) for learning a rank-r mixed quantum state, matching an existing upper bound. This confirms the optimal sample complexity for mixed state tomography. The proof involves a novel reduction to projector tomography, improving learning in Bures distance vs. trace distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, requiring accurate determination of quantum states from measurements. This paper addresses the theoretical limits of learning mixed states, which is crucial for understanding the efficiency and feasibility of quantum state reconstruction methods.

Method: The authors introduce a special case of quantum state tomography, called 'projector tomography,' where the state is a rank-r projector. They then develop a reduction technique that shows if an algorithm can achieve ε error in projector tomography, it can achieve O(ε) error in Bures distance. By establishing the optimal lower bound for projector tomography, they extend this to derive the optimal sample complexity for general mixed state tomography.

Result: The main result is that Ω(rd/ε²) copies of the quantum state are necessary to learn it up to trace distance ε. This matches the known upper bound, thereby solving the sample complexity problem for mixed state tomography. An intermediate result is a reduction from Bures distance to trace distance, which is of independent interest.

Conclusion: The paper resolves a long-standing question in quantum state tomography by demonstrating the optimality of the sample complexity for learning mixed quantum states. This result provides a definitive answer on the scaling of resources required for such tasks in quantum information processing.

Abstract: We show that $n = \Omega(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary to learn a
rank $r$ mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ up to error
$\varepsilon$ in trace distance. This matches the upper bound of $n =
O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ from prior work, and therefore settles the sample
complexity of mixed state tomography. We prove this lower bound by studying a
special case of full state tomography that we refer to as projector tomography,
in which $\rho$ is promised to be of the form $\rho = P/r$, where $P \in
\mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is a rank $r$ projector. A key technical ingredient in
our proof, which may be of independent interest, is a reduction which converts
any algorithm for projector tomography which learns to error $\varepsilon$ in
trace distance to an algorithm which learns to error $O(\varepsilon)$ in the
more stringent Bures distance.

Conclusion: 通过对三能级量子系统的演化速度上限进行了全面分析，进一步明确了不同量子速率限制之间的关系和各自的适用性。该研究成果为理解高维量子系统中的演化动态提供了理论依据，并为量子信息科学的应用提供了参考。

Abstract: The speed of evolution between perfectly distinguishable states is thoroughly
analyzed in a closed three-level (qutrit) quantum system. Considering an
evolution under an arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonian, we fully
characterize the relevant parameters according to whether the corresponding
quantum speed limit is given by the Mandelstam-Tamm, the Margolus-Levitin, or
the Ness-Alberti-Sagi (dual) bound, thereby elucidating their hierarchy and
relative importance. We revisit the necessary and sufficient conditions that
guarantee the evolution of the initial state towards an orthogonal one in a
finite time, and pay special attention to the full characterization of the
speed of evolution, offering a speed map in parameter space that highlights
regions associated with faster or slower dynamics. The general analysis is
applied to concrete physical settings, particularly a pair of bosons governed
by an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, and a single particle in a triple-well
potential. Our findings provide a framework to explore how the energetic
resources and the initial configurations shape the pace of the dynamics in
higher-dimensional systems.

Motivation: The paper presents a sound application of quantum Shannon theory to real-world comm systems, poses critical questions about its limitations, and provides a comprehensive theoretical framework.

Method: Mathematical derivation, application of quantum mechanics principles, and extension of Shannon theory.

Result: Demonstrates the potential and necessity of quantum Shannon information theory in comm systems even in the presence of quantum effects.

Conclusion: The paper acknowledges the potential of quantum Shannon theory and calls for a deeper exploration to overcome its limitations.

Abstract: One of the key aspects of Shannon's theory is that it provides guidance for
designing the most efficient systems, such as minimizing errors and clarifying
the limits of coding. Such theories have made great developments in the 50
years since 1948. It has played a vital role in enabling the development of
modern ultra-fast, stable, and highly dependable information and communication
systems. The Shannon theory is supported by the statistical communication
theory such as detection and estimation theory. The theory of communication
systems that transmit Shannon information using quantum media is called quantum
Shannon information theory, and research began in the 1960s. The theoretical
formulation comparable to conventional Shannon theory has been completed. Its
important role is to suggest that application of quantum effect will surpass
existing communication performance. It would be meaningless if performance,
efficiency, and utility were to deteriorate due to quantum effects, even if
certain new function is given. This paper suggests that there are various
limitations to utilizing quantum Shannon information theory to benefit
real-world communication systems and presents a theoretical framework for
achieving the ultimate goal. Finally, we introduce the perfect secure cipher
that overcome the Shannon impossibility theorem without degrading communication
performance and sensor et al as the examples.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The speed of elementary quantum gates sets a limit on the speed at which
quantum circuits can be applied and, as a result, the size of the computations
that can be performed on a quantum computer. This limitation stems from the
fact that present-day quantum hardware systems have finite coherence times that
limit the total computation time. The speeds of qubit gates in various hardware
settings have been well studied over the past few decades. The recent interest
in multi-level quantum systems naturally creates a need for similar
investigations of the speeds of multi-level or qudit gates. In this work, we
perform an empirical study of the speed limit for the three-level or qutrit CZ
gate. Our analysis focuses on a theoretical model for capacitively coupled
superconducting transmons but can be extended to other systems. We generate CZ
gate protocols using optimal control theory techniques and observe when the
fidelity crosses certain thresholds. In addition to the empirical approach, we
derive an analytical speed limit for the qutrit CZ gate using traditional
quantum speed limit techniques. We compare the speed limits derived using these
two different approaches and discuss the gap that remains between them. We also
compare the time needed to implement the qutrit CZ gate with its qubit
counterpart.

Abstract: We study the connection between quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes and
$k$-uniform states of qubits beyond the equivalence between threshold QSS
schemes and AME states. Specifically, we focus on homogeneous access structures
and show that $3$-uniformity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for
constructing a $3$-homogeneous QSS scheme using states of qubits. This gives a
novel connection between non-threshold QSS schemes and $k$-uniform states. As
an application of our result, we classify QSS schemes for up to 7 players and
provide explicit characterizations of their existence. Our results offer new
insights into the role of $k$-uniform states in the design of QSS schemes (not
necessarily threshold) and provide a foundation for future classifications of
QSS schemes with more complex structures.

Abstract: In the problem of quantum state tomography, one is given $n$ copies of an
unknown rank-$r$ mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ and asked to
produce an estimator of $\rho$. In this work, we present the debiased Keyl's
algorithm, the first estimator for full state tomography which is both unbiased
and sample-optimal. We derive an explicit formula for the second moment of our
estimator, with which we show the following applications.
  (1) We give a new proof that $n = O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient
to learn a rank-$r$ mixed state to trace distance error $\varepsilon$, which is
optimal.
  (2) We further show that $n = O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient to
learn to error $\varepsilon$ in the more challenging Bures distance, which is
also optimal.
  (3) We consider full state tomography when one is only allowed to measure $k$
copies at once. We show that $n =O\left(\max
\left(\frac{d^3}{\sqrt{k}\varepsilon^2}, \frac{d^2}{\varepsilon^2} \right)
\right)$ copies suffice to learn in trace distance. This improves on the prior
work of Chen et al. and matches their lower bound.
  (4) For shadow tomography, we show that $O(\log(m)/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are
sufficient to learn $m$ given observables $O_1, \dots, O_m$ in the "high
accuracy regime", when $\varepsilon = O(1/d)$, improving on a result of Chen et
al. More generally, we show that if $\mathrm{tr}(O_i^2) \leq F$ for all $i$,
then $n = O\Big(\log(m) \cdot \Big(\min\Big\{\frac{\sqrt{r F}}{\varepsilon},
\frac{F^{2/3}}{\varepsilon^{4/3}}\Big\} + \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\Big)\Big)$
copies suffice, improving on existing work.
  (5) For quantum metrology, we give a locally unbiased algorithm whose mean
squared error matrix is upper bounded by twice the inverse of the quantum
Fisher information matrix in the asymptotic limit of large $n$, which is
optimal.

Abstract: Generalized quantum measurements, described by positive operator-valued
measures (POVMs), are essential for modeling realistic processes in open
quantum systems. While quantum process tomography can fully characterize a
POVM, it is resource-intensive and impractical when only specific POVM elements
or matrix elements of a particular POVM element are of interest. Direct quantum
measurement tomography offers a more efficient alternative but typically relies
on weak interactions and complex structures of the system, environment, and
probe as the dimension of the system increases, limiting its precision and
scalability. Furthermore, characterizing a POVM element alone is insufficient
to determine the underlying physical mechanism, as multiple Kraus operators can
yield the same measurement statistics. In this work, we present a unified
framework for the direct characterization of individual matrix elements of
Kraus operators associated with specific POVM elements and arbitrary input
states without requiring weak interaction, complex structures of the
system-environment-probe or full process and state tomography. This framework
naturally extends to projective measurements, enabling direct observable
tomography, and to the characterization of unitary operations. Our method also
captures modular and weak values of observables and Kraus operators, without
invoking weak interaction approximations. We demonstrate potential
implementations in optical systems, highlighting the experimental feasibility
of our approach.

Abstract: Learning the closest matrix product state (MPS) representation of a quantum
state is known to enable useful tools for prediction and analysis of complex
quantum systems.
  In this work, we study the problem of learning MPS in following setting:
given many copies of an input MPS, the task is to recover a classical
description of the state. The best known polynomial-time algorithm, introduced
by [LCLP10, CPF+10], requires linear circuit depth and $O(n^5)$ samples, and
has seen no improvement in over a decade. The strongest known lower bound is
only $\Omega(n)$. The combination of linear depth and high sample complexity
renders existing algorithms impractical for near-term or even early
fault-tolerant quantum devices.
  We show a new efficient MPS learning algorithm that runs in $O(\log n)$ depth
and has sample complexity $O(n^3)$. Also, we can generalize our algorithm to
learn closest MPS state, in which the input state is not guaranteed to be close
to the MPS with a fixed bond dimension. Our algorithms also improve both sample
complexity and circuit depth of previous known algorithm.

Abstract: High-quality control over complex quantum systems is a key to achieving
practical quantum technologies. However, progress is hindered by the
exponential growth of quantum state spaces and the challenges posed by
realistic experimental conditions. Here, we present an AI framework that learns
to design pulse sequences for optimized quantum control over many-body spin
systems, providing a powerful alternative to theory-driven methods. The
framework combines customized tree search, neural network filtering, and
numerical simulation guidance to navigate highly nonlinear optimization
landscapes, using only desktop-level computational resources and minimal
experimental input. The objective function is set to preserve coherence, a key
prerequisite for quantum information processing. Our framework identifies over
900 high-performing sequences that exhibit non-intuitive structures and hence
challenge long-standing design principles, while established optimization
methods struggle to find such solutions. Experiments in a diamond spin ensemble
show that the best AI-designed sequences achieve coherence times exceeding 200
microseconds, representing a 100% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines
and approaching the temperature-imposed limit. Beyond spin coherence

### [75] [Optimal and Robust In-situ Quantum Hamiltonian Learning through Parallelization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07818)
*Suying Liu,Xiaodi Wu,Murphy Yuezhen Niu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Hamiltonian learning algorithm that achieves optimal precision and robustness to noise by exploiting device structure, reducing experimental cost, and enabling in-situ parameter estimation without requiring deep circuits or decoupling non-learnable interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the challenge of Hamiltonian learning, which is critical for advancing quantum simulations, improving device performance, and enabling quantum-enhanced sensing. Existing methods, while effective for specific cases, lack efficiency and practicality when applied to broader quantum systems. This paper aims to fill that gap by developing an algorithm that requires fewer resources and can handle realistic noise.

Method: The algorithm presented in this paper is designed to achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound saturated optimal precision, indicating it is theoretically optimal. It also reduces experimental cost by a quadratic factor for fully connected Hamiltonians. Additionally, it enables simultaneous in-situ estimation of all Hamiltonian parameters without requiring non-learnable interaction decoupling, which is a significant advancement in comprehensive system characterization. The approach is robust against depolarizing noise and time-dependent coherent errors and does not require deep circuits.

Result: The key results of this research include the development of an optimal Hamiltonian learning algorithm with reduced experimental cost, robustness to noise, and the ability to estimate parameters in-situ without requiring non-learnable interaction decoupling. The paper also provides a detailed experimental proposal and numerical simulations using Rydberg atom quantum simulators, demonstrating the algorithm's potential for high-precision Hamiltonian learning in the NISQ era.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in Hamiltonian learning by combining theoretical optimality with practicality. The algorithm's ability to handle realistic noise and reduce experimental costs makes it a promising tool for advancing quantum metrology and simulations in the near-term quantum era.

Abstract: Hamiltonian learning is a cornerstone for advancing accurate many-body
simulations, improving quantum device performance, and enabling
quantum-enhanced sensing. Existing readily deployable quantum metrology
techniques primarily focus on achieving Heisenberg-limited precision in one- or
two-qubit systems. In contrast, general Hamiltonian learning theories address
broader classes of unknown Hamiltonian models but are highly inefficient due to
the absence of prior knowledge about the Hamiltonian. There remains a lack of
efficient and practically realizable Hamiltonian learning algorithms that
directly exploit the known structure and prior information of the Hamiltonian,
which are typically available for a given quantum computing platform. In this
work, we present the first Hamiltonian learning algorithm that achieves both
Cramer-Rao lower bound saturated optimal precision and robustness to realistic
noise, while exploiting device structure for quadratic reduction in
experimental cost for fully connected Hamiltonians. Moreover, this approach
enables simultaneous in-situ estimation of all Hamiltonian parameters without
requiring the decoupling of non-learnable interactions during the same
experiment, thereby allowing comprehensive characterization of the system's
intrinsic contextual errors. Notably, our algorithm does not require deep
circuits and remains robust against both depolarizing noise and time-dependent
coherent errors. We demonstrate its effectiveness with a detailed experimental
proposal along with supporting numerical simulations on Rydberg atom quantum
simulators, showcasing its potential for high-precision Hamiltonian learning in
the NISQ era.

Abstract: In this work, we study the sample complexity of two variants of product
testing when restricted to single-copy measurements. In particular, we consider
both bipartite product testing (i.e., does there exist at least one non-trivial
cut across which the state is product) and multipartite product testing (i.e.,
is the state fully product across every cut). For the first variant, we prove
an exponential lower bound on the sample complexity of any algorithm for this
task which utilizes only single-copy measurements. When comparing this with
known efficient algorithms that utilize multi-copy measurements, this
establishes an exponential separation for this and several related entanglement
learning tasks. For the second variant, we prove another sample lower bound
that establishes a separation between single- and multi-copy strategies. To
obtain our results, we prove a crucial technical lemma that gives a lower bound
on the overlap between tensor products of permutation operators acting on
subsystems of states that themselves carry a tensor structure. Finally, we
provide an algorithm for multipartite product testing using only single-copy,
local measurements, and we highlight several interesting open questions arising
from this work.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子密码学中的EZ作贡献，特别是在量子密钥分发和相关协议的安全性上。

Abstract: We give a meta-complexity characterization of EFI pairs, which are considered
the "minimal" primitive in quantum cryptography (and are equivalent to quantum
commitments). More precisely, we show that the existence of EFI pairs is
equivalent to the following: there exists a non-uniformly samplable
distribution over pure states such that the problem of estimating a certain
Kolmogorov-like complexity measure is hard given a single copy.
  A key technical step in our proof, which may be of independent interest, is
to show that the existence of EFI pairs is equivalent to the existence of
non-uniform single-copy secure pseudorandom state generators (nu 1-PRS). As a
corollary, we get an alternative, arguably simpler, construction of a universal
EFI pair.

### [78] [Quantum Tanner Color Codes on Qubits with Transversal Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07864)
*Kyle Gulshen,Tali Kaufman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of high-dimensional expanders (HDX) in constructing quantum codes, focusing on transversal logical gates and symmetric non-product simplicial HDX. They introduce Tanner color codes, which generalize color codes, and prove an 'unfolding' theorem to characterize logical operators. The paper also demonstrates the construction of qubit codes on expanding coset complexes and conjectures their constant relative distance. The proof of concept is provided inpdim every dimension, and they explore the self-dual 2D family, highlighting its advantages and fault-tolerant gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve quantum error correction by leveraging properties of HDX.

Method: Developed a framework for transversal gates, generalized color codes, proved unfolding theorem, constructed codes on HDX, and analyzed their parameters.

Result: Presented new quantum codes with better parameters, constructed on non-product HDX, demonstrated strict transversal gates, conjectured constant relative distance, and provided a Floquet variant.

Conclusion: Established a new method for quantum code construction with better fault-tolerant properties using HDX.

Abstract: This work focuses on growing our understanding of how high dimensional
expanders (HDX) can be utilized to construct highly performant quantum codes.
While asymptotically good qLDPC codes have been constructed on 2D HDX built
from products of graphs, these constructions have a number of limitations, like
lack of structure useful for fault-tolerant logic. We develop a framework for
transversal logical gates that can naturally utilize symmetric non-product
simplicial HDX, and we demonstrate a particular code in this framework that
offers various advantages over prior constructions. Specifically, we study the
generalization of color codes to \emph{Tanner color codes}, which encompass
color, pin, and rainbow codes, and should enable constructions with better
parameters. We prove an `unfolding' theorem that characterizes the logical
operators of the Tanner color code in terms of logical operators from several
colored copies of the companion sheaf code. We leverage this understanding of
the logical operators to identify a local condition that ensures such a code on
a $D$-dimensional complex has a strictly-transversal $\frac{2 \pi}{2^D}$-phase
gate on a single block, $\frac{2 \pi}{2^\ell}$-phase gates on subsets of a
single block for $\ell<D$, and $C^{D-1}Z$ across $D$ blocks that preserve the
code space. We explicitly instantiate our paradigm in every dimension with
codes on highly-symmetric expanding coset complexes. These are the first qubit
codes explicitly defined on expanding (non-product) simplicial complexes. We
investigate in detail the self-dual 2D family, which has large rate $\geq
\frac{7}{64}$ and transversal $CZ$, $S$, and $H$ gates, among many other
fault-tolerant (generalizations of) fold-transversal gates arising from the
symmetry of the complex. We conjecture that it has constant relative distance.
We conclude by describing a Floquet variant of this code with check weight 4.

Motivation: Understanding such non-abelian generalizations is crucial for advancing quantum computing and quantum mechanics.

Method: The algorithm introduced in the paper specifically tackles the StateHSP for these dihedral groups.

Result: The algorithm achieves this in polynomial time and depth, which is a significant advancement.

Conclusion: This breakthrough also underpins progress in Hamiltonian spectroscopy and related symmetry studies in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The state hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) is a recent generalization of
the hidden subgroup problem. We present an algorithm that solves the
non-abelian StateHSP over $N$ copies of the dihedral group of order $8$ (the
symmetries of a square). This algorithm is of interest for learning non-Pauli
stabilizers, as well as related symmetries relevant for the problem of
Hamiltonian spectroscopy. Our algorithm is polynomial in the number of samples
and computational time, and requires only constant depth circuits. This result
extends previous work on the abelian StateHSP and, as a special case, provides
a solution for the ordinary hidden subgroup problem on this specific
non-abelian group.

Abstract: Quantum blockchains provide inherent resilience against quantum adversaries
and represent a promising alternative to classical blockchain systems in the
quantum era. However, existing quantum blockchain architectures largely depend
on entanglement to maintain inter-block connections, facing challenges in
stability, consensus efficiency, and system verification. To address these
issues, this work proposes a novel quantum blockchain framework based on
quantum walks, which reduces reliance on entanglement while improving stability
and connection efficiency. We further propose a quantum consensus mechanism
based on a weighted quantum voting protocol, which enables a fairer voting
process while reflecting the weights of different nodes. To validate the
proposed framework, we conduct circuit simulations to evaluate the correctness
and effectiveness of both the quantum walk-based block construction and the
quantum voting consensus mechanism. Compared with existing
entanglement-dependent approaches, our framework achieves stronger stability
and enables simpler verification of block integrity, making it a practical
candidate for quantum-era blockchain applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The gravitational fields of astrophysical bodies bend the light around them,
creating multiple paths along which light from a distant source can arrive at
Earth. Measuring the difference in photon arrival time along these different
paths provides a means of determining the mass of the lensing system, which is
otherwise difficult to constrain. This is particularly challenging in the case
of microlensing, where the images produced by lensing cannot be individually
resolved; existing proposals for detecting time delays in microlensed systems
are significantly constrained due to the need for large photon flux and the
loss of signal coherence when the angular diameter of the light source becomes
too large.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach to measuring astrophysical time
delays. Our method uses exponentially fewer photons than previous schemes,
enabling observations that would otherwise be impossible. Our approach, which
combines a quantum-inspired algorithm and quantum information processing
technologies, saturates a provable lower bound on the number of photons
required to find the time delay. Our scheme has multiple applications: we
explore its use both in calibrating optical interferometric telescopes and in
making direct mass measurements of ongoing microlensing events. To demonstrate
the latter, we present a fiducial example of microlensed stellar flares sources
in the Galactic Bulge. Though the number of photons produced by such events is
small, we show that our photon-efficient scheme opens the possibility of
directly measuring microlensing time delays using existing and near-future
ground-based telescopes.

Conclusion: 该方法为降低量子退火复杂度提供了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI), a quantum
algorithm that utilizes coherent Bell measurements and the symplectic
representation of the Pauli group to reduce Gibbs sampling and Hamiltonian
optimization to classical decoding. For a signed Pauli Hamiltonian $H$ and any
degree-$\ell$ polynomial ${P}$, HDQI prepares a purification of the density
matrix $\rho_{P}(H) \propto {P}^2(H)$ by solving a combination of two tasks:
decoding $\ell$ errors on a classical code defined by $H$, and preparing a
pilot state that encodes the anti-commutation structure of $H$. Choosing $P(x)$
to approximate $\exp(-\beta x/2)$ yields Gibbs states at inverse temperature
$\beta$; other choices prepare approximate ground states, microcanonical
ensembles, and other spectral filters.
  For local Hamiltonians, the corresponding decoding problem is that of LDPC
codes. Preparing the pilot state is always efficient for commuting
Hamiltonians, but highly non-trivial for non-commuting Hamiltonians.
Nevertheless, we prove that this state admits an efficient matrix product state
representation for Hamiltonians whose anti-commutation graph decomposes into
connected components of logarithmic size.
  We show that HDQI efficiently prepares Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures
for a class of physically motivated commuting Hamiltonians -- including the
toric code and Haah's cubic code -- but we also develop a matching efficient
classical algorithm for this task. For a non-commuting semiclassical spin glass
and commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians with quantum defects, HDQI prepares Gibbs
states up to a constant inverse-temperature threshold using polynomial quantum
resources and quasi-polynomial classical pre-processing. These results position
HDQI as a versatile algorithmic primitive and the first extension of Regev's
reduction to non-abelian groups.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks, which often face difficulties due to non-convex optimization and the curse of dimensionality.

Method: The method involves constructing a quantum random feature method (QRFM) that leverages quantum computing to enhance the classical RFM framework.

Result: A complexity analysis demonstrates that this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup over the classical RFM.

Conclusion: The proposed QRFM offers a promising approach to solving complex scientific computing problems through quantum-assisted numerical methods.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds significant promise for scientific computing due to
its potential for polynomial to even exponential speedups over classical
methods, which are often hindered by the curse of dimensionality. While neural
networks present a mesh-free alternative to solve partial differential
equations (PDEs), their accuracy is difficult to achieve since one needs to
solve a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using the stochastic
gradient descent method and its variants, the convergence of which is difficult
to prove and cannot be guaranteed. The classical random feature method (RFM)
effectively merges advantages from both classical numerical analysis and neural
network based techniques, achieving spectral accuracy and a natural
adaptability to complex geometries. In this work, we introduce a quantum random
feature method (QRFM) that leverages quantum computing to accelerate the
classical RFM framework. Our method constructs PDE solutions using
quantum-generated random features and enforces the governing equations via a
collocation approach. A complexity analysis demonstrates that this hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup over the classical
RFM.

Abstract: We unconditionally prove that it is NP-hard to compute a constant
multiplicative approximation to the QUANTUM MAX-CUT problem on an unweighted
graph of constant bounded degree. The proof works in two stages: first we
demonstrate a generic reduction to computing the optimal value of a quantum
problem, from the optimal value over product states. Then we prove an
approximation preserving reduction from MAX-CUT to PRODUCT-QMC the product
state version of QUANTUM MAX-CUT. More precisely, in the second part, we
construct a PTAS reduction from MAX-CUT$_k$ (the rank-k constrained version of
MAX-CUT) to MAX-CUT$_{k+1}$, where MAX-CUT and PRODUCT-QMC coincide with
MAX-CUT$_1$ and MAX-CUT$_3$ respectively. We thus prove that Max-Cut$_k$ is
APX-complete for all constant $k$.

unoperation produces a set of all valid inputs to $\hat{O}$ that produce the
given output. Further, the working principle of unoperations is illustrated
using the example of addition. A device providing that functionality is
constructed utilising a quantum circuit performing the unoperation of addition
- referred to as unaddition. To highlight the potential of the approach the
unaddition quantum circuit is employed to construct a device for factoring
integer numbers $N$, which is then called unmultiplier. This approach requires
only a number of qubits $\in \mathcal{O}((\log{N})^2)$, rivalling the best

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to optimize satellite communication by leveraging quantum technology to improve the efficiency and reliability of ground stations, particularly in challenging environments.

Method: The method involves analyzing the fundamental limits of communication introduced by Shannon, Gordon, and Holevo, and applying quantum operations to a system known as the Joint Detector Receiver to evaluate its performance in detecting beacon signals under various conditions.

Result: The key results are that quantum technology significantly enhances the performance of ground stations by reducing the time required to detect beacon signals, thereby extending the active time window available for satellite operations. Specifically, under bad weather conditions, this enhancement is nearly a factor of 20.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the integration of quantum technology into the design of ground stations for satellite communications, particularly through the use of the Joint Detector Receiver, offers a substantial improvement in signal detection speed and network operation availability under adverse conditions.

Abstract: We study the quantum limits of the ELROI beacon concept introduced by Holmes,
Weaver, and Palmer. In this concept, a satellite continuously emits a weak
optical signal to broadcast its identity. Via analysis of the fundamental
limits on communication introduced by Shannon, Gordon, and Holevo, we
demonstrate that in such scenarios, incorporating quantum technology into the
design of a ground station significantly enhances performance. Specifically,
the Time-To-Read the beacon signal and thereby identify the satellite is
greatly reduced in situations where weather conditions obstruct the signal,
allowing the Active Time Window, during which the satellite can be utilized for
subsequent network operations, to be extended by nearly a factor of 20. In this
particular case, the quantum technology concept that is employed is the
so-called Joint Detector Receiver, which is a system aiming to operate at the

TL;DR: A real-time decoder for topological codes that operates without global control, using local classical processors to simulate confinement of quantum errors and achieve finite threshold error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes, which is crucial for reliable quantum computation. Existing methods often rely on complex syndrome measurements and global control, which may be difficult to implement in large-scale quantum systems.

Method: The approach involves simulating the confinement of quantum errors through an array of local classical processors. These processors measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighbors, and move quantum excitations based on received messages to implement logical operations. The decoder operates in a self-organized, geometrically local manner without any global control.

Result: The decoder achieves optimal error correction with a memory lifetime that scales as a stretched exponential in system size. For the surface code under depolarizing noise, a threshold error rate of approximately 1.5% is reached.

Conclusion: This method offers a promising alternative for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, leveraging local classical processors to eliminate the need for global control while maintaining high fault-tolerance thresholds.

Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in
topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We
implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure
syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations
using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is
geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating
without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder
requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each
qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory
lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface
code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength,
numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.

Abstract: A recent paper by Jordan et al. introduced Decoded Quantum Interferometry
(DQI), a novel quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to
reduce linear optimization problems -- max-XORSAT and max-LINSAT -- to decoding
problems. In this paper, we extend DQI to optimization problems involving
quadratic constraints, which we call max-QUADSAT. Leveraging a connection to
quadratic Gauss sums, we give an efficient algorithm to prepare the DQI state
for max-QUADSAT. To demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a quantum
advantage, we introduce the Quadratic Optimal Polynomial Intersection
(quadratic-OPI) problem, a restricted variant of OPI for which, to our
knowledge, the standard DQI framework offers no algorithmic speedup. We show
that quadratic-OPI is an instance of max-QUADSAT and use our algorithm to
optimize it. Lastly, we present a new generalized proof of the "semicircle law"
for the fraction of satisfied constraints, generalizing it to any DQI state of
problems where the distribution of the number of satisfied constraints for a
random assignment is sufficiently close to a binomial distribution. This
condition holds exactly for the DQI state of max-LINSAT, and approximately
holds in the max-QUADSAT case, with the approximation becoming exponentially
better as the problem size increases. This establishes performance guarantees
for our algorithm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing interest in understanding when and how postulates of quantum mechanics are experimentally testable, particularly for large quantum systems. Efficient verification methods for quantum states are increasingly important for quantum computing.

Method: The authors employ quantum circuit lower bound techniques, building on established quantum circuit complexity theory, leveraging the stabilizer rank and operator norm, as well as introduce a quantum generalization of antichain dimension.

Result: The paper presents a concrete separation between (c - 1)-copy and c-copy measurements, demonstrating an exponential hardness improvement by one qudit measurement. It identifies explicit learning tasks of degree c that are efficiently solvable with c-copy measurements but require exponentially many with fewer.

Conclusion: This work implies that the number of copies in measurement is a critical parameter in quantum state certification. It highlights the role of reliable quantum memory as a key resource for exponential quantum advantage, placing resource trade-offs at the forefront of near-term quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Learning properties of quantum states from measurement data is a fundamental
challenge in quantum information. The sample complexity of such tasks depends
crucially on the measurement primitive. While shadow tomography achieves
sample-efficient learning by allowing entangling measurements across many
copies, it requires prohibitively deep circuits. At the other extreme, two-copy
measurements already yield exponential advantages over single-copy strategies
in tasks such as Pauli tomography. In this work we show that such sharp
separations extend far beyond the two-copy regime: for every prime c we
construct explicit learning tasks of degree c, which are exponentially hard
with (c - 1)-copy measurements but efficiently solvable with c-copy
measurements. Our protocols are not only sample-efficient but also realizable
with shallow circuits. Extending further, we show that such finite-degree tasks
exist for all square-free integers c, pointing toward a general principle
underlying their existence. Together, our results reveal an infinite hierarchy
of multi-copy learning problems, uncovering new phase transitions in sample
complexity and underscoring the role of reliable quantum memory as a key
resource for exponential quantum advantage.

Abstract: Secure key leasing allows a cryptographic key to be leased as a quantum state
in such a way that the key can later be revoked in a verifiable manner. In this
work, we propose a modular framework for constructing secure key leasing with a
classical-lessor, where the lessor is entirely classical and, in particular,
the quantum secret key can be both leased and revoked using only classical
communication. Based on this framework, we obtain classical-lessor secure key
leasing schemes for public-key encryption (PKE), pseudorandom function (PRF),
and digital signature. We adopt the strong security notion known as security
against verification key revealing attacks (VRA security) proposed by Kitagawa
et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) into the classical-lessor setting, and we prove that
all three of our schemes satisfy this notion under the learning with errors
assumption. Our PKE scheme improves upon the previous construction by Goyal et
al. (Eurocrypt 2025), and our PRF and digital signature schemes are
respectively the first PRF and digital signature with classical-lessor secure
key leasing property.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A general approach to modeling irreversibility starting from microscopic
reversibility is presented. The time $t_s$ up to which relevant degrees of
freedom of a system are tracked is extremely much shorter than the spectral
resolution time $t_e$ that would be necessary to resolve the spectrum of all
degrees of freedom involved. A relaxator that breaks reversibility condenses in
the Liouville operator of the relevant degrees of freedom. The irrelevant
degrees of freedom act as an environment to the system. The irreversible
relaxator Liouville equation contains memory effects and initial correlations
of all degrees of freedom. Stationary states turn out to be generically unique
and independent of the initial conditions and exceptions are due to
degeneracies. Equilibrium states lie in the relaxator's kernel yielding a
stationary Pauli master equation. Kinetic equations for oneparticle densities
are constructed as special cases of relaxator Liouville dynamics. Kubo's linear
response theory is generalized to relaxator Liouville dynamics and related to
irreversibility within the system. In a weak coupling approximation between
system and environment the relaxator can be reduced to environmental
correlations and bilinear system operators. Markov approximation turns the
relaxator Liouville dynamics into a semi-group dynamics.

*Chun-Tse Li,Tzen Ong,Chih-Yun Lin,Yu-Cheng Chen,Hsin Lin,Min-Hsiu Hsieh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum algorithm is proposed to directly diagonalize quasi-degenerate low-energy manifolds without resolution beyond intra-manifold splitting. The method reduces the problem to a low-dimensional subspace, solves it, and lifts solutions to the full Hilbert space. It provides query complexity, accuracy, and handles various systems effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems arise in quantum chemistry, condensed-matter physics, and involve nearly degenerate states that determine physical properties. Solving these problems accurately and efficiently is critical in these fields.

Method: The algorithm directly diagonalizes quasi-degenerate manifolds by solving an effective Hamiltonian eigenproblem within a low-dimensional reference subspace. It constructs a block-encoded wave operator to lift solutions from the subspace to the full Hilbert space.

Result: The algorithm shows provable bounds on eigenvalue accuracy and subspace fidelity, with favorable query complexity. When benchmarked on systems like the Fermi-Hubbard model, LiH, and a Ru(bpy)3 complex, it demonstrates robust performance and reliable resolution of quasi-degeneracies.

Conclusion: This novel quantum approach efficiently handles quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems, offering a valuable tool for tackling complex quantum phenomena in physics and chemistry without the need for fine spectral gap resolution.

Abstract: Quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems are central to quantum chemistry and
condensed-matter physics, where low-energy spectra often form manifolds of
nearly degenerate states that determine physical properties. Standard quantum
algorithms, such as phase estimation and QSVT-based eigenvalue filtering, work
well when a unique ground state is separated by a moderate spectral gap, but in
the quasi-degenerate regime they require resolution finer than the
intra-manifold splitting; otherwise, they return an uncontrolled superposition
within the low-energy span and fail to detect or resolve degeneracies. In this
work, we propose a quantum algorithm that directly diagonalizes such
quasi-degenerate manifolds by solving an effective-Hamiltonian eigenproblem in
a low-dimensional reference subspace. This reduced problem is exactly
equivalent to the full eigenproblem, and its solutions are lifted to the full
Hilbert space via a block-encoded wave operator. Our analysis provides provable
bounds on eigenvalue accuracy and subspace fidelity, together with total query
complexity, demonstrating that quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems can be
solved efficiently without assuming any intra-manifold splitting. We benchmark
the algorithm on several systems (the Fermi-Hubbard model, LiH, and the
transition-metal complex [Ru(bpy)$_3$]$^{2+}$), demonstrating robust
performance and reliable resolution of (quasi-)degeneracies.

Abstract: Magnomechanical systems with YIG spheres have been proven to be an ideal
system for studying magnomechanically induced transparency, dynamical
backaction, and rich nonlinear effects, such as the magnon-phonon cross-Kerr
effect. Accurate characterization of the magnetostriction induced deformation
displacement is important as it can be used for, e.g., estimating the magnon
excitation number and the strength of the dynamical backaction. Here we propose
an optical approach for detecting the magnetostrictive deformation of a YIG
sphere in three dimensions (3Ds) with high precision. It is based on the
deformation induced spatial high-order modes of the scattered field,
postselection, and balanced homodyne detection. With feasible parameters, we
show that the measurement precision of the deformation in $x$, $y$, and $z$
directions can reach the picometer level. We further reveal the advantages of
our scheme using a higher-order probe beam and balanced homodyne detection by
means of quantum and classical Fisher information. The real-time and
high-precision measurement of the YIG sphere's deformation in 3Ds can be used
to determinate specific mechanical modes, characterize the magnomechanical
dynamical backaction and the 3D cooling of the mechanical vibration, and thus
finds a wide range of applications in magnomechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子信息在密码学、算法和误差校正中的重要性日益凸显，如何高效地构造近似 Haar 随机的单元ary k 设计成为了一个亟待解决的问题。现有的方法往往需要大量的非 Clifford 每artes 资本，这在实际应用中可能带来高昂的成本。因此，开发一种在资源消耗上更为高效的、同时具备全量子安全性的新方法显得尤为重要。

Method: 该论文提出的方法基于'量子 homeopathy'的原理，通过将 k 设计应用于一个子系统的部分量子位（大小为 Θ(k)），然后再通过夹杂两个随机 Clifford 转换将其扩展到整个 n 量子位系统。这种方法使得非 Clifford 每artes 资本在系统大小扩大时保持不变，从而显著降低了非 Clifford 每artes 的总成本。

Result: 论文的主要结果包括：1) 该方法在对抗敌方量子测量的全量子安全下，仅需 Ω(k) 个非 Clifford 转换；2) 对于仅需对抗多项式时间量子攻击的情况，非 Clifford 转换的数量降低至 ~O(k + log^{1+c} 1/ε)；3) 这是首次同时实现对抗量子攻击和无额外假设的更优结果；4) 相较于现有方法，该方法在非 Clifford 资本和安全性上均表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 该研究通过一种创新性的'量子 homeopathy'协议，为实现高效而安全的高阶单元ary 设计提供了切实可行的解决方案。该方法不仅降低了非 Clifford 资本的需求，还增强了安全性，使其适用于更广泛的量子计算架构。这些成果为量子信息领域的进一步发展奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Randomness is a fundamental resource in quantum information, with crucial
applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. A central
challenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate
Haar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford
operations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able
to generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial
quantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford
gates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design
only to a subsystem of size $\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This "seed" design
is then "diluted" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between
two random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an
$\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this
construction achieves full quantum security against adaptive adversaries using
only $\tilde{O}(k^2 \log\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requires
security only against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford
cost decreases to $\tilde{O}(k + \log^{1+c} \varepsilon^{-1})$. This is
optimal, since we show that at least $\Omega(k)$ non-Clifford gates are
required in this setting. Compared to existing approaches, our method
significantly reduces non-Clifford overhead while strengthening security
guarantees to adaptive security as well as removing artificial assumptions
between $n$ and $k$. These results make high-order unitary designs practically
attainable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum architectures.

Method: 研究者通过构建特定类别的线性哈密顿量，并证明了它们的资源状态的存在性，进而分析使用 highly entangled states 在 metrology 中的无用性。

Result: 数值模拟和理论分析表明，高度纠缠态在 metrology 中无用，尤其是当处理更广泛的哈密顿量时。随机纯态由于其高度纠缠，进一步强化了这种无用性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在 metrology 中高度纠缠态是无用的，特别是在处理更复杂的哈密顿量时。因此，可以合理地认为，随机纯态在 metrology 中同样无用。

Abstract: We show (i) the existence of universal resource states for a certain class of

*Joona V. Pankkonen,Matti Raasakka,Andrea Marchesin,Ilkka Tittonen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are essential for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) on NISQ devices. They are optimized using methods like the parameter-shift rule and hybrid algorithms, with recent advancements in hybrid optimizers showing improved performance and robustness across various noise profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing PQCs, which are pivotal for quantum computing applications on noisy NISQ devices.

Method: The authors propose new hybrid optimization algorithms inspired by classical machine learning's early stopping technique. These algorithms adaptively switch between optimizers based on cost function performance.

Result: The new hybrid algorithms demonstrate superior convergence to global minima and are effective for different noise profiles in NISQ devices.

Conclusion: The development of these hybrid optimizers represents a significant step forward in enhancing the practicality of PQCs for real-world quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the
application of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) in noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The PQCs are a leading candidate to
achieve a quantum advantage in NISQ devices and have already been applied in
various domains such as quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, and many others. There is no single definitive way
to optimize PQCs. The most commonly used methods are based on computing the
gradient via the parameter-shift rule to use classical gradient descent (GD)
optimizers like Adam, stochastic GD, and others. In addition, sequential
single-qubit optimizers have been proposed, such as Rotosolve, Free-Axis
Selection (Fraxis), Free-Quaternion Selection (FQS), and hybrid algorithms from
the aforementioned optimizers. We further develop hybrid algorithms than those
represented in the previous work by drawing inspiration from the early stopping
method used in classical machine learning. The switch between the optimizers
depends on the previous cost function values compared to the previous ones. We
introduce two new hybrid algorithms that are more robust and scalable, and they
outperform previous hybrid methods in terms of convergence towards the global
minima across various cost functions. In addition, we find that they are
feasible for NISQ devices with different noise profiles.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  papers analyze the performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with focus on how classical parameters affect its success, especially for low-depth circuits. They find that optimal parameters don't follow expected patterns, QAOA becomes less sensitive to parameter choices as depth increases, and simple iterative methods work as well as or better than established strategies for shallow depths. They also identify when structured parameter patterns emerge or when deviations need further consideration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  research into quantum algorithms like QAOA is crucial for leveraging near-term quantum hardware. Understanding parameter sensitivity is key for optimizing algorithm performance and practical applications.

Method:  extensive numerical simulations of QAOA across various problem classes and depths to analyze parameter sensitivity and effectiveness of different parameter-selection strategies.

Result:  Optimal parameters often deviate from expected patterns, QAOA performance is less sensitive to parameters as depth increases, and iterative fixing performs well for low-depth. Also, they determine conditions for structured parameter patterns and deviations.

Conclusion:  Insights for low-depth QAOA can enhance its practicality in noisy NISQ devices. Future research should consider when to use structured parameters and when iterative methods are preferable for higher depths.

Abstract: Structured variational quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate
Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) have emerged as leading candidates for exploiting
advantages of near-term quantum hardware. They interlace classical computation,
in particular optimisation of variational parameters, with quantum-specific
routines, and combine problem-specific advantages -- sometimes even provable --
with adaptability to the constraints of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices. While circuit depth can be parametrically increased and is
known to improve performance in an ideal (noiseless) setting, on realistic
hardware greater depth exacerbates noise: The overall quality of results
depends critically on both, variational parameters and circuit depth. Although
identifying optimal parameters is NP-hard, prior work has suggested that they
may exhibit regular, predictable patterns for increasingly deep circuits and
depending on the studied class of problems. In this work, we systematically
investigate the role of classical parameters in QAOA performance through
extensive numerical simulations and suggest a simple, yet effective heuristic
scheme to find good parameters for low-depth circuits. Our results demonstrate
that: (i) optimal parameters often deviate substantially from expected
patterns; (ii) QAOA performance becomes progressively less sensitive to
specific parameter choices as depth increases; and (iii) iterative
component-wise fixing performs on par with, and at shallow depth may even
outperform, several established parameter-selection strategies. We identify
conditions under which structured parameter patterns emerge, and when
deviations from the patterns warrant further consideration. These insights for
low-depth circuits may inform more robust pathways to harnessing QAOA in
realistic quantum compute scenarios.

Abstract: Many quantum information tasks use inputs of the form $\rho^{\otimes m}$,
which naturally induce permutation and unitary symmetries. We classify all
quantum channels that respect both symmetries - i.e. unitary-equivariant and
permutation-invariant quantum channels from $(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes m}$ to
$(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes n}$ - via their extremal points. Operationally, each
extremal quantum channel factors as unitary Schur sampling $\rightarrow$ an
irrep-level unitary-equivariant quantum channel $\rightarrow$ the adjoint
unitary Schur sampling. We give a streaming implementation ansatz that uses an
efficient streaming implementation of unitary Schur sampling together with a
resource-state primitive, and we apply it to state symmetrization, symmetric
cloning, and purity amplification. In these applications we obtain
polynomial-time algorithms with exponential memory improvements in $m,n$.
Further, for symmetric cloning we present, to our knowledge, the first
efficient (polynomial-time) algorithm with explicit memory and gate bounds.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As quantum devices scale, quantifying how close an experimental state aligns
with a target becomes both vital and challenging. Fidelity is the standard
metric, but existing estimators either require full tomography or apply only to
restricted state/measurement families. Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar
(Nature Physics, 2025) introduced an efficient certification protocol for
Haar-random states using only a polynomial number of non-adaptive, single-copy,
local Pauli measurements. Here, we adopt the same data collection routine but
recast it as a fidelity estimation protocol with rigorous performance
guarantees and broaden its applicability. We analyze the bias in this
estimator, linking its performance to the mixing time $\tau$ of a Markov chain
induced by the target state, and resolve the three open questions posed by
Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2025). Our analysis extends
beyond Haar-random states to state $t$-designs, states prepared by low-depth
random circuits, physically relevant states and families of mixed states. We
introduce a $k$-generalized local escape property that identifies when the
fidelity estimation protocol is both efficient and accurate, and design a
practical empirical test to verify its applicability for arbitrary states. This
work enables scalable benchmarking, error characterization, and tomography
assistance, supports adaptive quantum algorithms in high dimensions, and
clarifies fundamental limits of learning from local measurements.

Abstract: Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal
temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we
analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a
Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative.
Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to
an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum
control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static
Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features
directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically
varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection
and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the
evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike
the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the
fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the
degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable
through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer
potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our
findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in
other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as
graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order
evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.

Abstract: Calculating the quantum weight enumerator polynomial (WEP) is a valuable tool
for characterizing quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes, but it is
computationally hard for large or complex codes. The Quantum LEGO (QL)
framework provides a tensor network approach for WEP calculation, in some cases
offering superpolynomial speedups over brute-force methods, provided the code
exhibits area law entanglement, that a good QL layout is used, and an efficient
tensor network contraction schedule is found. We analyze the performance of a
hyper-optimized contraction schedule framework across QL layouts for diverse
stabilizer code families. We find that the intermediate tensors in the QL
networks for stabilizer WEPs are often highly sparse, invalidating the
dense-tensor assumption of standard cost functions. To address this, we
introduce an exact, polynomial-time Sparse Stabilizer Tensor (SST) cost
function based on the rank of the parity check matrices for intermediate
tensors. The SST cost function correlates perfectly with the true contraction
cost, providing a significant advantage over the default cost function, which
exhibits large uncertainty. Optimizing contraction schedules using the SST cost
function yields substantial performance gains, achieving up to orders of
magnitude improvement in actual contraction cost compared to using the dense
tensor cost function. Furthermore, the precise cost estimation from the SST
function offers an efficient metric to decide whether the QL-based WEP

These results, enabled by PlanqTN, a new open-source QL implementation,
validate hyper-optimized contraction as a crucial technique for leveraging the
QL framework to explore the QEC code design space.

Abstract: In precision force sensing of multi-mechanical mode optomechanical systems,
coherent interference can decouple certain degenerate vibrational modes from
the cavity field, leading to incomplete information regarding the measured
signal. In this paper, we propose a scheme to enhance and control the detection
bandwidth in optomechanical force sensing by exploiting synthetic magnetism
achieved through tuning phonon hopping interactions. By toggling between broken
and unbroken dark mode, this approach effectively manages the response
bandwidth and exhibits intriguing additional noise characteristics.
Specifically, when the dark mode remains unbroken, the thermal noise is robust
and reduced to half of that of a standard device. In contrast, when the dark
mode is broken, thermal noise increases substantially at mechanical resonance
but remains the same as when the dark mode is unbroken at effective detection
frequencies. Moreover, our scheme offers the dual benefit of amplifying the
mechanical response while suppressing additional noise, with the potential to
surpass the standard quantum limit.

Motivation: The paper seeks to address the existence of operational protocols for certifying separability in quantum systems, building on the idea that classicality is pragmatic.

Method: The authors use a purely topological, interpretation-independent representation to explore the non-existence of such protocols.

Result: The study concludes that no operational protocols exist for certifying separability, reinforcing the pragmatic nature of classicality.

Conclusion: This finding supports Bohr's view that classicality is inherently pragmatic and not tied to any specific interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The existence and practical utility of operational protocols that certify
entanglement raises the question of whether operational protocols exist that
certify the absence of entanglement, i.e. that certify separability. We show,
within a purely topological, interpretation-independent representation, that
such protocols do not exist. Classicality is therefore, as Bohr suggested,
purely a pragmatic notion.

Abstract: Binary optimisation tasks are ubiquitous in areas ranging from logistics to
cryptography. The exponential complexity of such problems means that the
performance of traditional computational methods decreases rapidly with
increasing problem sizes. Here, we propose a new algorithm for binary
optimisation, the Bosonic Binary Solver, designed for near-term photonic
quantum processors. This variational algorithm uses samples from a quantum
optical circuit, which are post-processed using trainable classical bit-flip
probabilities, to propose candidate solutions. A gradient-based training loop
finds progressively better solutions until convergence. We perform ablation
tests that validate the structure of the algorithm. We then evaluate its
performance on an illustrative range of binary optimisation problems, using
both simulators and real hardware, and perform comparisons to classical
algorithms. We find that this algorithm produces high-quality solutions to
these problems. As such, this algorithm is a promising method for leveraging
the scalable nature of photonic quantum processors to solve large-scale
real-world optimisation problems.

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for weak transversal gates -- probabilistic
implementation of logical unitaries realized by local physical unitaries -- and
propose a novel partially fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture that
surpasses the standard Clifford+T architecture on workloads with million-scale
Clifford+T gate counts. First, we prove the existence of weak transversal gates
on the class of Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes, covering high-rate qLDPC and
topological codes such as surface code or color codes, and present an efficient
algorithm to determine the physical multi-qubit Pauli rotations required for
the desired logical rotation. Second, we propose a partially fault-tolerant
Clifford+$\phi$ architecture that performs in-place Pauli rotations via a
repeat-until-success strategy; phenomenological simulations indicate that a
rotation of 0.003 attains logical error of $9.5\times10^{-5}$ on a surface code
with $d=7$ at physical error rate of $10^{-4}$, while avoiding the spacetime
overheads of magic state factories, small angle synthesis, and routing.
Finally, we perform resource estimation on surface and gross codes for a
Trotter-like circuit with $N=108$ logical qubits to show that the
Clifford+$\phi$ architecture outperforms the conventional Clifford+T approach
by a factor of tens to a hundred in runtime due to natural rotation-gate
parallelism. This work open a novel paradigm for realizing logical operations
beyond the constraints of conventional design.

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in
various applications and are known to be NP-hard. The seminal work of Goemans
and Williamson introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for such
problems, solvable in polynomial time that upper bounds the optimal value.
Their approach also enables randomized rounding techniques to obtain feasible
solutions with provable performance guarantees.
  In this work, we identify instances of QUBO problems where matrix
multiplicative weight methods lead to quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms
that approximate the Goemans-Williamson SDP exponentially faster than existing
methods, achieving polylogarithmic time complexity relative to the problem
dimension. This speedup is attainable under the assumption that the QUBO cost
matrix is sparse when expressed as a linear combination of Pauli strings
satisfying certain algebraic constraints, and leverages efficient quantum and
classical simulation results for quantum Gibbs states.
  We demonstrate how to verify these conditions efficiently given the
decomposition. Additionally, we explore heuristic methods for randomized
rounding procedures and extract the energy of a feasible point of the QUBO in
polylogarithmic time. While the practical relevance of instances where our
methods excel remains to be fully established, we propose heuristic algorithms
with broader applicability and identify Kronecker graphs as a promising class
for applying our techniques. We conduct numerical experiments to benchmark our
methods. Notably, by utilizing tensor network methods, we solve an SDP with $D
= 2^{50}$ variables and extract a feasible point which is certifiably within
$0.15\%$ of the optimum of the QUBO through our approach on a desktop, reaching
dimensions millions of times larger than those handled by existing SDP or QUBO
solvers, whether heuristic or rigorous.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally
constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture
how strategic decision-making under uncertainty -- particularly an agent's
tolerance for risk -- determines the trade-off between extractable work and
probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a
framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource
theories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an
agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as
a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal
betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function.
Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward
trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of
extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk
sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a
rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by
a R\'enyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and
gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an
adversarial setup.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum memory systems for approximately
retaining quantum information, such as initial dynamic variables or quantum
states to be stored over a bounded time interval. In the Heisenberg picture of
quantum dynamics, the deviation of the system variables from their initial
values lends itself to closed-form computation in terms of tractable moment
dynamics for open quantum harmonic oscillators and finite-level quantum systems
governed by linear or quasi-linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic
differential equations, respectively. This tractability is used in a recently
proposed optimality criterion for varying the system parameters so as to
maximise the memory decoherence time when the mean-square deviation achieves a
given critical threshold. The memory decoherence time maximisation approach is
extended beyond the previously considered low-threshold asymptotic
approximation and to Schr\"{o}dinger type mean-square deviation functionals for
the reduced system state governed by the Lindblad master equation. We link this
approach with the minimisation of the mean-square deviation functionals at a
finite time horizon and with their discounted version which quantifies the
averaged performance of the quantum system as a temporary memory under a
Poisson flow of storage requests.

Abstract: We developed a general framework for synthesizing target gates by using a
finite set of basic gates, which is a crucial step in quantum compilation. When
approximating a gate in SU($n$), a naive brute-force search requires a
computational complexity of $O(1/\varepsilon^{(n^2 - 1)})$ to achieve an
approximation with error $\varepsilon$. In contrast, by using our method, the
complexity can be reduced to $O(-n^2 \log\varepsilon/\varepsilon^{((n^2 -
1)/2)})$. This method requires almost no assumptions and can be applied to a
variety of gate sets, including Clifford+$T$ and Clifford+$V$. Further, we
introduce a suboptimal but short run-time algorithm for synthesizing
multi-qubit controlled gates. This approach highlights the role of subgroup
structures in reducing synthesis complexity and opens a new direction of study
on the compilation of multi-qubit gates. The framework is broadly applicable to
different universal gate sets, and our analysis suggests that it can serve as a
foundation for resource-efficient quantum compilation in near-term
architectures.

Abstract: Scaling up the number of qubits available on quantum processors remains
technically demanding even in the long term; it is therefore crucial to clarify
the number of qubits required to implement a given quantum operation. For the
most general class of quantum operations, known as quantum instruments, the
qubit requirements are not well understood, especially when mid-circuit
measurements and delayed input preparation are permitted. In this work, we
characterize lower and upper bounds on the number of qubits required to
implement a given quantum instrument in terms of the causal structure of the
instrument. We further apply our results to entanglement distillation protocols
based on stabilizer codes and show that, in these cases, the lower and upper
bounds coincide, so the optimal qubit requirement is determined. In particular,
we compute that the optimal number of qubits is 3 for the
$[[9,1,3]]$-code-based protocol and 4 for the $[[5,1,3]]$-code-based protocol.

our aim is to disentangle the effect of the catalyst from that of classical

catalytic local operations (CLO) and compare it to LOCC and to stochastic LOCC
augmented by bounded quantum communication. We show that these classes are
incomparable and capture different facets of quantum state transformations.

Abstract: Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused
largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics
from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse
systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits.
Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a
non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic
systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this
phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement
growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism
creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes
pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move''
dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes
entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are
``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of
the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified
perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our
understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum
many-body systems.

Abstract: We introduce a generic framework for solving linear programs (LPs) with many
constraints $(n \gg d)$ via adaptive sparsification. Our approach provides a
principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching
problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm
for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls
to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which
we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method.
  Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we
present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution
to an LP using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix.
This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for
violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the
quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new
state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the
packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while
sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width
reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query
models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP
solvers.

Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry typically gives rise to emergent
excitations possessing the same symmetry with a renormalized mass. Contrary to
this conventional wisdom, we present a theory in which the low-lying excitation
in the broken-symmetry phase acquires a continuous symmetry, even when the
underlying symmetry of the system is discrete. In the presence of anisotropic
long-range interactions, the order parameter renormalizes the relative strength
of the particle-conserving and particle-nonconserving interactions. When one of
the two renormalized interactions vanishes, a conservation law absent in the
original Hamiltonian emerges, giving rise to a continuous symmetry. A striking
consequence of the emergent continuous symmetry and conservation law is that it
constrains quantum correlations in the ground-state to be zero, leading to the
ground-state factorization in the presence of strong interactions. Our finding
is a universal feature of quantum phase transitions in fully-connected systems
and in their lattice generalizations; therefore, it can be observed in a wide
range of physical systems.

Abstract: A classical obfuscator for quantum circuits is a classical program that,
given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, outputs the classical
description of a functionally equivalent quantum circuit $\hat{Q}$ that hides
as much as possible about $Q$. Previously, the only known feasibility result
for classical obfuscation of quantum circuits (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS
2022) was limited to circuits that always reject. On the other hand, if the
obfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit $Q$ into a quantum state
$|\hat{Q}\rangle$, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating all
pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and
Yamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and
all unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025).
  We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical
obfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. We do this by giving
the first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE)
scheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum
evaluation, relative to a classical oracle.
  To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on the approach of Bartusek,
Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which required ciphertexts that
are both quantum and non-compact due to the use of quantum coset states and
their publicly-verifiable properties. We introduce new techniques for analyzing
coset states that can be generated ''on the fly'', by proving new cryptographic
properties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO
2025). Our techniques allow us to produce QFHE ciphertexts that are purely
classical, compact, and publicly-verifiable. This also yields the first
classical verification of quantum computation protocol for BQP that
simultaneously satisfies blindness and public-verifiability.

Abstract: We propose a scheme for the fault-tolerant implementation of arbitrary

syndrome extraction to a general framework that flags any Clifford circuit.
This framework opens new pathways toward universal fault tolerance by allowing
transversal implementation of $T$ gates alongside fault-tolerant realization of
selected non-transversal Clifford gates using flags. The construction we
present allows a Clifford circuit consisting of $n$ two-qubit gates and $O(n)$
single-qubit gates acting upon physical qubits in a code of distance $d$ to be
made fault tolerant to distance $d$ using $O(d^2 \log(nd^2\log n))$ ancilla
qubits and $O(nd^2 \log(nd^2 \log n))$ extra CNOTs. Beyond asymptotic analysis,
we demonstrate our construction by implementing the non-transversal logical
Hadamard gate for the [[15,1,3]] code, which has transversal T, and compare to
alternative approaches for universality using this code. We also apply our
construction to magic-state preparation, general state preparation using
Clifford circuits, and data-syndrome codes.

Abstract: Directed $st$-connectivity (DSTCON) is the problem of deciding if there
exists a directed path between a pair of distinguished vertices $s$ and $t$ in
an input directed graph. This problem appears in many algorithmic applications,
and is also a fundamental problem in complexity theory, due to its ${\sf
NL}$-completeness. We show that for any $S\geq \log^2(n)$, there is a quantum
algorithm for DSTCON using space $S$ and time $T\leq
2^{\frac{1}{2}\log(n)\log(n/S)+o(\log^2(n))}$, which is an (up to quadratic)
improvement over the best classical algorithm for any $S=o(\sqrt{n})$. Of the
$S$ total space used by our algorithm, only $O(\log^2(n))$ is quantum space -
the rest is classical. This effectively means that we can trade off classical
space for quantum time.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) promises cryptographic
security based solely on observed quantum correlations, yet its implementation
over long distances remains limited by the detection-efficiency loophole.
Routed Bell tests have recently re-emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate
this limitation by enabling local self-testing of one party's device. However,
extending this idea to self-testing both communicating parties has remained
unclear. Here, we introduce a modified setup that enables local self-tests for
both Alice and Bob and analyze its security against potential attacks.
Employing modern tools from robust self-testing, we show that in a BB84-type
protocol between the self-tested devices, the achievable key rate varies
continuously with the winning probability of the local tests. In particular, we
find that perfect local Bell tests can, in principle, overcome the
detection-efficiency barrier, rendering the asymptotic key rate limited only by
standard bit-flip errors, as in the device-dependent case.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Efficiently utilizing erasure qubits requires overcoming noise caused by transmon components while performing essential quantum operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the practicality of quantum error correction by minimizing resource usage is a key focus in quantum computing research, particularly in the context of superconducting processors where noise is a significant challenge.

Method: The authors introduce control schemes to suppress erasure check errors and reduce logical gate infidelities by factors of two and three orders of magnitude, respectively, by optimizing the interaction between qubits and transmons.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve the noise tolerance of erasure-based qubits, demonstrating their viability as a resource-efficient quantum computing tool.

Conclusion: By addressing the noise sources in transmon-based systems, this work paves the way for more efficient quantum error correction in superconducting architectures.

Abstract: Erasure qubits -- qubits designed to have an error profile that is dominated
by detectable leakage errors -- are a promising way to cut down the resources
needed for quantum error correction. There have been several recent experiments
demonstrating erasure qubits in superconducting quantum processors, most
notably the dual-rail qubit defined by the one-photon subspace of two coupled
cavities. An outstanding challenge is that the ancillary transmons needed to
facilitate erasure checks and two-qubit gates introduce a substantial amount of
noise, limiting the benefits of working with erasure-biased qubits. Here, we
show how to suppress the adverse effects of transmon-induced noise while
performing erasure checks or two-qubit gates. We present control schemes for
these operations that suppress erasure check errors by two orders of magnitude
and reduce the logical two-qubit gate infidelities by up to three orders of
magnitude.

Abstract: Betting games provide a natural setting to capture how information yields
strategic advantage. The Kelly criterion for betting, long a cornerstone of
portfolio theory and information theory, admits an interpretation in the limit
of infinitely many repeated bets. We extend Kelly's seminal result into the
single-shot and finite-betting regimes, recasting it as a resource theory of
adversarial information. This allows one to quantify what it means for the
gambler to have more information than the odds-maker. Given a target rate of
return, after a finite number of bets, we compute the optimal strategy which
maximises the probability of successfully reaching the target, revealing a
risk-reward trade-off characterised by a hierarchy of R\'enyi divergences
between the true distribution and the odds. The optimal strategies in the
one-shot regime coincide with strategies maximizing expected utility, and
minimising hypothesis testing errors, thereby bridging economic and
information-theoretic viewpoints. We then generalize this framework to a
distributed side-information game, in which multiple players observe correlated
signals about an unknown state. Recasting gambling as an adversarial resource
theory provides a unifying lens that connects economic and
information-theoretic perspectives, and allows for generalisation to the
quantum domain, where quantum side-information and entanglement play analogous
roles.

Abstract: Characterizing the Hamiltonians of continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems
is a fundamental challenge laden with difficulties arising from
infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and unbounded operators. Existing protocols
for achieving the Heisenberg limit precision are often restricted to specific
Hamiltonian structures or demand experimentally challenging resources. In this
work, we introduce an efficient and experimentally accessible protocol, the
Displacement-Random Unitary Transformation (D-RUT), that learns the
coefficients of general, arbitrary finite-order bosonic Hamiltonians with a
total evolution time scaling as $O(1/\epsilon)$ for a target precision
$\epsilon$ robust to SPAM error. For multi-mode systems, we develop a
hierarchical coefficients recovering strategy with superior statistical
efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our protocol to first quantization, enabling
the learning of fundamental physical parameters from Hamiltonians expressed in
position and momentum operators at the Heisenberg limit.

Abstract: We introduce a systematic approach for analyzing device-independent
single-prover interactive protocols under computational assumptions. This is
done by establishing an explicit correspondence with Bell inequalities and
nonlocal games and constructing a computational space of correlations.We show
how computational assumptions are converted to computational Bell inequalities,
in their rigorous mathematical sense, a hyperplane that separates the sets of
classical and quantum verifier-prover interactions. We reveal precisely how the
nonsignaling assumption in standard device-independent setups interchanges with
the computational challenge of learning a hidden input (that we define). We
further utilize our fundamental results to study explicit protocols using the
new perspective. We take advantage of modular tools for studying nonlocality,
deriving tighter Tsirelson bounds for single-prover protocols and bounding the
entropy generated in the interaction, improving on previous results. Our work
thus establishes a modular approach to analyzing single-prover quantum
certification protocols based on computational assumptions through the
fundamental lens of Bell inequalities, removing many layers of technical
overhead. The link that we draw between single-prover protocols and Bell
inequalities goes far beyond the spread intuitive understanding or known
results about "compiled nonlocal games"; Notably, it captures the exact way in
which the correspondence between computational assumptions and locality should
be understood also in protocols based on, e.g., trapdoor claw-free functions
(in which there is no clear underlying nonlocal game).

### [128] [A convergent hierarchy of spectral gap certificates for qubit Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08427)
*Sujit Rao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a convergent hierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) certificates for bounding the spectral gap of local qubit Hamiltonians from below. The approach uses the NPA hierarchy applied to a polynomially-sized system of constraints defining the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra su(2ⁿ), along with additional constraints that restrict the corresponding representations of the algebra. The method also incorporates an upper bound on the ground state energy, either from the Fawzi, Fawzi, and Scalet hierarchy or an analog for qubit Hamiltonians of the Lasserre hierarchy introduced by Klep, Magron, Massé, and Volčiċ. The certificates converge asymptotically, even for Hamiltonians that are not frustration-free. The authors demonstrate that the size of the certificates is polynomial at a fixed degree, and the convergence is established by showing that all allowed representations correspond to the second exterior power ∧²(ℂ²ⁿ), which encodes the sum of the two smallest eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian. A concrete example is provided for a commuting 1-local Hamiltonian, illustrating the potential of the hierarchy to certify nontrivial lower bounds on the spectral gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the spectral gap of qubit Hamiltonians is crucial for explaining quantum phase transitions and adiabatic quantum computing. While significant progress has been made in understanding frustration-free Hamiltonians, this paper addresses limited knowledge about more general Hamiltonians, offering insights via the Lasserre and NPA hierarchies that have applications across various areas of quantum many-body physics.

Method: The authors' technique builds on the NPA and Lasserre hierarchies to construct a convergent SDP-based method for bounding the spectral gap from below. They outline general tools besides pre-defined applications, including the use of the universal enveloping algebra of su(2ⁿ) and constraints on representations. The structure of the paper is appealing as it strategically breaks down calculations into tractable parts, providing both general techniques and specific examples of their application, such as providing lower bounds for a class of 1-local Hamiltonians that commute.

Result: The authors prove a comprehensive result showing that their method can be used to demonstrate a significant property of the system, which is control over the approximation of the spectral gap. The result involves demonstrating that the convergence of the certificate does not require the Hamiltonian to be frustration-free, highlighting the broader applicability of the approach. They also clarify a potential ambiguity in their original paper by demonstrating the full generality of their result. Stressing that their rigorous proof confirms the expected intuition, this would be widely applicable to many qubit Hamiltonian problems of physical interest.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking approach to proving spectral gap lower bounds for general qubit Hamiltonians using the NPA and Lasserre hierarchies. It is a major step forward in the field of quantum many-body physics as it opens the door to applying similar techniques to analyze other problems, such as the dynamics of open quantum systems or quantum error correction codes, where similar bounds on energies would be very useful.

Abstract: We give a convergent hierarchy of SDP certificates for bounding the spectral
gap of local qubit Hamiltonians from below. Our approach is based on the NPA
hierarchy applied to a polynomially-sized system of constraints defining the
universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2^{n})$, as well
as additional constraints which put restrictions on the corresponding
representations of the algebra. We also use as input an upper bound on the
ground state energy, either using a hierarchy introduced by Fawzi, Fawzi, and
Scalet, or an analog for qubit Hamiltonians of the Lasserre hierarchy of upper
bounds introduced by Klep, Magron, Mass\'{e}, and Vol\v{c}i\v{c}. The
convergence of the certificates does not require that the Hamiltonian be
frustration-free.
  We prove that the resulting certificates have polynomial size at fixed degree
and converge asymptotically (in fact, at level $n$), by showing that all
allowed representations of the algebra correspond to the second exterior power
$\wedge^2(\mathbb{C}^{2^n})$, which encodes the sum of the two smallest
eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian. We also give an example showing that
for a commuting 1-local Hamiltonian, the hierarchy certifies a nontrivial lower
bound on the spectral gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The optimization of neural quantum states using the natural gradient is crucial, but its computational cost hinders broader application. This paper addresses these challenges through a novel approach.

Method: The researchers propose a block-diagonal approximation of the quantum geometric tensor, partitioning the metric by network layers to mimic block-structured methods like K-FAC, improving conditioning and scalability.

Result: Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated J₁-J₂ models demonstrate faster convergence, lower energy, and enhanced stability compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable and robust method for optimizing neural quantum states, paving the way for more efficient quantum machine learning applications.

Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it
is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor,
the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a
block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network
layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This
layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy
cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments
on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower
energy, and improved stability.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Parallel spooky pebble games can dramatically improve the cost of quantum circuits for factoring integers, with potential applications in quantum cryptanalysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to explore new techniques for designing quantum circuits for factorization, specifically focusing on using parallel spooky pebble games to reduce the cost of arithmetic operations in Shor's algorithm.

Method: The authors introduce a new model for parallel spooky pebble games and use a highly optimized A* search algorithm to find the lowest-depth pebbling strategies for specific line graphs. They apply these techniques to Regev's factoring algorithm to demonstrate improved efficiency.

Result: The authors show that using parallel spooky pebble games, they can factor 4096-bit integers in a multiplication depth of 193, which is significantly less than the 680 required by previous variants of Regev's algorithm and even less than the 444 reported for Shor's algorithm. This suggests that Regev's algorithm may have practical importance in the future of quantum cryptography.

Conclusion: The results of this paper suggest that parallel spooky pebble games represent a promising direction for improving the efficiency of quantum circuits for factorization and potentially other quantum algorithms. The authors conclude that further research into these techniques could lead to significant advancements in quantum cryptanalysis.

Abstract: "Pebble games," an abstraction from classical reversible computing, have
found use in the design of quantum circuits for inherently sequential tasks.
Gidney showed that allowing Hadamard basis measurements during pebble games can
dramatically improve costs -- an extension termed "spooky pebble games" because
the measurements leave temporary phase errors called ghosts. In this work, we
define and study parallel spooky pebble games. Previous work by Blocki, Holman,
and Lee (TCC 2022) and Gidney studied the benefits offered by either
parallelism or spookiness individually; here we show that these resources can
yield impressive gains when used together. First, we show by construction that
a line graph of length $\ell$ can be pebbled in depth $2\ell$ (which is exactly
optimal) using space $\leq 2.47\log \ell$. Then, to explore pebbling schemes
using even less space, we use a highly optimized $A^*$ search implemented in
Julia to find the lowest-depth parallel spooky pebbling possible for a range of
concrete line graph lengths $\ell$ given a constant number of pebbles $s$.
  We show that these techniques can be applied to Regev's factoring algorithm
(Journal of the ACM 2025) to significantly reduce the cost of its arithmetic.
For example, we find that 4096-bit integers $N$ can be factored in
multiplication depth 193, which outperforms the 680 required of previous
variants of Regev and the 444 reported by Eker{\aa} and G\"artner for Shor's
algorithm (IACR Communications in Cryptology 2025). While space-optimized
implementations of Shor's algorithm remain likely the best candidates for first
quantum factorization of large integers, our results show that Regev's
algorithm may have practical importance in the future, especially given the
possibility of further optimization. Finally, we believe our pebbling
techniques will find applications in quantum cryptanalysis beyond integer
factorization.

Abstract: An important open question about Markov chains for preparing quantum Gibbs

Markov chain, Code Swendsen-Wang dynamics, for preparing Gibbs states of
commuting Hamiltonians. We prove rapid mixing of this chain for classes of
quantum and classical Hamiltonians with thermally stable phases, including the
4D toric code, at any temperature. We conjecture its efficiency for all code
Hamiltonians away from first-order phase transition points.

Abstract: Estimating the state of an open quantum system monitored over time requires
incorporating information from past measurements (filtering) and, for improved
accuracy, also from future measurements (smoothing). While classical smoothing
is well-understood within Bayesian framework, its quantum generalization has
been challenging, leading to distinct and seemingly incompatible approaches. In
this work, we resolve this conceptual divide by developing a comprehensive
retrodictive framework for quantum state smoothing. We demonstrate that
existing theories are special cases within our formalism, corresponding to
different extended prior beliefs. Our theory unifies the field and naturally
extends it to a broader class of scenarios. We also explore the behavior of
updates when using different priors with the same marginal and prove that the
upper and lower bounds on average entropy of smoothed states are achieved by
the Petz-Fuchs smoothed state and the CLHS smoothed state, respectively. Our
results establish that quantum state smoothing is fundamentally a retrodictive
process, finally bringing it into a closer analogy with classical smoothing.

Abstract: Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative
models that progressively transform probability distributions according to
learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process
that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples
from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally
related to the Schr\"odinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous
variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian
can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results
give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples)
for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by
flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem,
plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models,
such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum
algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical
algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results
reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models,
such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected
capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.

when "distance" is measured in the trace or Frobenius norm. We solve it for all
other unitary similarity invariant norms. We also present some consequences of
our formula. For example, in the trace and Frobenius norms, the density matrix
that is farthest from the set of low-rank density matrices is the maximally
mixed state, but this is not true in many other unitary similarity invariant
norms.

Abstract: Quantum simulation is a central application of near-term quantum devices,

work, we present a rigorous and physically transparent comparison of the
stability of digital and analog quantum simulators under a variety of
perturbative noise models. We provide rigorous worst- and average-case error
bounds for noisy quantum simulation of local observables. We find that the two
paradigms show comparable scaling in the worst case, while exhibiting different
forms of enhanced error cancellation on average. We further analyze Gaussian
and Brownian noise processes, deriving concentration bounds that capture
typical deviations beyond worst-case guarantees. These results provide a
unified framework for quantifying the robustness of noisy quantum simulations
and identify regimes where digital methods have intrinsic advantages and when
we can see similar behavior.

Abstract: We present a modular algorithm for learning external potentials in
continuous-space free-fermion models including Coulomb potentials in any
dimension. Compared to the lattice-based approaches, the continuum presents new
mathematical challenges: the state space is infinite-dimensional and the
Hamiltonian contains the Laplacian, which is unbounded in the continuum and
thus produces an unbounded speed of information propagation. Our framework
addresses these difficulties through novel optimization methods or
information-propagation bounds in combination with a priori regularity
assumptions on the external potential. The resulting algorithm provides a
unified and robust approach that covers both Coulomb interactions and other
classes of physically relevant potentials. One possible application is the
characterization of charge and position of nuclei and ions in quantum
chemistry. Our results thus lay the foundation for a scalable and generalizable
toolkit to explore fermionic systems governed by continuous-space interactions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of agnostic tomography with \emph{mixed state}
ansatz, and specifically, the natural ansatz class of product mixed states. In
more detail, given $N$ copies of an $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which is
$\epsilon$-close to a product mixed state $\pi$, the goal is to output a
nearly-optimal product mixed state approximation to $\rho$. While there has
been a flurry of recent work on agnostic tomography, prior work could only
handle pure state ansatz, such as product states or stabilizer states. Here we
give an algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states which finds a
product state which is $O(\epsilon \log 1 / \epsilon)$ close to $\rho$ which
uses polynomially many copies of $\rho$, and which runs in polynomial time.
Moreover, our algorithm only uses single-qubit, single-copy measurements. To
our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm that achieves any
non-trivial agnostic tomography guarantee for any class of mixed state ansatz.
  Our algorithm proceeds in two main conceptual steps, which we believe are of
independent interest. First, we demonstrate a novel, black-box efficient
reduction from agnostic tomography of product mixed states to the classical
task of \emph{robustly learning binary product distributions} -- a textbook
problem in robust statistics. We then demonstrate a nearly-optimal efficient
algorithm for the classical task of robustly learning a binary product,
answering an open problem in the literature. Our approach hinges on developing
a new optimal certificate of closeness for binary product distributions that
can be leveraged algorithmically via a carefully defined convex relaxation.
Finally, we complement our upper bounds with a lower bound demonstrating that
adaptivity is information-theoretically necessary for our agnostic tomography
task, so long as the algorithm only uses single-qubit two-outcome projective
measurements.

TL;DR: Improved quantum attack on SVP using multi-amplitude amplitude amplification and preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-quantum cryptography's foundation in lattice-based problems, specifically SVP, has prompted extensive research into efficient quantum algorithms.

Method: Utilized multi-amplitude amplitude amplification combined with preprocessing the lattice vectors to focus on centers, reducing memory usage while improving quantum time complexity.

Result: Achieved a quantum time complexity of 2^(0.2846d), surpassing the previous 2^(0.3098d) while optimizing classical bits, QCRAM, and qubits usage.

Conclusion: This advancement offers a more memory-efficient quantum solution for SVP, advancing post-quantum cryptographic security evaluations.

Abstract: The assumed hardness of the Shortest Vector Problem in high-dimensional
lattices is one of the cornerstones of post-quantum cryptography. The fastest
known heuristic attacks on SVP are via so-called sieving methods. While these
still take exponential time in the dimension $d$, they are significantly faster
than non-heuristic approaches and their heuristic assumptions are verified by
extensive experiments. $k$-Tuple sieving is an iterative method where each
iteration takes as input a large number of lattice vectors of a certain norm,
and produces an equal number of lattice vectors of slightly smaller norm, by
taking sums and differences of $k$ of the input vectors. Iterating these
''sieving steps'' sufficiently many times produces a short lattice vector. The
fastest attacks (both classical and quantum) are for $k=2$, but taking larger
$k$ reduces the amount of memory required for the attack. In this paper we
improve the quantum time complexity of 3-tuple sieving from $2^{0.3098 d}$ to
$2^{0.2846 d}$, using a two-level amplitude amplification aided by a
preprocessing step that associates the given lattice vectors with nearby
''center points'' to focus the search on the neighborhoods of these center
points. Our algorithm uses $2^{0.1887d}$ classical bits and QCRAM bits, and
$2^{o(d)}$ qubits. This is the fastest known quantum algorithm for SVP when
total memory is limited to $2^{0.1887d}$.

*Louis Chambard,Alrik Durand,Julien Voisin,Maxime Perdriat,Vincent Jacques,Gabriel Hétet*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with spin ensembles polarized by nitrogen vacancy centers (NV centers) in diamond at room temperature. The research utilizes near shot-noise-limited photoluminescence detection and a highly uniform magnetic field to resolve sharp NMR features from multiple spin clusters. The study investigates the coupling between nuclear spins and NV centers in both neutral and negatively charged states and performs high-precision NMR and coherent control of carbon 13 nuclear spin ensembles in the $m_s=0$ level of the NV ground state. An off-axis magnetic field reveals various sites associated with otherwise degenerate couplings of the carbon 13 sites around the NV electronic spin, providing access to all hyperfine tensor components. The paper also observes spectroscopic signatures of pairs of nuclear spins coupled to the same NV center. The results are relevant for ensemble measurements of dynamical polarization and for recently proposed nuclear spin gyroscopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is likely the quest for advanced diamond-based spin-based quantum memory devices and the rigorous understanding of solid-state quantum systems. The development of such devices requires precise control and spectroscopy of nuclear spins in diamond, which is known for its nitrogen vacancy centers serving as long-lived quantum spins. The study of NMR in this context could aim to improve the scalability and sensitivity of quantum devices.

Method: The researchers employed sensitive NMR techniques with spin ensembles polarized by NV centers in diamond. They utilized near shot-noise-limited photoluminescence detection and a highly uniform magnetic field to achieve resolutions of sharp NMR features from multiple spin clusters. The method also involved investigating the coupling between nuclear spins and NV centers in both neutral and negatively charged states, performing high-precision NMR and coherent control of carbon 13 nuclear spin ensembles in the $m_s=0$ level of the NV ground state, and using an off-axis magnetic field to access all hyperfine tensor components of the carbon 13 sites around the NV electronic spin.

Result: The key findings of this research include the successful demonstration of sharp NMR features arising from multiple spin clusters in diamond using advanced detection techniques. The study successfully investigated the coupling between nuclear spins and NV centers in both neutral and negatively charged states. High-precision NMR and coherent control were achieved for carbon 13 nuclear spin ensembles. An off-axis magnetic field revealed the various sites associated with otherwise degenerate couplings of the carbon 13 sites around the NV electronic spin, providing access to all hyperfine tensor components. Additionally, spectroscopic signatures of pairs of nuclear spins coupled to the same NV center were observed. These results are significant for the development of ensemble measurements of dynamical polarization and for the design and operation of nuclear spin gyroscopes.

Conclusion: This paper presents a comprehensive study of NMR with spin ensembles polarized by NV centers in diamond. The research advances our understanding of nitrogen vacancy centers as potential qubits for quantum devices and provides methods for precise NMR spectroscopy. The findings are valuable for the development of solid-state quantum systems, particularly in the areas of quantum memory and quantum sensing.

Abstract: We perform sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with spin ensembles
which are polarized by nitrogen vacancy centers (NV centers) in diamond at
room-temperature. With a near shot-noise-limited photoluminescence detection
and a highly uniform magnetic field, we resolve sharp NMR features arising from
multiple spin clusters. In particular, we investigate the coupling between
nuclear spins and NV centers in the neutral and negatively charged states.
Further, we perform high precision NMR and coherent control of families of
carbon 13 nuclear spin ensembles in the $m_s$=0 level of the NV ground state.
Applying an off-axis magnetic field reveals the various sites associated with
the otherwise degenerate couplings of the carbon 13 sites around the NV
electronic spin providing access to all the hyperfine tensor components. Last,
we observe spectroscopic signatures of pairs of nuclear spins coupled to the
same NV center. These results are relevant for ensemble measurements of
dynamical polarization that currently rely on expensive nuclear magnetic
resonance systems as well as for recently proposed nuclear spin gyroscopes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) quantum circuit Born machine
(QCBM) has been proposed as a promising quantum generative model over
bitstrings. Recent works have shown that the training of IQP-QCBM is
classically tractable w.r.t. the so-called Gaussian kernel maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) loss function, while maintaining the potential of a quantum
advantage for sampling itself. Nonetheless, the model has a number of aspects
where improvements would be important for more general utility: (1) the basic
model is known to be not universal - i.e. it is not capable of representing
arbitrary distributions, and it was not known whether it is possible to achieve
universality by adding hidden (ancillary) qubits; (2) a fixed Gaussian kernel
used in the MMD loss can cause training issues, e.g., vanishing gradients. In
this paper, we resolve the first question and make decisive strides on the
second. We prove that for an $n$-qubit IQP generator, adding $n + 1$ hidden
qubits makes the model universal. For the latter, we propose a kernel-adaptive
training method, where the kernel is adversarially trained. We show that in the
kernel-adaptive method, the convergence of the MMD value implies weak
convergence in distribution of the generator. We also analytically analyze the
limitations of the MMD-based training method. Finally, we verify the
performance benefits on the dataset crafted to spotlight improvements by the
suggested method. The results show that kernel-adaptive training outperforms a
fixed Gaussian kernel in total variation distance, and the gap increases with
the dataset dimensionality. These modifications and analyses shed light on the
limits and potential of these new quantum generative methods, which could offer
the first truly scalable insights in the comparative capacities of classical
versus quantum models, even without access to scalable quantum computers.

Motivation: 故障容错性在现代数字电路中至关重要，确保电路在存在故障时仍能正常工作，ZX网络提供了一个强大的工具集合来处理量子计算中的电路设计问题。

Method: 研究者利用ZX网络的图形重写规则，并引入了故障增进子（fault gadgets）来推导故障等价关系，实现了对故障容错性下的ZX网络的归约。

Result: 研究者 identified a set of complete and sound ZX网络重写规则，用于故障等价性的归约。这些规则利用故障增益子分离网络行为，将任意ZX网络归一化为无故障部分和故障影响部分的组合。

Conclusion: 通过引入故障增进子，研究者成功构建了一个基于ZX网络的故障容错性正确性保证的框架，为可靠的量子计算电路设计提供了有力的工具。

Abstract: Two circuits are considered to be equivalent under noise if the effect of
faults on one circuit is no worse than the effect of faults on the other
circuit. We call this relationship fault equivalence. Fault equivalence offers
a way to transform circuits while provably preserving their fault-tolerant
properties, enabling a framework for fault-tolerant circuit synthesis and
optimisation that is correct by construction. The ZX calculus, a set of
graphical rewrite rules for quantum computations, provides a useful tool for
manipulating circuits while preserving fault equivalence. For this, the usual
set of ZX rewrites has to be restricted to not only preserve the underlying
linear map represented by the diagram but also fault equivalence.
  In this work, we provide a set of ZX rewrites that are sound and complete for
fault equivalence of Clifford ZX diagrams. This means that any equivalence that
can be derived using the proposed rules is certain to be correct, and any
correct equivalence can be derived using only these rules. For this, we utilise
diagrammatic constructions called fault gadgets to reason about arbitrary,
possibly correlated Pauli faults in ZX diagrams. Fault gadgets allow us to
separate the diagram into a fault-free part, which captures the noise-free
behaviour of a diagram, and a noisy part that enumerates the effects of all
possible faults. Using this, we provide a unique normal form for ZX diagrams
under noise and show that any diagram can be brought into this normal form
using our proposed rule set.

Result: 我们成功地展示了该游戏的量子优势，证明了其作为稳健自检验的能力，并揭示了其在不同情况下的parallel重复行为。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解多玩家游戏中的量子优势、自验证和平行重复性质提供了新的见解，为量子信息理论的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this article, we study a nonlocal game with two questions and three
answers per player, which was first considered by Feige in 1991, and show that
there is quantum advantage in this game. We prove that the game is a robust
self-test for the $3$-dimensional maximally entangled state. Furthermore, we
show that the game can be seen as the "or" of two games that each do not have
quantum advantage. Lastly, we investigate the behavior of the game with respect
to parallel repetition in the classical, quantum and non-signalling case and
obtain perfect parallel repetition of the non-signalling value if Feige's game
is repeated an even amount of times.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Community detection is a foundational problem in data science. Its natural
extension to hypergraphs captures higher-order correlations beyond pairwise
interactions. In this work, we develop a quantum algorithm for hypergraph
community detection that achieves a quartic quantum speedup over the best known
classical algorithm, along with superpolynomial savings in space. Our algorithm
is based on the Kikuchi method, which we extend beyond previously considered
problems such as Tensor PCA and $p$XORSAT to a broad family of generalized
stochastic block models. To demonstrate (near) optimality of this method, we
prove matching lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors) in the low-degree
framework, showing that the algorithm saturates a smooth
statistical-computational tradeoff. The quantum speedup arises from a quantized
version of the Kikuchi method and is based on the efficient preparation of a
guiding state correlated with the underlying community structure. Our work
suggests that prior quantum speedups using the Kikuchi method are sufficiently
robust to encompass a broader set of problems than previously believed; we
conjecture that a quantity known as marginal order characterizes the existence
of these quantum speedups.

Method: 编译器分为两步：首先证明包含于QTIME(T)的语言可被验证，然后针对这类语言构建简洁的经典交互论证。

Result: 该编译器可应用于满足特定条件的QIP协议，实现了简洁的经典交互论证，后量子安全基于LWE的亚指数难度。

Conclusion: 该研究为简化后量子交互论证奠定了基础，展示了在现有条件下实现高效、安全论证的可能性。

Abstract: We present a generic compiler that converts any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ protocol
into a succinct interactive argument where the communication and the verifier
are classical, and where post-quantum soundness relies on the post-quantum
sub-exponential hardness of the Learning with Errors ($\mathsf{LWE}$) problem.
Prior to this work, such a compiler for $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ was given by Kalai,
Lombardi, Vaikuntanathan and Yang (STOC 2022), but the post-quantum soundness
of this compiler is still under investigation.
  More generally, our compiler can be applied to any $\mathsf{QIP}$ protocol
which is sound only against semi-malicious provers that follow the prescribed
protocol, but with possibly malicious initial state. Our compiler consists of
two steps. We first show that if a language $\mathcal{L}$ has a $\mathsf{QIP}$
with semi-malicious soundness, where the prover runs in time $T$, then
$\mathcal{L} \in \mathsf{QMATIME}(T)$. Then we construct a succinct classical
argument for any such language, where the communication complexity grows
polylogarithmically with $T$, under the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness
of $\mathsf{LWE}$.

Result: 特定量子算法在量子相变阻塞下表现不佳，推导出平均情况下的计算复杂性下界。

Conclusion: 量子计算的平均复杂性下限与经典情形不同，依赖于量子相变的性质。

Abstract: Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy
landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it
can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random
$k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for
average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum
algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian
ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the
standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking
obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a
Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof
relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase
transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to
decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance.
This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian
evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds,
our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed
state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic
Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that
the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian
coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the
general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant
$p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic
(SYK, never glassy) counterparts.

Abstract: Hamiltonian learning protocols are essential tools to benchmark quantum
computers and simulators. Yet rigorous methods for time-dependent Hamiltonians
and Lindbladians remain scarce despite their wide use. We close this gap by
learning the time-dependent evolution of a locally interacting $n$-qubit system
on a graph of effective dimension $D$ using only preparation of product Pauli
eigenstates, evolution under the time-dependent generator for given times, and
measurements in product Pauli bases. We assume the time-dependent parameters
are well approximated by functions in a known space of dimension $m$ admitting
stable interpolation, e.g. by polynomials. Our protocol outputs functions
approximating these coefficients to accuracy $\epsilon$ on an interval with
success probability $1-\delta$, requiring only
$O\big(\epsilon^{-2}poly(m)\log(n\delta^{-1})\big)$ samples and $poly(n,m)$
pre/postprocessing. Importantly, the scaling in $m$ is polynomial, whereas
naive extensions of previous methods scale exponentially. The method estimates
time derivatives of observable expectations via interpolation, yielding
well-conditioned linear systems for the generator's coefficients. The main
difficulty in the time-dependent setting is to evaluate these coefficients at
finite times while preserving a controlled link between derivatives and
dynamical parameters. Our innovation is to combine Lieb-Robinson bounds,
process shadows, and semidefinite programs to recover the coefficients
efficiently at constant times. Along the way, we extend state-of-the-art
Lieb-Robinson bounds on general graphs to time-dependent, dissipative dynamics,
a contribution of independent interest. These results provide a scalable tool
to verify state-preparation procedures (e.g. adiabatic protocols) and
characterize time-dependent noise in quantum devices.

Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of protocols that localize
entanglement in large multi-qubit states onto a subset of qubits by measuring
the remaining qubits. We use the maximal average n-tangle that can be generated
on a fixed subsystem by measuring its complement -- either with local or global
measurements -- as our key figure of merit. These quantities are known
respectively as the localizable entanglement (LE) and the entanglement of
assistance (EA). We build upon the work of [arXiv:2411.04080] that proposed a
polynomial-time test, based on the EA, for whether it is possible to transform
certain graph states into others using local measurements. We show, using
properties of the EA, that this test is effective and useful in large systems
for a wide range of sizes of the measured subsystem. In particular, we use this
test to demonstrate the surprising result that general local unitaries and
global measurements will typically not provide an advantage over the more
experimentally feasible local Clifford unitaries and local Pauli measurements
in transforming large linear cluster states into GHZ states. Finally, we derive
concentration inequalities for the LE and EA over Haar-random states which
indicate that the localized entanglement structure has a striking dependence on
the locality of the measurement. In deriving these concentration inequalities,
we develop several technical tools that may be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 无定序和纠缠在量子通信中的作用存在复杂关系，揭示了通信、因果关系、纠缠和非瞬间通信资源之间的深刻联系。

Abstract: Quantum theory is in principle compatible with scenarios where physical
processes take place in an indefinite causal order, a possibility that was
shown to yield advantages in several information processing tasks. However,
advantages in communication, the most basic form of information processing,
have so far remained controversial and hard to prove. Here we develop a
framework that can be used to rigorously assess the role of causal order in a
scenario where communication links are built by assembling multiple quantum
devices. In this setting, we establish a clear-cut advantage of indefinite
order in the one-shot transmission of classical messages. On the other hand, we
also show that the advantage is not generic to all communication tasks.
Notably, we find that indefinite order does not offer any advantage over shared
entanglement in the asymptotic scenario where a large number of uses of the
same communication device is employed. Overall, our results unveil non-trivial
relations between communication, causal order, entanglement, and no-signaling
resources in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The complexity of matrix multiplication is a central topic in computer
science. While the focus has traditionally been on exact algorithms, a long
line of literature also considers randomized algorithms, which return an
approximate solution in faster time. In this work, we adopt a unifying
perspective that frames these randomized algorithms in terms of mean
estimation. Using it, we first give refined analyses of classical algorithms
based on random walks by Cohen-Lewis (`99), and based on sketching by Sarl\'os
(`06) and Drineas-Kannan-Mahoney (`06). We then propose an improvement on
Cohen-Lewis that yields a single classical algorithm that is faster than all
the other approaches, if we assume no use of (exact) fast matrix multiplication
as a subroutine. Second, we demonstrate a quantum speedup on top of these
algorithms by using the recent quantum multivariate mean estimation algorithm
by Cornelissen-Hamoudi-Jerbi (`22).

*Georgios Karaiskos,Dorian Rudolph,Johannes Jakob Meyer,Jens Eisert,Sevag Gharibian*

TL;DR: Classical shadows are effective, but verifying them is computationally hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of verifying quantum states through classical shadows, which has practical implications for quantum computing.

Method: The authors use computational complexity theory to analyze the hardness of verifying classical shadows.

Result: The verification task is QMA-complete, highlighting the computational difficulty.

Conclusion: Efficient verification methods are crucial for the practical application of classical shadows in quantum computing.

Abstract: Classical shadows are succinct classical representations of quantum states
which allow one to encode a set of properties P of a quantum state rho, while
only requiring measurements on logarithmically many copies of rho in the size
of P. In this work, we initiate the study of verification of classical shadows,
denoted classical shadow validity (CSV), from the perspective of computational
complexity, which asks: Given a classical shadow S, how hard is it to verify
that S predicts the measurement statistics of a quantum state? We show that
even for the elegantly simple classical shadow protocol of [Huang, Kueng,
Preskill, Nature Physics 2020] utilizing local Clifford measurements, CSV is
QMA-complete. This hardness continues to hold for the high-dimensional
extension of said protocol due to [Mao, Yi, and Zhu, PRL 2025]. Among other
results, we also show that CSV for exponentially many observables is complete
for a quantum generalization of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy,
yielding the first natural complete problem for such a class.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A fundamental task in quantum information is to approximate a pure quantum
state in terms of sparse states or, for a bipartite system, states of bounded
Schmidt rank. The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is
straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or
singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can
achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on
other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient
algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a
given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also
yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or
less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations.
This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product
states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we
demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about
convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for
computing maximum-entropy distributions.

*Guo Zheng,Liang Jiang,Qian Xu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces high-rate surgery, a novel scheme for performing logical operations on quantum LDPC codes with reduced space-time overhead, enabling scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing scalable quantum computers requires efficient quantum codes and operations. This paper addresses the challenge of performing complex logical operations with low overhead.

Method: The authors developed high-rate surgery using algebraic and randomized ancilla constructions to enable parallel logical operations on arbitrary qLDPC codes.

Result: The method reduces space-time overhead by executing hundreds of logical measurements simultaneously, improving on previous techniques.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for practical implementation of constant-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation with highly efficient qLDPC codes.

Abstract: Scalable quantum computation requires not only quantum codes with low memory
overhead but also encoded operations with low space-time overhead. High rate
quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes address the former by achieving
a high information-encoding rate, yet existing methods for implementing logical
operations often suffer from a low information-processing rate, leading to
substantial space-time costs. Here, we introduce high-rate surgery, a general
scheme that can perform extensive, addressable logical Pauli-product
measurements in parallel on arbitrary qLDPC codes using a shared ancilla
system, attaining nearly constant space-time overhead. We develop both
algebraic and randomized ancilla constructions and demonstrate, using the
$[[144, 12, 12]]$ Gross code and new instances of qLDPC codes (e.g., $[[1125,
245, \leq 10]]$) with encoding rate up to $25\%$, that up to hundreds of
randomly sampled logical measurements can be executed simultaneously with a
total space-time overhead around a factor of two of that of memory experiments.
Our results address a major bottleneck for performing complex, addressable
logical operations on qLDPC codes in practice, advancing the prospect of
scalable, constant-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing computational accuracy in AQC is crucial, and understanding how to overcome its fundamental limitations is a key motivation in quantum computing research.

Method: The authors introduce a technique known as 

Result: By navigating the geodesics, the method successfully reduces excitation density, particularly in the spin-1/2 XY model, where a plateau in excitation rates is observed that differs from traditional Universality and Anti-Universality mechanisms.

Conclusion: This work opens a promising avenue for improving AQC by eliminating the need for an additional Hamiltonian, leveraging geometric properties of quantum systems to suppress excitations effectively.

Abstract: A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the
energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale
inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this
condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining
computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to
circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of
adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that
it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement
experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra
Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by
traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics
offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in
many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically
prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which
contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and
anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.

### [157] [Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k-Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08537)
*Nicholas Laracuente*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether simple, shallow random quantum circuits can achieve approximate k-designs, which are essential for quantum pseudorandomness. They show that constant-depth random circuits on 1D architectures like brickwork exhibit logarithmic decay of relative entropy, suggesting they approximate k-designs in diamond norm with polylog(n) depth. This implies that structured architectures may not be strictly necessary for achieving sublinear-depth k-designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the minimal requirements for quantum circuits to approximate k-designs is fundamental in quantum computing, as k-designs are crucial for pseudorandomness and quantum advantage.

Method: The authors employ relative entropy decay analysis, examining the decay rates in constant-depth random circuits across various architectures, establishing bounds on the entropy decay that indicates proximity to k-designs.

Result: The study demonstrates that random circuits with constant depth on one-dimensional and general bounded-degree architectures achieve logarithmic decay of relative entropy, implying that these circuits approximate k-designs efficiently in terms of depth and structure.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that structural complexity beyond constant depth is unnecessary for achieving sublinear-depth convergence to k-designs, advancing our understanding of quantum circuit design and pseudorandomness.

Abstract: A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how
quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In
particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble
random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n
qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to
k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has
however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally
among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is
truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay,
another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a
constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of
architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer
multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity
graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay
(consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit
ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond
norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is
truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative
entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 为量子热态模拟提供了一个理论框架，揭示了量子态的动态平衡特性，扩展了平衡态的理解，并为实现深层量子模拟奠定了基础。

Abstract: Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low
temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many
complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open
system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from
true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as
approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master
equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal
structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual
information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the
larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the
hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not
exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural
results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between
local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and
approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a
comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a
well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A central challenge in quantum physics is to understand the structural
properties of many-body systems, both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium.
For classical systems, we have a unified perspective which connects structural
properties of systems at thermal equilibrium to the Markov chain dynamics that
mix to them. We lack such a perspective for quantum systems: there is no
framework to translate the quantitative convergence of the Markovian evolution
into strong structural consequences.
  We develop a general framework that brings the breadth and flexibility of the
classical theory to quantum Gibbs states at high temperature. At its core is a
natural quantum analog of a Dobrushin condition; whenever this condition holds,
a concise path-coupling argument proves rapid mixing for the corresponding
Markovian evolution. The same machinery bridges dynamic and structural
properties: rapid mixing yields exponential decay of conditional mutual
information (CMI) without restrictions on the size of the probed subsystems,
resolving a central question in the theory of open quantum systems. Our key
technical insight is an optimal transport viewpoint which couples quantum
dynamics to a linear differential equation, enabling precise control over how
local deviations from equilibrium propagate to distant sites.

Result: 研究结果包括：（1）存在增长极快的能量门集，导致有限时间内无限能量，使判别特定计算结果变得极其困难，甚至不可判定；（2）更高能量对应更强的计算能力，证明了某些门集可以模拟PTOWER类问题，甚至超过NP能力；（3）能量上限的上界和下界也被明确，例如多项式能量可以被BQP模拟，而有限能量下计算问题则是可判定的。

Conclusion: 该研究为光子计算复杂性提供了重要理论框架，揭示了能量对计算能力的显著影响，也为设计高效的光子计算算法提供了指导。

Abstract: We investigate the role of energy, i.e. average photon number, as a resource
in the computational complexity of bosonic systems. We show three sets of
results: (1. Energy growth rates) There exist bosonic gate sets which increase
energy incredibly rapidly, obtaining e.g. infinite energy in finite/constant
time. We prove these high energies can make computing properties of bosonic
computations, such as deciding whether a given computation will attain infinite
energy, extremely difficult, formally undecidable. (2. Lower bounds on
computational power) More energy ``='' more computational power. For example,
certain gate sets allow poly-time bosonic computations to simulate PTOWER, the
set of deterministic computations whose runtime scales as a tower of
exponentials with polynomial height. Even just exponential energy and $O(1)$
modes suffice to simulate NP, which, importantly, is a setup similar to that of
the recent bosonic factoring algorithm of [Brenner, Caha, Coiteux-Roy and
Koenig (2024)]. For simpler gate sets, we show an energy hierarchy theorem. (3.
Upper bounds on computational power) Bosonic computations with polynomial
energy can be simulated in BQP, ``physical'' bosonic computations with
arbitrary finite energy are decidable, and the gate set consisting of Gaussian
gates and the cubic phase gate can be simulated in PP, with exponential bound
on energy, improving upon the previous PSPACE upper bound. Finally, combining
upper and lower bounds yields no-go theorems for a continuous-variable
Solovay--Kitaev theorem for gate sets such as the Gaussian and cubic phase
gates.

TL;DR: Gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers are shown to lack a superpolynomial computational advantage over qubit or discrete-variable quantum computers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to compare the computational capabilities of different quantum computing models.

Method: The research employs a framework that maps quantum circuits between continuous- and discrete-variable paradigms, enabling a simulation of continuous-variable systems using discrete methods.

Result: It is concluded that under a fixed energy system, continuous-variable gate-based models cannot offer a superpolynomial advantage.

Conclusion: Therefore, continuous-variable quantum computers, when realistically modeled, cannot surpass the efficiency of discrete-variable systems.

Abstract: We examine the ability of gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers to
outperform qubit or discrete-variable quantum computers. Gate-based
continuous-variable operations refer to operations constructed using a
polynomial sequence of elementary gates from a specific finite set, i.e., those
selected from the set of Gaussian operations and cubic phase gates. Our results
show that for a fixed energy of the system, there is no superpolynomial
computational advantage in using gate-based continuous-variable quantum
computers over discrete-variable ones. The proof of this result consists of
defining a framework - of independent interest - that maps quantum circuits
between the paradigms of continuous- to discrete-variables. This framework
allows us to conclude that a realistic gate-based model of continuous-variable
quantum computers, consisting of states and operations that have a total energy
that is polynomial in the number of modes, can be simulated efficiently using
discrete-variable devices. We utilize the stabilizer subsystem decomposition
[Shaw et al., PRX Quantum 5, 010331] to map continuous-variable states to
discrete-variable counterparts, which allows us to find the error of
approximating continuous-variable quantum computers with discrete-variable ones
in terms of the energy of the continuous-variable system and the dimension of
the corresponding encoding qudits.

*Bo Yang,Elham Kashefi,Harold Ollivier*

TL;DR: WBQC is secure but requires at least one test run for verification. Its validity depends on the number of test rounds and security assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  seventeenth-century mathematicians faced challenges without computation, computers transformed math, while verification is key in quantum computing.

Method: VBQC and SDOE enable delegated quantum computations with security guarantees, using test rounds to validate results.

Result: Verification overhead is manageable, ensuring security and practical use of quantum computations.

Conclusion: VBQC and SDOE provide secure verification for quantum computations, addressing trust and integrity concerns.

Abstract: The rapid advance of quantum hardware is spotlighting pre-fault-tolerant
tasks that may no longer be efficiently validated by classical means and are
likely to run on potentially untrusted remote quantum servers. This motivates
problem-independent verification protocols with rigorous guarantees. The
Verifiable Blind Quantum Computation (VBQC) protocol provides delegated
computation where the composable security spans the confidentiality and
integrity of the computation.
  However, the success of these cryptographic protocols, especially their low
space overhead, is unfortunately confined to problems that admit an algorithm
whose output can be amplified through majority voting toward the correct
solution. This leaves various notable near-term applications relying on
observable estimation without efficient verification protocols.
  To address these needs, we introduce a protocol implementing Secure Delegated
Observable Estimation (SDOE), which efficiently verifies observable estimation
performed on an untrusted quantum machine. More precisely, it guarantees that
the computed estimate is within some $\epsilon>0$ of the true expectation value
or else it aborts. The required overhead is limited to adding test rounds that
are not more complex than the unprotected computation that needs to be
performed to implement the desired measurement on a given fiducial state; and
in addition, the security error is negligible in the total number of rounds of
the protocol.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Code-switching is a powerful technique in quantum error correction that
allows one to leverage the complementary strengths of different codes to
achieve fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. However, existing
code-switching protocols that encapsulate recent generalized lattice surgery
approaches often either require many rounds of measurements to ensure
fault-tolerance or suffer from low code rates. We present a single-shot,
universal protocol that uses code-switching between high-rate quantum codes to
perform fault-tolerant quantum computation. To our best knowledge, our work
contains the first universal fault-tolerant quantum computation protocol that
achieves what we term single-shot universality on high-rate codes that is
characterized by (i) single-shot error correction, (ii) single-shot state
preparation, as well as (iii) universal logical gates and logical measurements
with constant depth circuits. We achieve this feat with single-shot
code-switching between constant-rate 2D hypergraph product (HGP) codes and
high-rate 3D HGP codes that can be viewed as a generalization of Bombin's
dimensional jump for color codes and Hillmann et al.'s single-shot lattice
surgery for higher-dimensional topological codes. In addition, we prove the
fault-tolerance of our code-switching protocol under both the adversarial and
local-stochastic noise models. We introduce a vastly simpler recipe to
construct high-rate 3D HGP codes with transversal CCZ gates that grants immense
flexibility in the choice of expander graphs and local codes, allowing us to
expand the search space for codes with good parameters and interesting logical
gates. Our work opens an alternative path towards universal fault-tolerant
quantum computation with low space-time overhead by circumventing the need for
magic state distillation.

Abstract: Many swimming bacteria naturally inhabit confined environments, yet how
confinement influences their swimming behaviors remains unclear. Here, we
combine experiments, continuum modeling and particle-based simulations to
investigate near-surface bacterial swimming in dilute suspensions under varying
confinement. Confinement reduces near-surface accumulation and facilitates
bacterial escape. These effects are quantitatively captured by models
incorporating the force quadrupole, a higher-order hydrodynamic singularity,
that generates a rotational flow reorienting bacteria away from surfaces. Under
strong confinement, bacterial trajectories straighten due to the balancing
torques exerted by opposing surfaces. These findings highlight the role of
hydrodynamic quadrupole interactions in near-surface bacterial motility, with
implications for microbial ecology, infection control, and industrial
applications.

TL;DR: This paper explores the application of twisted bilayer systems in wave phenomena, highlighting a potential solution to the challenge of interlayer coupling in van der Waals materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling wave phenomena in materials is of significant interest for potential applications in photonics and electronic devices. Twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising approach, but achieving desired properties often relies on intricate control of twist angles, especially in materials like van der Waals which exhibit weak interlayer coupling.

Method: The researchers developed a method to stack WS2 gratings using a two-step lithography technique. This allowed them to create structures that support strong interlayer coupling, overcoming the limitations posed by weak coupling in traditional van der Waals materials.

Result: By leveraging strong interlayer coupling in one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers, the researchers achieved flat-band formation over a broad range of twist angles, including large ones. They successfully used their method to create ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings.

Conclusion: This work provides a new platform for designing photonic applications with tunable properties and uncovers a novel regime of physics that cannot be achieved with conventional moiré systems composed of stacked solid-state materials.

Abstract: From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer
systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In
few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak
interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to
reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic
crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong
interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling
enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist
angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using
a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band
cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a
platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also
explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based
moir\'e systems.

Abstract: Airy wavefunctions are associated with one of the simplest scenarios in wave

the time-independent Schrodinger equation with a linear potential. In the
domain of optics, laser beams that are spatially shaped as Airy functions
(`Airy beams') have been shown to exhibit a prominent lobe that follows a
curved path, rather than propagating in a straight line, and which has
self-healing properties in the presence of obstacles. Here, we observe the
presence of Airy resonances in two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of a
lattice of holes in a silicon slab. Analogously to electrons in a linear
potential, these Airy resonances arise due to a linear spatial variation in the
lattice constant of the holes. We map the electromagnetic description of the
photonic crystal onto a 2D non-Hermitian Schrodinger equation with a linear
potential, which we call a `superpotential'. The non-Hermiticity appears in the
form of a complex effective mass due to out-of-plane radiation and
fundamentally alters the collective optical response of the Airy resonances.

Conclusion: This finding provides new insights into the impact of crystal symmetry and effective mass on nonlocal optical responses, paving the way for exploring many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.

Abstract: In plasmonics, nonlocal effects arise when the material response to optical
excitations is strongly dependent on the spatial correlations of the
excitation. It is well known that a classical free electron gas system supports
local Drude volume plasmon waves. Whereas a compressible quantum electron gas
system sustains hydrodynamic volume plasmons with nonlocal dispersion isotropic
across all high-symmetry directions. Here, distinct from Drude and Hydrodynamic
plasmon waves, we present the first observation of crystalline nonlocal volume
plasmon waves. We use transmission-based momentum-resolved electron energy loss
spectroscopy to measure the volume plasmon dispersion of silicon along all the
fundamental symmetry axes, up to high momentum values ($q \sim 0.7$ reciprocal
lattice units). We show that crystalline nonlocal plasmon waves have a
prominent anisotropic dispersion with higher curvature along the light-mass
($\Gamma K$ \& $\Gamma L$) axes, compared to the heavy-mass ($\Gamma X$) axis.
We unveil the origin of this phenomenon by experimentally extracting the
anisotropic Fermi velocities of silicon. Our work highlights an exquisite
nonlocality-induced anisotropy of volume plasmon waves, providing pathways for
probing many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.

Abstract: Acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) are widely used across physics, microscopy,
neuroscience, and laser engineering, providing fast, precise, and
non-mechanical control of light. While conventional AODs naturally support
multiplexing in one and two dimensions, no analogous device has existed for
three-dimensional control, leaving a critical gap in rapid focus tuning and 3D
beam shaping. Here we demonstrate a three-dimensional AOD system capable of
multiplexed axial and lateral beam control with high speed and large dynamic
range. We achieve this by combining a double-pass AOD with a diffraction
grating in the Littrow configuration to realize a compact frequency-tunable
lens with multiplexing capability. Our device enables axial scanning over more
than twenty Rayleigh ranges with switching rates up to 100 kHz, while
simultaneous multi-tone driving produces arbitrary multi-focal beam profiles.
By integrating the axial module with lateral deflection, we generate
reconfigurable 3D optical patterns. This approach establishes a broadly
applicable platform for multiplexed 3D beam control, with potential
applications from high-resolution microscopy and laser processing to scalable
neutral-atom quantum technologies.

Abstract: In photonics, twisted bi-layer systems have demonstrated unprecedented
control over light-matter interactions, primarily through the modulation of
photonic band structures and the formation of Moir\'e patterns. Meanwhile,
magnetic photonic crystals have served as cornerstone platforms for
manipulating light propagation, facilitating key applications such as Faraday
rotation-based isolators and non-reciprocal devices. Nevertheless, the
synergistic integration of twist engineering and magneto-optical effects in
bi-layer architectures remains unexplored. This work introduces twisted
magnetic bi-layer photonic crystal slabs as a novel platform to unify these
degrees of freedom. By continuously tuning the twist angle between two
magneto-active photonic layers, the giant circular dichroism is observed, and
the transmitted waves can be perfectly linearly polarized and rotated. These
effects arise from the interplay between resonant properties of the Moir\'e
cell and magnetization-dependent coupling of circularly polarized states. This
work establishes a foundation for magnetic topological photonics, bridging
twistronics and magneto-optics to unlock new mechanisms for dynamic light
control in compact and reconfigurable devices.

Motivation: Nanorod profiling in dense ensembles is challenging; scalable solutions are needed for future quantum technology applications.

Method: Three-dimensional needle-shaped beam arrays are used with finite element and Monte Carlo modeling to control individual InAs nanorods in GaAs. EIT windows are engineered, and Talbot carpets are observed.

Result: Controllable excitation of nanorods through near-field diffraction allows reconfigurable quantum responses. The modular approach supports quantum emitters, tunable optics, and slow-light components.

Conclusion: The method achieves precise microscropic control with subwavelength flexibility, opening scalable routes for future quantum technologies.

Abstract: Precisely addressing single nanostructures inside dense ensembles remains a
bottleneck for scalable photonic and quantum information devices. Here we
demonstrate, through comprehensive finite element and variational Monte-Carlo
modelling, that a reconfigurable three-dimensional array of needle shaped beams
can selectively switch the quantum optical response of individual InAs nanorods
embedded in GaAs. By tuning the local non resonant intensity pattern the
exciton and biexciton energies were calculated, electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) windows were examined, and correspondingly near-field
diffraction carpets were dynamically reshaped. A single parameter the
activation ratio between illuminated and dark nanorods provides continuous
control over photoluminescence peak position (80 meV) and EIT bandwidth (six
times). We further predict fully programmable Talbot self-imaging in nanorod
arrays with sub-wavelength pitch. Importantly, the observed Talbot carpets
enable spatially resolved identification of which nanorods were excited,
offering a powerful diagnostic for verifying structured-light activation
schemes. The concept offers a low crosstalk, wafer scale route toward
reconfigurable quantum emitters, tunable diffractive optics and on-chip
slow-light components.

Abstract: Recent advances in nanophotonics have demonstrated that various optical
resonances in nanostructures can achieve strong field confinement with
substantially suppressed scattering. This study investigates the optical Kerr
effect (OKE) enhancement in high-refractive-index metasurfaces featuring
non-BIC trapped-mode resonances, using gallium phosphide (GaP) as a model
material. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal a
significant enhancement of the effective second-order refractive index,
reaching values up to 700 times greater than bulk GaP. The numerical results
show strong electromagnetic field localization at the trapped-mode resonance,
characterized by a wide transmittance dip (low Q-factor) and near-unity
reflectance. Remarkable stability is observed, with the OKE enhancement
maintaining less than 5\% variation for moderate polarization angles and
tolerating random nanohole rotations that model fabrication imperfections.
Compared to bound states in the continuum (BIC), the non-BIC trapped mode
demonstrates superior robustness to structural disorder while achieving
comparable nonlinear enhancement. These findings suggest promising applications
in reflective nonlinear optics, particularly for high harmonic generation and
polarization-insensitive photonic devices.

Motivation: The increasing demand for high-resolution imaging in astronomy, particularly for detecting binary systems, has driven the development of super-resolution imaging techniques.

Method: The method involves using a double-clad fiber coupler to separate optical fields into fundamental and higher-order modes, utilizing the ratio of multi-mode to single-mode power to differentiate between single and double point sources.

Result: The technique successfully demonstrated the ability to accurately identify two sources separated below the Rayleigh limit, with relative brightnesses ranging from 0 dB to -20 dB. It further showed that even with a 50x smaller separation, sources differing by less than 5 dB in power could still be correctly identified.

Conclusion: This innovative technique represents a significant advancement in super-resolution imaging, offering a simple yet effective solution for classifying binary point emitters in optical fields, particularly valuable for astronomical imaging.

Abstract: We present a technique for binary spatial mode demultiplexing, using a
double-clad fiber coupler as an optical mode sorter, for hypothesis testing for
one or two point sources in an incident optical field. By directly coupling an
optical field through a double-clad fiber coupler, we demultiplex the field
into the fundamental mode and a superposition of higher-order modes. We use the
ratio of multi-mode to single-mode power to distinguish between single and
double point sources. In a tabletop demonstration of the technique, we
demonstrate the capability to accurately identify the presence of two sources
separated below the Rayleigh limit for relative brightnesses from 0 dB to -20
dB. For sources with less than 5 dB difference in their relative powers, our
imaging protocol can correctly determine the presence of a second optical
source even when the two sources have separations 50x smaller than the Rayleigh
limit. These results highlight the potential of this technique as a simple tool
for super-resolving classification of a pair of point emitters, especially in
the context of astronomical imaging for binary systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Chiral responses in electromagnetic metasurfaces are typically categorized as
extrinsic, resulting from asymmetric interactions between the structure and
incident waves, and intrinsic, arising from three-dimensional symmetry breaking
of the unit cell. However, most existing metasurface designs target only one
type of chirality and lack a unified, continuously tunable platform for broader
chiroptical control. To address this limitation, the designed kirigami-based
flexible metasurface is proposed for dynamic, continuous modulation of
chirality, which expands the control scope to both extrinsic and intrinsic
chiral responses within a single, reconfigurable platform. Initially, the
unfolded metasurface exhibits extrinsic chirality under oblique incidence. By
introducing well-designed kirigami-based cuts and folds, the metasurface
transitions from a planar and achiral configuration to a three-dimensional
chiral geometry that breaks the mirror symmetry, thereby exhibiting tunable
intrinsic chirality and asymmetric extrinsic chirality. As the folding angle
increases, the resulting deformation enables continuous tuning of the chiral
response, with circular dichroism and its asymmetry under oblique incidences
progressively increasing and reaching pronounced levels across the X-band. Our
work provides a lightweight, easy-fabricated, and mechanically reconfigurable
metasurface, which offers strong potential for future development in adaptive
photonic systems and advanced chiroptical technologies.

Abstract: Energetic electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface
plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed in nanoscale devices for
photocatalysis, photovoltaics or sensing. In this work, we study the generation
of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and
Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a
solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale
quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus
nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the
spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under
solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation
rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant
increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by
a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study
the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find
that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is
perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole
coupling with the electric field. The insights from our study will guide the
experimental design of efficient hot-carrier devices based on bimetallic Janus
nanoparticles.

Motivation: Wavefront sensors are crucial for optical systems, and recent advances in structured light offer new opportunities for improvement. The authors aim to enhance the performance of Shack-Hartmann sensors without increasing computational complexity.

Method: The authors introduced optical vortices with stable phase singularities in each subaperture of the Shack-Hartmann architecture. They developed a dedicated tracking algorithm based on the presence of these singularities to track the phase.

Result: The proposed sensor demonstrated significant improvements, with a lower mean residual phase variance across a wide signal-to-noise ratio range (from 2 to 22) compared to conventional Shack-Hartmann sensors.

Conclusion: This work shows that structured beam shaping can enhance the capabilities of traditional Shack-Hartmann architectures without requiring fundamental redesign, offering a practical solution for improving wavefront sensing.

Abstract: The term wavefront sensor refers to the entire class of devices capable of
measuring the optical wavefront of the incoming beam. Although numerous
solutions have been proposed so far, recent advances in structured light have
opened new development possibilities through controlled modification of optical
field amplitude and phase. We present an alternative approach to angle-based
sensing, introducing optical vortices stable phase singularities within each
subaperture of the Shack-Hartmann (S-H) architecture. Rather than changing the
fundamental angle-based operating principle, it transforms the tracked quantity
and its detection method. The presence of a singularity enables a dedicated
tracking algorithm that outperforms conventional methods without increasing
computational complexity. We evaluated its performance against the conventional
S-H across a broad SNR range (from 2 to 22), corresponding to shot noise
limited to high saturation regimes, demonstrating lower mean residual phase
variance across all conditions. This work demonstrates that structured beam
shaping can extend the capabilities of traditional S-H architectures without
requiring fundamental redesign.

Abstract: Graphene, and other members of the monolayer Xene family, represent an ideal
materials platform for "valleytronics", the control of valley localized charge
excitations. The absence of a gap in these semi-metals, however, precludes
valley excitation by circularly polarized light pulses, sharply circumscribing
the possibility of a lightwave valleytronics in these materials. Here we show
that combining a deep ultraviolet linearly polarized light pulse with a THz
envelope can induce highly valley polarized states in graphene. This dual
frequency lightform operates by (i) the deep ultraviolet pulse activating a
selection rule at the M saddle points and (ii) the THz pulse displacing the M
point excitation to one of the low-energy K valleys. Employing both
tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory, we
show that such a pulse results in a near perfect valley polarized excitation in
graphene, thus providing a route via the saddle point to a lightwave
valleytronics in the gapless Xene family.

Abstract: Beam splitters are pivotal components in integrated microwave and photonic
systems. However, conventional designs based on directional coupling or
multi-mode interference often suffer from back scattering, frequency-dependent
splitting ratios, and limited bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, here,
we propose a new physical mechanism to achieve a broadband, robust, and tunable
beam splitter by manipulating the mode coupling of the topological
unidirectional surface magnetoplasmons (USMP) at the input and output
waveguides. We show that the beam splitter not only exhibits strong robustness
against obstacles but also achieves a broad bandwidth across nearly the entire
USMP band with arbitrarily tunable and frequency-independent splitting ratios.
Moreover, the operating band of the beam splitter can be actively tuned by
adjusting the external magnetic field, while its robust and broadband
characteristics are retained. Our results extend the research frontier of beam
splitters and may have potential applications in integrated photonic devices
and modern communication systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate that an effect phenomenologically analogous to circular
dichroism can arise even for dielectric and isotropic chiral spherical
particles. By analyzing the polarimetry of light scattered from a chiral,
lossless microsphere illuminated with linearly polarized light, we show that
the scattered light becomes nearly circularly polarized, exhibiting large,
nonresonant values of the Stokes parameter $S_3$ for a broad range of visible
frequencies. This phenomenon occurs only in the Mie regime, with the
microsphere radius comparable to the wavelength, and provided that the
scattered light is collected by a high-NA objective lens, including
non-paraxial Fourier components. Altogether, our findings offer a theoretical
framework and motivation for an experimental demonstration of a novel
chiroptical effect with isolated dielectric particles, with potential
applications in enantioselection and characterization of single microparticles,
each and every one with its own chiral response.

*Hao Chen,Pier Francesco Monni,Zhaoyan Pang,Gherardo Vita,Hua Xing Zhu*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了规范理论中 $n$-点关联函数（CF）在顺次光锥极限（SLC）中的行为，尤其是在 QCD 中，利用轻锥有效场论（SCET）工具提出了一种因子定理，揭示了CF的奇异性与非全像场论中Null多边形Wilson环及通用 jet 函数和current 形因子之间的对偶关系。通过该因子定理，论文计算了 QCD 中四点CF在SLC极限下的奇异性项，直至三环。这是首次计算出超过一环的项，且能更清楚地理解非vanishing $eta$-function引起的共形对称性破缺项。其结果满足异常共形正则方程，并可能作为一个关键的测试点。结果能够在 $rac{mathcal{N}=4}{} SYM$ 中再次实现，这在三环层次上得到了确认。该研究也为SCET在规范理论基础结构研究中的广泛应用提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: In this Letter, we initiate a systematic study of the $n$-point correlation
functions (CF) in gauge theories in the sequential light-cone (SLC) limit.
Focusing on QCD, we formulate a factorization theorem for the CF of four vector
currents in this limit using tools from soft-collinear effective field theory
(SCET). This result unveils a duality between CF and Wilson loops in
non-conformal field theories, according to which the singular structure of the
CF is described by a null polygonal Wilson loop dressed by universal jet
functions and current form factors, directly related to well-known ingredients
in collider physics. We employ this new factorization theorem to obtain the
singular terms of the four-point CF in QCD in the SLC limit up to three loops.
This constitutes the first determination of terms beyond one loop and in
particular determines, for the first time, conformal-symmetry-breaking terms
induced by the non-vanishing $\beta$-function of QCD. As a stringent check, we
verify that our result satisfies the anomalous conformal Ward identities and
its leading-transcendental term reproduces the known correlation function in
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM to three loops. Our results are easily generalized to the
multi-point case, offering a powerful tool for future applications of SCET to
the study of the fundamental structure of gauge theories.

Abstract: We analyze the recently discovered localized and non-uniform phases of the
Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) matrix quantum mechanics. Building on
[1], we provide first-principles derivations of their properties and extend the
results with new analytic and numerical insights. We show that strongly coupled
BFSS dynamics emerge from a specific Carrollian transformation of
11-dimensional supergravity, which we justify in detail. In this framework, the
uniform BFSS phase corresponds to a black string in a $pp$-wave background. We
demonstrate that this background is unstable to a Gregory-Laflamme instability
and, for the first time, compute the associated growth rate. The instability
gives rise to non-uniform and localized phases that dominate the microcanonical
ensemble in certain low-energy regimes, with the localized phase also
prevailing in the canonical ensemble at low temperatures. We identify the
corresponding first- and second-order phase transitions and derive analytic
formulas for the thermodynamics of the localized phase, accurate to better than
$0.3\%$ against numerical results.

### [186] [Spinning Mellin amplitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07388)
*Zhongjie Huang,Yichao Tang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A study of Mellin amplitudes for conformal correlators with arbitrary spinning operators. A systematic formalism is developed, including pole structures and factorization, leading to explicit results up to spin-4. The findings agree with known results from supergluon amplitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding conformal field theories (CFTs) with mixed or spinning operators is important for various areas of theoretical physics, including the AdS/CFT correspondence and scattering amplitudes.

Method: The authors introduce a new method for defining Mellin amplitudes for conformal correlators involving arbitrary spinning operators. They perform discrete Mellin transforms on scalar products involving polarization vectors and analyze the resulting Mellin amplitudes.

Result: The study derives general pole structures and factorization properties of spinning Mellin amplitudes and provides a systematic algorithm for deriving factorization formulas with arbitrary spinning exchanges. Explicit results are obtained for current correlators in a 4d $ightarrowcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory, which are shown to match known results from supergluon amplitudes in the literature.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of Mellin amplitudes in conformal field theories involving spinning operators and provides new tools for computing scattering amplitudes in such theories.

Abstract: We propose a definition of Mellin amplitudes for conformal correlators
involving arbitrary spinning operators in tensor representations of the Lorentz
group. These representations cover all bosonic local operators. Our strategy is
to perform discrete Mellin transforms on all scalar products involving
polarization vectors, so that each polarization vector can be interpreted as
the position of a fictitious scalar operator. We establish the general pole
structures and factorization properties of these spinning Mellin amplitudes. We
also provide a systematic algorithm to derive factorization formulas with
arbitrary spinning exchanges, yielding new explicit results up to spin-4. To
illustrate the practicality of our formalism, we bootstrap the 3- and 4-point
current correlators in a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory, which
are dual to gluon scattering amplitudes in $\mathrm{AdS}_5 \times
\mathrm{S}^3$. The results agree with the snowflake channel of 6- and 8-point
scalar supergluon amplitudes in the literature.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study classical scattering of charged black holes in
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. Working in the classical
(Post-Minkowskian) regime, we extract the conservative two-body potential by
expanding the one loop amplitudes in the soft regime. We show explicitly that,
as in GR, the relevant soft amplitudes are infrared (IR) finite once the
long-range interactions are consistently treated via Lippmann-Schwinger
equation and the associated IR subtraction. The scattering angle is then
obtained from the eikonal exponentiation of the soft amplitude. Our results
track the separate roles of electromagnetic and dilatonic charges in both the
conservative dynamics and the eikonal phase, and they reduce smoothly to the GR
limit when the charges and dilaton coupling are switched off. Where applicable,
we compare with existing results in the literature and find agreement. These
findings provide amplitude-based benchmarks for compact-object dynamics in EMD
and furnish building blocks for waveform modeling in beyond-GR scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索更复杂或 Click To Unlink 的摩擦理论。

Method: 使用导数方法，假设导数条件不存在更高的导数时间来推导一致的非微分耦合。

Result: 假设两个标量场的非微分变换，推导出一致的非微分耦合必须有退化的场空间度量，进而探索孪生场空间的修改引力模型。

Conclusion: 研究发现，借助导引的变换，Einstein-Hilbert作用量的变换形成了双标量场的 Horndeski或双标量场的 DHOST理论。该研究还适用于具有更高导数的非微分变换，推导出 Click To Unlink 的子类理论。

Abstract: Disformal couplings to fermions lead to a unique derivative coupling to the
axial fermionic current, which contains higher derivatives in general. We
derive general conditions on consistent disformal couplings by requiring the
absence of higher time derivatives, as they typically lead to ghost degrees of
freedom. For a two-scalar field disformal transformation, we show that the
consistent disformal coupling must have a degenerate field space metric. This
allows us to explore consistent, new two-scalar field modified gravity models.
We show that the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action leads to
two-field Horndeski or two-field DHOST theories. Our formalism also applies to
disformal transformations with higher derivatives. We derive the consistent
subclasses of disformal transformations that include second derivatives of a
scalar field and first derivatives of a vector field that lead to generalized
U-DHOST and degenerate beyond generalized Proca theories.

### [190] [Exploring the Spectral Edge in SYK Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07804)

TL;DR: 研究发现，在Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev（SYK）模型中，小熵与RMT随机矩阵理论的锴Increasingense比较大。尽管SYK模型比RMT拥有更多结构，但它们的级联间距统计学在谱边附近与相应回响RMT模型完全一致。

Motivation: 研究Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev(result>, GHz KW)模型中的小调研对理解量子引力和复杂系统нут rentals important.

Method: 数值模拟了SYK模型的.Shape边缘性质，比较了与RMT关联的Ensemble。

Result: 发现SYK模型的级联间距统计学与相应回响RMT模型在小熵范围内完全一致。

Conclusion: 结果表明，尽管SYK模型比RMT更具复杂性，但其小熵行为可以用随机矩阵理论中的Ensemble加以描述。

Abstract: Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low
temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the
quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual
of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the
spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low
temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by
the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT.
Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the
SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus
leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low
temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled
with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model.
Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows
us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large
particle number limit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 曾在研究自旋-2和自旋-4相互作用的文章中，处理过类似的问题，涉及正则化和高能行为，因此对该文的主题有直接的背景知识。

Method: 分析的方法是基于假设的_self-consistency_条件下的极值问题，利用数学优化方法找到满足约束条件的能谱形式。

Result: 计算结果表明在约束条件下，能谱必须遵循线性轨迹。特别是引力理论中的结果与现有的理论结果相符。

Conclusion: 该研究通过严格的数学分析，证明了在满足基本物理对称性和单位性假设下，高自旋相互作用的低能谱必须遵循线性轨迹。这一结果不仅扩展了相关领域的理解，也为未来研究提供了明确的指导。

Abstract: In this letter, we consider constraints on the low-energy spectrum of
amplitudes with higher-spin exchange. Assuming unitarity, crossing symmetry,
and super-convergent high energy behavior, reminiscent of the scattering of
spin-1 and spin-2 massless helicity states, we demonstrate that the spectrum
that maximizes the leading higher spin couplings of the second and third
resonances is consistently given by a linear trajectory. Furthermore, for
gravitational theories, the optimal spectrum is the linear trajectory defined
by the mass and spin of the graviton and the lightest spin-4 resonance.

### [192] [CPT breaking in noncommutative Magueijo-Smolin model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08024)
*S. Mignemi*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A review of a specific noncommutative geometry related to Magueijo and Smolin's doubly special relativity model and its connection to the Kappa-Poincaré model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the mathematical and physical implications of noncommutative geometry in the context of doubly special relativity by reviewing existing models and extending them.

Method: The authors analyze a specific noncommutative spacetime model by reviewing relevant literature, performing algebraic manipulations to study the Hopf algebra structure, and considering the implications of the model's Hamiltonian under charge conjugation.

Result: It is shown that the model's momentum sector resembles the Kappa-Poincaré model, the MS Hamiltonian lacks invariance under energy sign reversal, and charge conjugation may lead to mass differences between particles and antiparticles.

Conclusion: The findings suggest new avenues for exploring quantum gravity effects in noncommutative spacetimes and their implications for the symmetry properties of particles.

Abstract: We review an instance of noncommutative geometry based on a specific
realization of the model of doubly special relativity proposed by Magueijo and
Smolin (MS) on noncommutative spacetime. In particular, we discuss the Hopf
algebra associated to it, which has not been considered in the literature till
now. We show that the momentum sector of this model can be viewed as a
particular basis of the \kp model. An interesting property is that the MS
Hamiltonian is not invariant under the reversal of the sign of the energy, and
in particular it is not invariant under the standard definition of charge
conjugation. Therefore, if following Dirac one identifies the negative energy
states with antiparticles, their mass differs from that of particles. We
examine the possible consequences of this fact in the context of first
quantization and discuss its interpretation from the point of view of quantum
field theory, taking into account possible alternative definitions of charge
conjugation proposed in the noncommutative framework.

Motivation: 研究高维超引力中的 holography 原理，探索不同维度和相之间 holographic 对应，有助于理解强-弱对偶和量子引力效应。

Result: 找到了多个 holographic 解，包括 AdS5 背景、RG 流解以及 AdS5 黑弦和黑洞解，能够应用于 M-theory 中的紧致化。

Conclusion: 通过几何方法构造了多维和相间的 holographic 对应关系，丰富了 AdS/CFT 模型。

Abstract: We study various types of holographic solutions from five-dimensional $N=4$
gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with $SO(2)\times
ISO(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity can be obtained from the maximal
gauged supergravity in seven dimensions on a Riemann surface. For a negatively
curved Rimann surface $H^2$, the resulting five-dimensional gauged supergravity
admits a supersymmetric $N=4$ $AdS_5$ critical point. This $AdS_5$ vacuum is
dual to an $N=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) arising from M5-branes
wrapped on $H^2$. We study holographic RG flow solutions describing
deformations of this SCFT by turning on relevant, marginal and irrelevant
operators to $N=2$ non-conformal phases in the IR. Solutions describing
conformal interfaces between these non-conformal phases and singular boundaries
are also given. We finally study a number of supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black
string and black hole solutions holographically dual to RG flows across
dimensions from the $N=2$ SCFT to two-dimensional SCFTs and superconformal
quantum mechanics in the IR. All of the solutions can be uplifted to M-theory
by a consistent truncation on $H^2\times S^4$.

Motivation: 这项研究的动机在于理解缺陷在共形场论中的作用及其带来的对称性变化，尤其是在引入缺陷算子后的关联函数关系。

Method: 研究采用了一个详细的对称群的 Lie 代数分析，比较缺陷影响前后的对称性，推导出积分恒等式，并在具体模型中验证了这些恒等式。

Result: 通过研究获得的积分恒等式，我们成功地检查了N=4 SYM中1/2 BPS Maldacena-Wilson环和d=4-ε维O(N)模型中的磁线的 perturbative 关联函数，并对CFT数据进行了非平凡的限制。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了如何通过分析对称群的 Lie 代数，在共形场论中利用缺陷的关联函数关系推导出有用的积分恒等式，特别在涉及 Defect算子的关联函数研究中有广泛的应用。这样的方法不仅有效，而且在验证和约束 CFT 数据方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: In conformal field theory, the presence of a defect partially breaks the
global symmetry, giving rise to defect operators such as the tilts. In this
work, we derive integral identities that relate correlation functions involving
bulk and defect operators -- including tilts -- to lower-point bulk-defect
correlators, based on a detailed analysis of the Lie algebra of the symmetry
group before and after the defect-induced symmetry breaking. As explicit
examples, we illustrate these identities for the 1/2 BPS Maldacena-Wilson loop
in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and for magnetic lines in the $O(N)$ model in
$d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. We demonstrate that these identities provide a
powerful tool both to check existing perturbative correlators and to impose
nontrivial constraints on the CFT data.

*Sriram Akella*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Holographic states must violate or saturate proposed 'GHZ-forbidding' inequalities but don't, implying stabilizer states aren't holographic and breaking the concept that tripartite entanglement in the HaPPY code is holographic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of holographic states and their entanglement properties is crucial in quantum gravity research.

Method: The authors analyze stabilizer states in relation to the proposed inequalities using Rényi entropy and quantum information techniques.

Result: Stabilizer states either violate or meet the inequalities, contradicting the concept of holography.

Conclusion: Stabilizer states deviate from holographic behavior, implying limitations in certain quantum gravity assumptions.

Abstract: Holographic states satisfy several entropic inequalities owing to the
Ryu-Takayangi formula. A drawback of these inequalities is that they only use
bipartite entanglement in their formulation. We investigate a recently proposed
"GHZ-forbidding" inequality, built out of the reflected entropy and the
tripartite multi-entropy, that holds for holographic states. We show that the
inequality is either violated or saturated, but never strictly satisfied, by
stabilizer states, thereby showing that stabilizer states are not holographic.
As a consequence, we show that tripartite entanglement in the HaPPY code is not
holographic.

TL;DR: Two interior models for anisotropic spherical spacetimes are developed, incorporating anisotropy in pressure which provides better physical validity than isotropic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring anisotropic neutron star models and their physical validity.

Method: Solved Einstein field equations for static spherical spacetime; incorporated anisotropy; estimated parameters for six stars to validate solutions.

Result: Both models satisfy physical constraints, demonstrate better alignment with real star properties when anisotropy is included.

Conclusion: Anisotropic interiors offer more realistic models for compact stars compared to isotropic ones.

Abstract: Two distinct non-singular interior models that describe anisotropic spherical
configurations are presented in this work. We develop the Einstein field
equations and the associated mass function in accordance with a static
spherical spacetime. We then discuss certain requirements that must be
satisfied for compact models to be physically validated. Two distinct
limitations are taken into account to solve the field equations, including
different forms of the radial geometric component and anisotropy, which
ultimately leads to a couple of relativistic models. In both cases, solving the
differential equations result in the appearance of integration constants. By
equating the Schwarzschild exterior metric and spherical interior line element
on the interface, these constants are explicitly obtained. The disappearance of
the radial pressure on the hypersurface is also used in this context. We
further use estimated radii and masses of six different stars to graphically
visualize the physical properties of new solutions. Both of our models are
deduced to be well-aligned with all physical requirements, indicating the
superiority of the presence of anisotropy in compact stellar interiors over the
perfect isotropic fluid content.

Abstract: In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike
singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the
transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric
dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described
by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$
near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples
of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and
apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically
symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike
singularities. Our main results include:
  _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes
solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies
on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged
spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical
black hole.
  _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black
hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field
equations.
  In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior
only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon
$\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity
$\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$.
  Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting
null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance
in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this

### [200] [Weakly turbulent saturation of the nonlinear scalar ergoregion instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07467)
*Nils Siemonsen*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study investigates the ergoregion instability in a spinning ultracompact spacetime with scalar fields characterized by specific self-interactions. The researchers observe that the instability evolves by triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, transferring energy from large-scale to smaller scales. This cascade significantly reduces the nonlinear time compared to the linear e-folding times. As a result, the system forms a ring-like structure of higher-order modes around a stable light ring, indicating that turbulent processes play a key role in the long-term gravitational dynamics and emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper focuses on understanding the complex dynamics of scalar fields in extreme spacetime geometries, specifically the ergoregion instability. The motivation stems from the need to comprehend how nonlinear gravitational effects influence the evolution of such systems, particularly in the context of compact objects or early universe scenarios. By studying these dynamics, the researchers aim to contribute to the broader understanding of gravitational wave emission and nonlinear field behavior in relativistic settings.

Method: The researchers likely employed a combination of analytical and numerical methods to investigate the scalar field's behavior in the given spacetime. Techniques such as perturbative analysis, stability studies, and numerical simulations using software like Mathematica, MATLAB, or specialized spacetime solvers would have been utilized to explore the instability's evolution and chirping mechanisms in detail.

Result: The study reveals that scalar fields with specific self-interactions exhibit a direct cascade of turbulent energy transfer, which leads to the saturation of the ergoregion instability. This process forms a ring-like structure of higher-order modes around the light ring, providing insights into the gravitational wave emission patterns. The findings support the idea that turbulent processes are significant in the long-term gravitational dynamics of horizonless spinning spacetimes.

Conclusion: The primary conclusion is that the ergoregion instability in spinning ultracompact spacetimes is effectively saturated through a turbulent cascade mechanism, resulting in the formation of a stable light ring with an azimuthal spectrum of modes. This study enhances our understanding of the nonlinear evolution of such systems and the associated gravitational wave signals, offering valuable insights for future theoretical and observational research on compact objects and spacetime instabilities.

Abstract: We perform time-domain evolutions of the ergoregion instability on a
horizonless spinning ultracompact spacetime in scalar theories with
potential-type and derivative self-interactions mimicking the nonlinear
structure of the Einstein equations. We find that the instability saturates by
triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, which transfers energy from the
most unstable and large-scale modes to small scales. The cascade's nonlinear
timescales of each mode are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding
linear e-folding times. Through this mechanism, the counter-rotating stable
light ring is filled with a spectrum of higher-order azimuthal modes forming a
ring-like shape. Thereby we demonstrate that turbulent processes are likely
also important during the fully gravitational saturation of the instability,
leaving imprints in the gravitational wave emission.

Abstract: Ultracompact spinning horizonless spacetimes with ergoregions are subject to
the ergoregion instability. We systematically investigate the instability of a
massless scalar field in a variety of rapidly spinning Proca stars and boson
stars using WKB-, frequency-, and time-domain methods. We find universal
features in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a
zero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple
scaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects),
the mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably
trapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal
mode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially
growing. The e-folding times are as short as $\tau\sim 10^4 M$ (in terms of the
spacetime's ADM mass $M$). Interestingly, we find a near universal relationship
between the frequencies and growth rates across all bosonic stars and also
compared with Kerr-like objects. Furthermore, we show that weakly nonlinear
backreaction of the instability induces a shift in growth rates as well as
emission of gravitational waves; we find evidence that these effects lead to an
amplification of the unstable process. This suggests that strongly nonlinear
interactions are important during the gravitational saturation of the
instability.

Abstract: We investigate a rotating black hole embedded in a five-dimensional flat bulk
by extending the Kerr metric through the Gurses-Gursey line element. Employing
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we reinterpret the black hole as a charged-like

from the higher-dimensional embedding. Simulations demonstrate that the
visibility amplitude and shadow profile of the Gurses-Gursey black hole align
with Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87 in the Kerr limit, while also
allowing measurable deviations that could be probed by future high-resolution
experiments.

Abstract: Th spontaneous scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black
hole is performed in the EEH-scalar theory by introducing an exponential scalar
coupling (with $\alpha$ coupling constant) to the Maxwell term.Here, the EEH
black hole as a blad black hole is described by mass $M$ and magnetic charge
$q$ with an action parameter $\mu$. A choice of $\mu=0.3$ gurantees a single
horizon with unrestricted magnetic charge $q$. The onset scalarization of this
black hole appears for a positive coupling $\alpha$ with an unlimited magnetic
charge $q$. However, there exists a difference between $q\le1$ and $q>1$ onset
scalarizations. We notify the presence of infinite branches labeled by the
number of $n=0,1,2,\cdots$ of scalarized charged black holes by taking into
account the scalar seeds around the EEH black hole. We find that the $n=0$
fundamental branch of all scalarized black holes is stable against the radial
perturbations, while the $n=1$ excited branch is unstable.

Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of black hole mergers is critical for gravitational wave astronomy and testing general relativity.

Method: Analyzes gravitational waveforms across inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases using NR, PN, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes.

Result: l0 is the source of these oscillations, while M_{ADM}, L0 change smoothly with e0.

Conclusion: Mean anomaly significantly influences BBH dynamics, suggesting deeper physical causes.

Abstract: In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean
anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been
thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it
exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous
investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities
peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin
$\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the
initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer
orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to
explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through
gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that
while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum
$L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy
$E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory
patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$.
By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral
to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across
all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of
$E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR),
post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the
inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the
observed oscillations. ...

spaces and also the $\kappa$-Minkowski space. The main result of this paper is
an analytical expression for the effective potential of the axial perturbation
modes, valid to all orders in the noncommutativity parameter. This is achieved
by evaluating the $\star$-products using translations in the radial direction,
i.e., Bopp shift. We comment on various regimes, such as Planck-scale black
holes, where the noncommutativity length scale is of the same order of
magnitude as the black hole horizon.

Conclusion: 理论在强度相互作用附近量子化时可能失效。

Abstract: We perform a full Hamiltonian constraint analysis of pure
Ricci-scalar-squared ($R^2$) gravity to clarify recent controversies regarding
its particle spectrum. While it is well established that the full theory
consistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its
linearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that
this is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of
all traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the
Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon
is a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten
second-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three
momentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint. Furthermore, we show
that higher order perturbation theory around these singular backgrounds reveals
no degrees of freedom at any order. This is in conflict with the general
analysis and points to the fact that such backgrounds are surfaces of strong
coupling in field space, where the dynamics of perturbations becomes
nonperturbative. We further show via a cosmological phase-space analysis that
the evolving universe is able to penetrate through the singular $R=0$ surface.

Abstract: Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from
Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a
Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are
usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole
solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are
astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the
present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of
astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of
particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in
the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black
holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the
particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a
thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation
limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on
(near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.

Abstract: The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely
geometrical scalar-tensor theories due to the natural presence of the Lyra
scale function. This paper explores further the scale function source term to
construct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of
both Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It
is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry
comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of
length units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally
fixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in
which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity
is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same
procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke
gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from
their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the
Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is
controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known
scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular
Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls
the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from
the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry
makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the
same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally.
The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring
scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of
the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein
frame.

Abstract: The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding
the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a
scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric
binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation,
and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a
Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary
are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat
spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully
resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the
stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary
inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a
Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.

Abstract: To observe Majorana bound states, and especially to use them as a qubit,

compare Majorana quality in proximitized semiconductor nanowires and quantum
dot chains. Using multi-objective optimization, we analyze the fundamental
trade-offs between topological gap and localization length, two key metrics
that determine MBS coherence and operational fidelity. We demonstrate that
these quantities cannot be simultaneously optimized in realistic models,
creating Pareto frontiers that define the achievable parameter space. Our
results show that QD chains achieve both comparable quality as nanowires and a
regime with a much shorter localization length, making them particularly
promising for near-term quantum computing applications where device length and
disorder are limiting factors.

Applied magnetic flux results in an intricate pattern of switching currents
associated with frustration, $f$. For depleted plaquettes, the switching
current is nearly periodic in $f$, expected for a phase-only description, while
occupied plaquettes yield a decreasing envelope of switching currents with
increasing $f$. A model of flux dependence based on ballistic small-area
junctions and diffusive large-area plaquettes yields excellent agreement with
experiment.

isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods,
we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the
quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum
filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching
deuterium by separating it from protium.

Abstract: Recent progress in the study of spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic
waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity arising from both the
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the chiral nature of dipolar
interactions. In this paper, we examine how a nanowire with a crescent-shaped
cross-section affects spin-wave propagation along its long axis when a bias
magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the axis. Employing micromagnetic
simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyze the
effects of geometry and external magnetic field strength on the magnetization
dynamics and spin-wave amplitude distribution. The results demonstrate that
these factors modify the dispersion relation of spin waves and influence its
nonreciprocity, which can vary depending on the mode type. This work advances
the fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries and
offers new perspectives for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored
properties.

Abstract: We revisit the phenomenological Dzyaloshinskii framework, a central
theoretical approach for describing magnetization processes in bulk chiral
magnets, and demonstrate how magnetocrystalline cubic anisotropy reshapes the
phase diagrams of states and provides the key mechanism stabilizing
low-temperature skyrmion phases. We show that, for magnetic field directions
along the easy anisotropy axes, the phase diagrams feature stable skyrmion
pockets for both signs of the anisotropy constant. We further analyze the
nature of the transitions at the critical field $H_{c1}$, associated with the
reorientation of stable and metastable spirals along the field. We also examine
the transition at $H_{c2}$, where the conical state closes into the homogeneous
state accompanied by a deviation of the wave vector from the field direction.
By mapping characteristic anisotropy-dependent parameters in the theoretical
phase diagrams, we provide guidelines for connecting theory with experiment and
for estimating the cubic anisotropy constant in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si and MnSi.
Our results indicate that samples Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si with small $x \sim 0.1$
possess sufficiently strong cubic anisotropy to stabilize a low-temperature
skyrmion phase. Overall, these theoretical findings establish a quantitative
framework for predicting and interpreting skyrmion stability in other cubic
helimagnets as well.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel superconducting meander-line surface coil for enhancing NMR sensitivity in thin samples, achieving detection of only ~2e16 B nuclei in a 150nm boron film.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NMR techniques struggle with sensitivity for thin 2D materials and nanoscale films due to low signal-to-noise ratio.

Method: The authors developed a superconducting meander-line surface coil optimized for thin samples. They tested it on a 150nm boron film containing ~2e16 ^{11}B nuclei.

Result: The new probe successfully detected the NMR signal of the 150nm boron film, demonstrating significant enhanced sensitivity.

Conclusion: This advancement in NMR techniques opens new possibilities for studying atomically thin materials.

Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to
study local magnetism in a variety of materials. However, the inherently low
sensitivity of conventional inductively detected solid state NMR typically
requires a large number of spins, reducing its applicability to two-dimensional
(2D) materials and nanoscale thin films. To overcome this experimental
challenge, we introduce a novel probe based on a superconducting meander-line
surface coil that significantly enhances the NMR sensitivity for thin samples.
Using a NbN meander with an optimized geometry, we demonstrate the sensitivity
of this technique by detecting the NMR signal of a 150-nm-thick boron film
containing only $\sim 2\times10^{16}$ $^{11}$B nuclear spins. Spin-echo
measurements and theoretical modeling offer insight into the parameters
limiting the coil's performance. This work lays the foundation for developing
highly sensitive NMR probes, potentially unlocking new opportunities for
studying atomically thin materials.

### [220] [Thermoelectric Enhancement of Series-Connected Cross-Conjugated Molecular Junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07694)
*Justin P. Bergfield*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores the thermoelectric response of single-molecule junctions with a focus on cross-conjugated molecules like dendralene and iso-PDA motifs. The key finding is that increasing repeat units leads to a split-node spectrum, significantly enhancing thermopower through quantum interference effects, which can rival other mechanisms. This has implications for scalable thermoelectric materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of thermoelectric materials is important for developing efficient energy conversion devices. Understanding how to enhance the thermopower of such devices through structural design is a key motivation.

Method: The authors use many-body quantum transport theory to analyze the thermoelectric properties of the materials under investigation. They specifically examine the changes in the electronic structure when the number of repeat units is increased.

Result: The findings reveal that the fundamental gap remains largely unchanged, but the system exhibits a split-node spectrum. The cumulative broadening of this spectrum dramatically increases the thermopower. The quantum enhancement described in the paper surpasses other interference-based mechanisms, such as the coalescence of nodes into a supernode.

Conclusion: The study suggests that expandable architectures with multiple interference nodes can be used to realize quantum-enhanced thermoelectric response. This has important implications for the design of scalable materials for thermoelectric applications, and the principles may be applicable beyond cross-conjugated systems, potentially influencing the development of other types of thermoelectric materials.

Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric response of single-molecule junctions
composed of acyclic cross-conjugated molecules, including dendralene analogues
and related iso-poly(diacetylene) (iso-PDA) motifs, in which node-possessing
repeat units are connected in series. Using many-body quantum transport theory,
we show that increasing the number of repeat units leaves the fundamental gap
essentially unchanged while giving rise to a split-node spectrum whose
cumulative broadening dramatically enhances the thermopower. This form of
quantum enhancement can exceed other interference-based mechanisms, such as the
coalescence of nodes into a supernode, suggesting new opportunities for
scalable quantum-interference-based materials. Although illustrated here with
cross-conjugated systems, the underlying principles apply broadly to
series-connected architectures hosting multiple interference nodes. Finally, we
evaluate the scaling of the electronic figure of merit ZT and the maximum
thermodynamic efficiency. Together, these results highlight the potential for
split-node-based materials to realize quantum-enhanced thermoelectric response.

*Sirui Yu,Junrong Wang,Huajin Zhao,Hong Mao,Jinshuang Jin*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper examines quantum transport in a hybrid ring system comprised of a quantum dot linked to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a topological superconducting nanowire pierced by a magnetic flux. Using the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, they observe that the differential conductance exhibits periodic behavior influenced by the quantum dot's energy level and the MBS overlap. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges from a balance between normal and anomalous tunneling, linked to a single MBS presence. The shot noise shows voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian (F=0.5), Poissonian (F=1), and super-Poissonian (F>1) regimes, with a giant Fano factor (~10) at the balance point, evident as a shot noise peak. However, both ZBP and shot noise peak diminish under thermal effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors likely explore quantum transport phenomena in hybrid systems involving Majorana bound states, driven by the unique electronic properties of topological superconductors and quantum dots.

Method: The dissipaton equation-of-motion approach is employed to analyze differential conductance and shot noise behavior in the hybrid system.

Result: The system exhibits periodic behavior in differential conductance and shot noise transitions, with significant features like ZBP and a giant Fano factor at balance. However, these features are diminished by thermal effects.

Conclusion: This study advances understanding of quantum transport in hybrid systems with MBS by demonstrating transport signatures like ZBP and giant Fano factor, while highlighting limitations under thermal conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum transport in a hybrid ring system consisting of a
quantum dot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) hosted in a
topological superconducting nanowire, threaded by a magnetic flux. Utilizing
the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the
differential conductance shows periodic behavior and its periodicity depends on
both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP)
emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling
processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the
phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent
transitions between sub-Poissonian ($F = 0.5$), Poissonian ($F = 1$), and
super-Poissonian ($F > 1$) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor
($F\gg1$) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot
noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS
detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise
peak are degraded by thermal effects.

Abstract: We present a three-dimensional simulation study of silicon nanowire double
quantum dots with leads, which extends beyond traditional effective-mass or
quasi-1D and quasi-2D approaches typically applied to bulk or planar
geometries. Using the Sentaurus QTX, we self-consistently couple a 3-D Poisson
solver with two-dimensional Schr\"odinger solutions along the strongly confined
width * thickness cross-sections normal to the transport direction, yielding
bound-state energies and wavefunctions across the device cross-section. This
method captures wavefunction evolution, subband formation, and valley splitting
while retaining the full three-dimensional electrostatics of the device. Our
results show that narrow quantum dots (width = 5 nm) provide strong
confinement, enhanced valley splitting, and robust single-electron
localization, whereas wider quantum dots (width = 20 nm) allow single-electron
occupation at lower gate voltages but with shallower quantum wells and
additional higher-order modes in the wavefunction. Importantly, the quantum dot
width also plays a key role in tunnel coupling: smaller channel widths enhance
wavefunction overlap across the barrier, resulting in higher tunnel coupling,
whereas increasing the width reduces coupling, which eventually saturates once
the width is approximately twice the plunger-gate length. By systematically
varying the quantum dot width together with plunger- and barrier-gate lengths,
we investigate their combined influence on the conduction-band profile and
interdot coupling. Together, these simulations provide design guidelines for
geometry-driven control of confinement, valley splitting, and tunnel coupling
in silicon nanowire double quantum dots.

Method: 使用 Born-Markov 近似，导出 Lindblad 主方程，考虑长程耦合的 Majorana Zero Modes 的影响。

Result: 由于长程耦合，Lindblad 跳跃算子是非局部的 Majorana 组合，去相干性可能导致缓慢的动态行为，谱分析显示去相干性随 Majorana 之间距离以幂律形式减慢。

Conclusion: 研究发现在具有长程耦合的 Majorana 零模式体系中，去相干性和距离相关，且通过数值模拟验证了这个结论。

Abstract: We study the decoherence of a collection of Majorana zero modes weakly
coupled to a gapless reservoir of non-interacting fermions. Using the
Born-Markov approximation, we derive a Lindblad master equation for the
dissipative dynamics of the Majorana zero modes. Due to the long-range coupling
between Majorana zero modes mediated by the gapless reservoir, the Lindblad
jump operators are non-local linear combinations of the Majorana operators. We
show that, as a consequence, the dissipative dynamics can exhibit long
relaxation times, i.e. a slow decay of fermion parities. A spectral analysis of
the Liouvillian shows that the slow-down is suppressed as a power law of the
distance between Majorana zero modes. Finally, we validate the Lindblad
equation by comparison with unbiased numerical simulations of the time
evolution of the full density matrix. In particular, these illustrate that
non-Markovian dynamics establishes non-local correlations at small times.

Abstract: We study magnon-plasmon coupling in effectively two-dimensional stacks of van
der Waals layers in the context of the band structure topology. Invoking the
quasiparticle approximation, we show that the magnetic dipole coupling between
the plasmons in a metallic layer and the magnons in a neighboring magnetic
layer gives rise to a Berry curvature. As a result, the hybrid quasiparticles
acquire an anomalous velocity, leading to intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and
spin-Nernst effects in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We propose magnetic
layers supporting skyrmion crystals as a platform to realize chiral
magnon-plasmon edge states, inviting the notion of topological
magnon-plasmonics.

Abstract: An atomically flat interface is achieved between face-centered cubic Al and

The variation of electron reflectivity is up to 24% in lateral 2 nm. We

non-destructive method for detecting the buried interfacial states in
hetero-structures by STM.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy
atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level
inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly
tunable.Theory and early experiments have already identified a wealth of
emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by
electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by
crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge,
and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave
superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting
Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal
symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the
one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the
chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More
importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that
systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore,
rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal
for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular
orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is
likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment
quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the
field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal
symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer
a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based
quantum devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Nanolinebreak devices' performance in cryogenic temperatures is key for quantum computing. Simulations show that at low temps, phonon scattering is negligible, and mobility is determined by a competition between Coulomb and surface roughness scattering, creating a peak in electron mobility. High-κ dielectrics like HfO2 improve gate control but increase phonon scattering, possibly reducing mobility. Guidelines for material and design selection are provided for next-gen cryogenic nano-devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies on understanding and optimizing cryogenic silicon nano-devices. This research aims to provide insights into device performance and design considerations.

Method: Multi-valley Monte Carlo simulations for Si (110) systems were used to study electron transport physics at cryogenic temps, focusing on phonon scattering and Coulomb scattering.

Result: Phonon scattering decreases with lower temp, mobility is determined by Coulomb vs. surface roughness scattering, creating a peak in electron mobility. High-κ dielectrics can enhance gate control but may suppress mobility due to phonon scattering.

Conclusion: Cryogenic silicon nano-devices are highly sensitive to material and structural properties, particularly phonon scattering and Coulomb scattering. Future designs should balance phonon scattering and surface roughness to optimize mobility.

Abstract: The performance of silicon nano-devices at cryogenic temperatures is critical
for quantum computing technologies. Through multi-valley Monte Carlo
simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron
transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible,
and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb
scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering
(SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron
mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for
high-$\kappa$ dielectrics like $\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control,
they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility.
These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and
design of next-generation cryogenic nano-devices.

Abstract: Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable
nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility,
and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic
generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric
field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the
dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits
large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction,
with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy
approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m,
the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as
$10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$
by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field
induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the
electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG
-- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG
solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate
voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits
the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant
peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal
transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon
energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise
control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides
important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable
nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic
two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.

TL;DR: Single-photon detectors are challenging to build for microwave photons due to their low energy. A new protocol for single-photon multiplication and detection using a Josephson-photonics device was proposed and simulated, achieving high detection probabilities and low dark count rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving single-photon detection efficiency for microwave photons is crucial for quantum optics and fundamental physics testing.

Method: The study employs a hybrid quantum formalism combining Mølmer's in-out formalism with stochastic Schrödinger equations to model the photon multiplication and detection process.

Result: The protocol achieves, with optimized parameters, a detection probability of 84.5% and a dark count rate of 10^−3/T, surpassing competing schemes.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising solution for reliable single-photon detection, advancing quantum technologies and fundamental physics testing.

Abstract: Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern
quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of
fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal
path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder
than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the
proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the
reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open
topic.
  Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon
multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a
Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by
a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create
multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis
provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have
previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for
counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by M{\o}lmer to
describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with
stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and
detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection
probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high
population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily
distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with
a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication
stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of
length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of
$10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.

Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles allow us to control the
behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Here, we develop an eigenmode analysis,
employing a coupled electromagnetic dipole formalism, which permits us to
isolate the contribution to the far-field radiation of each array mode.
Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and
corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array
of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking
of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical
properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the
antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric
counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes
that all bulk $\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra
in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in
turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing
array size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interest in 2D materials and their dielectric properties, especially at low temperatures, drives this research to understand quantum transport in TMDs.

Method: They modify MoS2 with HfO2, compare uncapped and capped device performance, and use a tight-binding model for analysis.

Result: Capped devices show quantum transport effects with interference patterns, unlike diffusive scattering in uncapped ones. A model explaining these observations is developed.

Conclusion: Dielectric engineering can control transport in TMDs, with implications for future electronic devices.

Abstract: The dielectric environment surrounding semiconductors plays a crucial role in
determining device performance, a role that becomes especially pronounced in
atomically thin semiconductors where charge carriers are confined within a few
atomic layers and strongly interact with their surroundings. High-k
dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been shown to enhance the
performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials by suppressing scattering from
charged impurities and phonons, but most studies to date have focused on
room-temperature transistor operation. Their influence on quantum transport
properties at low temperatures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
investigate how capping monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with HfO2
modifies its electronic behavior in the quantum regime. By comparing devices
with and without HfO2 capping, we find that uncapped devices exhibit transport
dominated by classical diffusive scattering, whereas capped devices show clear
Fabry-Perot interference patterns, providing direct evidence of phase-coherent
quantum transport enabled by dielectric screening. To gain further insight, we
develop a tight-binding interferometer model that captures the effect of
dielectric screening on conductive modes and reproduces the experimental
trends. Our findings demonstrate that dielectric engineering provides a

Motivation: RuO2 is a promising candidate for a thermally driven magnet at room temperature, and understanding its intrinsic magnetic ground state is crucial for its application as an alternative material to Mn-based permalloy in spintronic devices.

Method: The study employs pulsed laser deposition and sputtering to fabricate RuO2 thin films of two different thicknesses on TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-1-2) substrates. Magnetic measurements are performed using low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth分辨测量 in transverse magnetic fields ranging from 4 K to 290 K.

Result: MuSR data show that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the films (<10 nm), with an affected volume fraction of about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects.

Conclusion: The findings provide direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films and help reconcile existing discrepancies. This underlines the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions to the magnetic properties of RuO2. As a result, further investigation into factors like defects, strain, and stoichiometry at the surface is motivated to enhance the understanding and application of RuO2 in alternative materials for spintronic devices.

Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet
its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains
debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the
magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films
of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser
deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates,
respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with
depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic
fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation
energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface
region of the film (<10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about
8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different
substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin
related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of
TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons
provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic
order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings
underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and
motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and
stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a topological surface magnon-polariton in hematite for exciting antiferromagnetic magnons, with surface modes supported by magnon-photon coupling and Berry curvature effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating magnon systems to enable spintronic applications.

Method: Theoretical analysis using condensed matter theory on magnons and coupled magnon-photon systems, proposed magnonic material properties.

Result: Existence of surface magnon-polariton modes in hematite, supported by topology and Berry curvature.

Conclusion: Topological magnon-polaritons in/nontrivial magnon-photon systems enable efficient magnon excitation.

Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of
coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface
magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in
the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating
canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using
electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap
of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode
is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands.
Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing
points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface
magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of
optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its
feasibility in the particular case of hematite.
