We study a simple model for longitudinal magnons: a\nsquare lattice of spins $S$ coupled by the neareast-neighbor exchange, ferro-\nor antiferromagnetic, in the presence of a single-ion anisotropy. We calculate\nthe excitation spectra in the large-$D$ limit by using a strong-coupling\nexpansion. In the specific case of $S=1$ we compare the results for several\nanalytical approaches that include the linked-cluster expansion, the multiboson\nrepresentation of spin operators, and also, for a ferromagnetic ground state,\nthe exact solution of the two-particle bound states. Among these different\napproaches, the multiboson theory gives the decay rate of longitudinal magnons\nand describes the evolution of the excitation spectra from strong to moderate\nand weak anisotropy."}

It was the\nfirst such code to surpass the break-even point, thereby demonstrating the\npractical utility of quantum error correction. In this work, we propose a\nplanar fault-tolerant architecture for this code by concatenating it with the\nXZZX code via fusion-based error-correction. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first 2D nearest-neighbor architecture for fault-tolerant fusion-based\nerror-correction. We demonstrate how all the required operations, namely\nresource state preparation and Bell measurements, can be carried out using\nstandard circuit-QED techniques, such as intercavity beam-splitter coupling,\ncavity displacements, cavity-transmon dispersive coupling, and transmon drives.\nWe show analytically and numerically that all dominant hardware errors in the\nbosonic modes and control ancillae are corrected, to first-order, at the\nhardware level. Consequently, the outer XZZX code only needs to address smaller\nresidual errors, which are quadratically suppressed, effectively doubling the\narchitecture's fault-distance. Moreover, the performance of our architecture is\nnot limited by unwanted nonlinearities such as cavity self-Kerr, and it avoids\ndemanding coupling techniques like $\\chi$-matching or high-order coupling.\nOverall, our architecture substantially reduces the hardware complexity needed\nto achieve fault tolerance with the four-legged cat code."}

The systems of\nequations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but\nthey can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a\n1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that\ndetermines the coupling of the axion to the $\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}\\,\nF_{\\mu\\nu}\\, F_{\\rho\\sigma}$ term.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems,\ngoverned by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological\nedge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors,\nwe map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes\nthe band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly\ndissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a\ntopologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s\nrigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust\ndissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open\nfermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to\ngeneric quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and\nbounded spectrum for technical convenience. Our result establish a definitive\nboundary for the existence of robust topological phenomena in open fermionic\nsystems."}

Such a squeezed state is called the geometrically squeezed state.\nHowever, for interacting BECs with two-body collisions, a similar quench only\nresults in quantum fluctuations oscillating periodically without squeezing. In\nthis work, we identify superfluid stability as the key factor behind this\nnon-squeezing phenomenon, with the periodic oscillations arising from\ncollective excitations of a stable collective excitation mode. By strategically\nbreaking the stability criteria, we propose a dynamical approach for generating\nsqueezing that can exponentially suppress quantum fluctuations in a relatively\nshort time, surpassing the efficiency of existing experimental preparation\nschemes."}
