It has long been known that EPR at high magnetic fields offers greater spectral resolution, but limitations in the THz instrumentation have prevented the full realization of these opportunities. Here we describe an EPR spectrometer at the high magnetic field of 14 T using 396 GHz excitation, which adapts techniques from liquid-state NMR to obtain sharp EPR resonances with a width of 210 ppb (full-width half-maximum). We use this to measure resonance positions, and hence g-factors, with a precision that reaches $\\pm$16 ppb. Our use of in-situ liquid-state NMR of our solvent within the same sample improves the accuracy of these measurements: it allows us to reference our EPR measurement back to dilute gas 3He NMR for which quantum calculations are accurate. We measure the g-factor of N@C60 in deuterated toluene as g = 2.002 099 09 (3), where the 3 in brackets means that the uncertainty on the last digit is $\\pm$3."}

The system consists of a Cherenkov radiator layer separated from a photosensitive surface equipped with SiPMs by an expansion gap. A thin glass slab, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is coupled to the SiPMs to perform Cherenkov-based charged particle timing measurements. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM array sensors with pixel pitches ranging from 2 to 3 mm and coupled with 1 mm thick fused silica window. The RICH radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line with pions and protons. We measured a single-hit angular resolution of about 4 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value and a time resolution better than 50 ps RMS for charged particles with Z = 1. The present technology makes the proposed SiPM-based PID system particularly attractive for space applications due to the limited detector volumes available. In this work, we present beam test results obtained with the detector prototype and we discuss possible configurations optimized for the identification of ions in space applications."}

With the advent of cold-atom-based quantum and photonic technologies, several experiments and many proposals consider light propagation in one-dimensional optical lattices, using the transfer matrices as the main tool for the simulation. Here, we study the validity of this method by comparing its results to the microscopic coupled-dipole model, which is exact in the linear-optics regime. We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others. We determine the boundary values of atomic densities for which this method is still applicable for describing experiments. Our findings are relevant for experimental realizations using ultra-cold atoms."}

As epithelial cells tightly adhere together to form the confluent tissue, the distribution of cell areas significantly influences possible patterns of cellular packing and thereby also the mechanics of the epithelium. Therefore, it is important to understand the origin of cell area heterogeneity in developing tissues and, if possible, how to control it. Previous models of cell growth and division have been successful in accounting for experimentally observed area distributions in cultured cells and bacterial colonies, but developing tissues present additional complexity due to self-organized patterns of mechanical stresses that guide morphogenesis. Here, we address this challenge focusing on the D. melanogaster wing disc epithelium. We consider a simple model that couples cell cycle dynamics to tissue mechanics. From time-lapse imaging of the cellular network, we extract all model parameters - cell growth rates, division rates, and mechanical fluctuations - revealing that they all depend on cell size. With these independently measured parameters, our model quantitatively reproduces the observed cell area distribution without any fitting parameters and further predicts tissue pressure gradients, in quantitative agreement with previously published data. Importantly, we find that cell proliferation accounts for 85% of cell area variance, establishing it as the dominant source of packing disorder that influences tissue mechanics and organization."}

When the superconductors are deposited on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, this pattern is slightly modified due to the presence of chiral Majorana modes. Here we calculate the critical current of a Corbino Josephson junction, where the fluxoid becomes quantized and the superconducting phase has an integer winding. We discover that circular junctions exhibit similar behavior in both topologically trivial and non-trivial scenarios, while non-circular junctions demonstrate a remarkable distinction. Using a simple analytical model, we show that these non-circular junctions exhibit reentrant superconductivity with a period related to their number of corners, and numerically we find that this period is halved in the topological case. The period halving may help establish the existence of topological superconductivity in hybrid topological insulator-superconductor junctions."}

Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution.

Accurately determining the backbone curve of resonance peaks is pivotal for the design of friction devices. However, the prediction of these curves is computationally challenging owing to the nonconservative and nonsmooth nature of friction nonlinearity. Although techniques such as damped nonlinear normal modes (dNNMs) and phase resonance methods have been applied, they often suffer from convergence issues, and their computational accuracy is compromised under certain conditions. This study proposes a novel method for computing the forced response backbone curves of structures with frictional contact interfaces. The method accurately tracks the backbone curve through a parameter continuation scheme, formulated via Lagrange multipliers and accelerated by incorporating a derived analytical Hessian Tensor of contact elements. This approach yields highly accurate numerical results and enables numerical singularities on the curve to be identified and robustly traversed. The proposed method is validated using an Euler-Bernoulli beam finite-element model and a lumped-parameter blade-damper-blade model. The results demonstrate superior accuracy compared to conventional dNNMs and phase resonance methods, particularly in cases involving either high structural damping or strong frictional damping. This work provides a robust computational tool and presents a detailed comparative analysis that clarifies the applicability and limitations of the proposed and conventional methods."}

Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moiré TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy."}

Traditional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically simulated by constructing asymmetric couplings or by introducing dissipation and gain to realize non-Hermitian systems. The quadratic bosonic system (QBS) with squeezing interaction is intrinsically Hermitian; however, its dynamical evolution matrix in both real and momentum spaces is non-Hermitian. Based on this, applying a field-operator transformation xp to the dynamical evolution matrix yields quadrature nonreciprocal transmission between the x and p operators. This nonreciprocal characteristic can be utilized in signal amplifiers. On the other hand, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in momentum space, one can observe non-Hermitian topological phenomena such as point-gap topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect, both induced by spectra with nonzero winding numbers. Additionally, QBS can be employed to realize non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm cages and to extend non-Bloch band theory. Previous studies in non-Hermitian physics have largely concentrated on classical systems. The influence of non-Hermitian properties on quantum effects remains a key issue awaiting exploration and has evolved into a research direction at the interface of non-Hermitian and quantum physics."}

For slow quenches, the vortex string number follows KZM scaling, while for rapid quenches, it exhibits complementary universal scaling governed by the final temperature.

Hodgkin and Huxley introduced voltage-dependent conductances controlled by gating variables. While these equations reproduce experimental observations, they were derived through curve-fitting without theoretical justification. Modern theoretical physics derives governing equations from symmetry principles through Lie group theory. We prove that the complete Hodgkin-Huxley equations necessarily follow from three fundamental symmetries: (1) compact conformational state spaces, (2) multiplicative conductance scaling, and (3) temporal translation invariance. These symmetries uniquely determine a Lie group structure isomorphic to SO(2) semidirect product with R2. From representation theory, we derive: boundedness from SO(2) compactness, exponential Boltzmann factors from scale invariance, specific integer exponents m3h and n4 from irreducible representations, and first-order kinetics from Lie algebra flows. This demonstrates that the HH equations are not empirical curve-fits but the unique mathematical structure mandated by fundamental symmetries. We reveal why gating variables must be bounded, voltage dependencies must be exponential, sodium requires three activation gates and one inactivation gate, potassium requires four activation gates, and kinetics must be first-order. This establishes that neural electrophysiology obeys the same theoretical framework as modern physics, where symmetries determine dynamics, providing a foundation for understanding channel mutations and network dynamics through group theory."}

Using graphene as a model Dirac system, we disentangle in pump-probe setups Floquet-dressed initial states, Volkov-dressed final states (also known as laser-assisted photoelectric effect, LAPE), and their interference. We quantify how photoemission matrix elements, polarization, incidence angle, and near-surface screening shape the momentum-resolved sideband intensity observed in tr-ARPES. PB1 yields an analytical expression for the momentum-dependent sideband intensity, and for graphene it captures the correct symmetry trends, such as the magnitude of the intensities when considering the interference between the Floquet and Volkov states and photoemission matrix elements. tdNEGF reproduces the full energy-momentum-resolved spectra, including hybridization gaps and spectral-weight redistribution. We find qualitative agreement between PB1 and tdNEGF once matrix elements are included; quantitative differences arise near hybridization regions and at specific angles where higher-order processes and self-energies are essential. Thus, for systems with simple band structures and away from these regions, the two approaches can be used in a complementary way."}

Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting. By relying only on measured scattering parameters, this gradient-free approach is robust to experimental drift and noise and does not require complex full-wave models. Significant performance improvements over traditional simulation-based (in-silico) inverse design are demonstrated, with in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x higher isolation between ports than the best in-silico design at the same target frequency. This work also presents guidelines for applying Bayesian optimization to noisy, high-dimensional physical systems."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Orbital magnetism is a purely quantum phenomenon that reflects intrinsic electronic properties of solids, yet its microscopic description in interacting multiband systems remains incomplete. We develop a general quantum many-body framework for orbital magnetic responses based on the Luttinger-Ward functional. Starting from the Dyson equation, we reformulate the thermodynamic potential in a weak magnetic field and construct a controlled expansion in powers of $B$ applicable to correlated electron systems. A key technical advance is a modified ``Fourier'' representation using noncommutative coordinates, which allows the thermodynamic potential to be expressed in an effective momentum space where the magnetic field acts perturbatively. This formulation makes analytic progress possible within the Moyal algebra. As an application, we derive the spontaneous orbital magnetization and express it entirely in terms of the zero-field Hamiltonian renormalized by the self-energy. For frequency-dependent but Hermitian self-energies, we generalize the orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvature to momentum-frequency space and identify two gauge-invariant contributions built from these quantities. For frequency-independent self-energies the result reduces to the familiar geometric formula for noninteracting systems. This framework provides a unified foundation for computing orbital magnetic responses in correlated multiband materials."}

We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns."}

However, these protocols are generally vulnerable to potential mismatches between the physical modeling and the implementation of their quantum operations, thereby opening opportunities for side channel attacks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD addresses this problem by reducing the degree of device modeling to a black-box setting. The stronger security obtained in this way comes at the cost of a reduced noise tolerance, rendering experimental demonstrations more challenging: so far, only one experiment based on trapped ions was able to successfully generate a secret key. Photonic platforms have however long been preferred for QKD thanks to their suitability to optical fiber transmission, high repetition rates, readily available hardware, and potential for circuit integration. In this work, we assess the feasibility of DIQKD on a photonic circuit recently identified by machine learning techniques. For this, we introduce an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that takes into account full outcome statistics. Our analysis shows that the proposed optical circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization realistic."}

Here, we present a self-aligned heterogeneous quantum photonic integration approach that can deterministically achieve near-unity coupling efficiency at the interface. To showcase our approach, we demonstrate Purcell enhancement of a silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond induced by a heterogeneous photonic crystal cavity defined by titanium dioxide (TiO2), as well as optical spin control and readout via a TiO2 photonic circuit. We further show that, when combined with inverse photonic design, our approach enables efficient and broadband collection of single photons from a color center into a heterogeneous waveguide. Our approach is not restricted to SiV centers or TiO2; it can be broadly applied to integrate diverse solid-state quantum emitters with thin-film photonic devices where conformal deposition is possible. Together, these results establish a practical route to scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits that combine high-quality quantum emitters with technologically mature photonic platforms."}

An interesting issue concerns how this resonance is connected with the existence of particles (tachyons) or quasiparticles (kink solitons) within the hysteresis zone.

Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with Rényi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles."}

Fokker-Planck generalization of the transport-of-intensity equation", "comment": "36 pages, 8 figures, paper to be submitted to Physical Review A", "summary": "The transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) has been very widely employed for phase retrieval. In particular, the TIE is an elliptic second-order partial differential equation which may be solved for the phase of a coherent paraxial field such as a monochromatic scalar optical beam, given the intensity and longitudinal intensity derivative in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis. We show how the coherent flow associated with the TIE may be augmented by a diffusive flow associated with a scalar or tensor diffusion field. Such diffusive flow can arise via scattering from unresolved spatially random microstructure within an illuminated sample, the blurring effects of an extended chaotic source that illuminates the sample, the resolution-reducing effect of shot noise in detected intensity images of the sample, and the sharpening effect (negative diffusion) associated with scattering from sharp sample edges. Augmenting the TIE's modeling of coherent flow with a diffuse-flow channel leads to a Fokker-Planck extension to this equation. Two different TIE augmentations are obtained, using three different derivations. The inverse problems of phase retrieval and diffusion-field retrieval are then studied, for both defocus-based imaging and mask-based imaging (structured-illumination imaging). When symmetric overfocus and underfocus images are employed for the purposes of phase retrieval, the diffusive term drops out and our Fokker-Planck formalism implies that any ensuing TIE-based phase-retrieval method needs no modification in light of our formalism. However, the same focal-series dataset -- which is typically an infocus image, a weakly overfocused image, and a weakly underfocused image -- may also be employed to access the additional channel of information associated with the Fokker-Planck diffusion field. Our formalism is applicable to visible light, x-rays, electrons, and neutrons."}

We investigate a general strategy for incorporating prior beliefs on the regularity of the target energy into linear ACE models and explore to what extent this approach improves the quality of the fitted models.

In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena."}

We show that the critical angular velocity $ω_c$ increases almost linearly with the number of barriers, with a slope set by their height and width. When the system is quenched into the dynamically unstable regime, it emits multiple solitons, which can switch or even reverse the direction of circulation. The stabilization mechanism is robust against imperfections of the potential and does not require a perfectly periodic array of barriers.

This phase diagram, which closely resembles that of high-$T_c$ superconductors, together with a kagome flat band near the Fermi level and possible altermagnetic order, has motivated extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. To better understand how pressure influences the ordered states, we present a systematic study of the evolution of the electronic properties under applied pressure. Performing DFT+DMFT (density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory) calculations, we uncover a complex interplay between the redistribution of spectral weight in the flat bands and the strength of electronic correlations under pressure.

Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ).

Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting.

Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case."}

We further show that the required number of copies may be arbitrarily large -- in particular, for every natural number $N$, we construct sets of states for which exclusion remains impossible with $N$ or fewer copies."}

We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others. We determine the boundary values of atomic densities for which this method is still applicable for describing experiments.

In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit.

This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks.

As parameters like the chemical potential or the width of the junction are tuned, instances of vanishing effective velocity mark the emergence of additional 'Dirac cones' at zero energy and finite momentum. If the junction is subjected to an external magnetic field, Josephson vortices may then bind a number of zero modes in addition to the topological Majorana mode. The additional zero modes are 'symmetry-protected' and can be lifted by a broken mirror symmetry (which is to be expected in realistic scenarios) as well as by an in-plane magnetization (or Zeeman field).

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes."}

By interpreting the analytic structure of amplitudes as the field-theoretic imprint of spacetime geometry, the work establishes a direct correspondence between quantum processes and classical gravitational observables such as metrics, deflection angles, and multipole moments. Starting from the effective-field-theory description of gravity, the thesis shows that loop amplitudes encode not only quantum corrections but also the nonlinear classical self-interaction of the gravitational field, enabling the systematic derivation of the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational quantities by rewriting the Einstein equations in terms of graviton scattering processes. Building upon this foundation, the framework is applied to rotating and charged sources in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. A momentum-space formulation of the energy-momentum tensor is then developed, introducing gravitational form factors and source multipoles that link, for the first time, the internal matter distribution to the external multipolar field in a completely relativistic framework. Furthermore, the thesis completes the transition from the microscopic amplitude picture to the macroscopic description of gravitational sources by engineering a multipole-based framework for black hole mimickers, then applied to build horizon-less compact objects mimicking the multipolar structure of Kerr black holes. Finally, exploiting the Kerr-Schild gauge, the Fourier transforms of rotating black hole metrics are computed in closed form, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative descriptions of gravity, and allowing to probe the multipolar structure of higher-dimensional solutions employing scattering amplitudes."}

Frequency-division multiplexing is expected to enable multiple qubits to be controlled through a single microwave cable; however, interference from off-resonant microwave tones hinders precise qubit control. Here, we propose an active interference suppression method for frequency-division-multiplexed simultaneous gate operations. We demonstrate that deliberate incorporation of off-resonant microwave tones improves the accuracy of single-qubit gates. Specifically, we find that by incorporating off-resonant orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal microwave tones, the gate infidelity decreases proportionally to the inverse square of the number of microwave tones. Furthermore, we show that fast oscillations neglected under the rotating wave approximation degrade gate fidelity, and that this degradation can be mitigated through optimized frequency allocation.

Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization.

In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators.

In practice, however, the physical quantity is a ray (a rank-one projector), so each input specifies only a projector and leaves a gauge freedom in the phases of its vector representatives. This becomes a real operational barrier when one asks for a device that, given two independently prepared unknown pure states, outputs a coherent state proportional to a prescribed linear combination. We identify the missing ingredient as not probabilistic but phase-like. One needs a physical scenario that fixes a single phase convention on the relevant set of rays, so that the overlaps become well defined complex numbers. Thus, we formalize this through phase conventions and a single notion -- dubbed as \"overlap-determinability.\" Our main theorem gives an exact equivalence: A nonzero completely positive trace-nonincreasing map that probabilistically produces superposition on a domain exists if and only if that domain is overlap-determinable. This unifies modern no-superposition results and characterizes the exceptional yes-go protocols, which succeed precisely when side information supplies the required missing resource. We then show that granting universal access to such convention-fixed overlaps destabilizes the familiar foundational and computational constraints. It enables forbidden transformations akin to quantum cloning and yields super-luminal signaling. It would also permit reflections about unknown states, leading to exponentially fast overlap amplification and a collapse of Grover's search lower bound to a logarithmic query complexity."}

Large active spaces are required to converge the variational energy, but ulitmately orbital optimization produces worse diffusion Monte Carlo energies when compared to standard orbitals from density functional theory. We show that this increased bias is due to larger locality errors from the use of pseudopotentials, while the fixed-node error is actually improved by using orbital optimization.

While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production.

By exploiting the noncommutativity between propagation and sensing processes, our scheme achieves a 1/N^2-scaling precision limit without involving entangled probes. Importantly, our approach utilizes a classical mixture of causal orders rather than a quantum switch, making it more feasible for practical realization. We experimentally implement this scheme for distributed beam tilts sensing in a free-space quantum optical network comprising up to 9 sensors, achieving picoradian-scale precision in estimating tilt angle.

In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators. These findings establish rhombohedral multilayer graphene as an ideal platform for studying strong correlations and topologies in semimetals."}

By interpreting the analytic structure of amplitudes as the field-theoretic imprint of spacetime geometry, the work establishes a direct correspondence between quantum processes and classical gravitational observables such as metrics, deflection angles, and multipole moments. Starting from the effective-field-theory description of gravity, the thesis shows that loop amplitudes encode not only quantum corrections but also the nonlinear classical self-interaction of the gravitational field, enabling the systematic derivation of the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational quantities by rewriting the Einstein equations in terms of graviton scattering processes. Building upon this foundation, the framework is applied to rotating and charged sources in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. A momentum-space formulation of the energy-momentum tensor is then developed, introducing gravitational form factors and source multipoles that link, for the first time, the internal matter distribution to the external multipolar field in a completely relativistic framework. Furthermore, the thesis completes the transition from the microscopic amplitude picture to the macroscopic description of gravitational sources by engineering a multipole-based framework for black hole mimickers, then applied to build horizon-less compact objects mimicking the multipolar structure of Kerr black holes. Finally, exploiting the Kerr-Schild gauge, the Fourier transforms of rotating black hole metrics are computed in closed form, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative descriptions of gravity, and allowing to probe the multipolar structure of higher-dimensional solutions employing scattering amplitudes."}

Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization. In addition, these are limited by construction to a restricted set of phase-only superposition measurements. Here we show how the coupling of spatial and temporal information inside a single multi-mode fiber can be harnessed to program completely generalized measurements for high-dimensional superpositions of photonic time-bin. Using the multi-spectral transmission matrix of the fiber, we find special sets of spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays through the fiber. By exciting coherent superpositions of these spatial modes, we engineer the equivalent of large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber and use them to perform high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions in up to dimension 11.

The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to blend the local dynamics rather than the trajectories of individual nodes. Perturbation analysis then shows that, under sufficiently strong coupling, all node trajectories tend to stay close to those of the blended system over time. We first show that this theory extends naturally to the reduced-state dynamics of quantum networks, revealing classical-like clustering phenomena in which qubits converge to a shared equilibrium or a common trajectory determined by the quantum blended reduced-state dynamics. We then extend the analysis to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs, proving orbit attraction of the network density operator toward the quantum blended coherent dynamics, establishing the emergence of intrinsically quantum and dynamically clustering behaviors. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results."}

By exploiting the noncommutativity between propagation and sensing processes, our scheme achieves a 1/N^2-scaling precision limit without involving entangled probes. Importantly, our approach utilizes a classical mixture of causal orders rather than a quantum switch, making it more feasible for practical realization. We experimentally implement this scheme for distributed beam tilts sensing in a free-space quantum optical network comprising up to 9 sensors, achieving picoradian-scale precision in estimating tilt angle. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable DQS protocol that surpasses the conventional 1/N Heisenberg scaling in precision, advancing the practical deployment of quantum sensing networks."}

We develop a general quantum many-body framework for orbital magnetic responses based on the Luttinger-Ward functional. Starting from the Dyson equation, we reformulate the thermodynamic potential in a weak magnetic field and construct a controlled expansion in powers of $B$ applicable to correlated electron systems. A key technical advance is a modified ``Fourier'' representation using noncommutative coordinates, which allows the thermodynamic potential to be expressed in an effective momentum space where the magnetic field acts perturbatively. This formulation makes analytic progress possible within the Moyal algebra. As an application, we derive the spontaneous orbital magnetization and express it entirely in terms of the zero-field Hamiltonian renormalized by the self-energy. For frequency-dependent but Hermitian self-energies, we generalize the orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvature to momentum-frequency space and identify two gauge-invariant contributions built from these quantities. For frequency-independent self-energies the result reduces to the familiar geometric formula for noninteracting systems. This framework provides a unified foundation for computing orbital magnetic responses in correlated multiband materials."}

It is widely known that typical pure states yield vanishing work, just as thermal states do, when one restricts to local operations that cannot access correlations among subsystems. However, it remains unclear whether this equivalence to thermal states persists under LOCC (local operations and classical communication), where classically accessible correlations can be exploited for work extraction. In this work, we establish criteria for determining whether many-body pure states remain equivalent to thermal states even under LOCC, and show that this thermal equivalence is governed by their multipartite quantum correlation structure. We show that states with asymptotically maximal multipartite entanglement, such as Haar-random states, cannot yield extensive work under LOCC, whereas some states with limited multipartite entanglement, such as constant-degree graph states, allow extensive work extraction despite being locally indistinguishable from thermal states. Thus, our work provides a refined operational notion of thermal equivalence beyond the traditional local regime, which is becoming increasingly important due to the recent expansion of experimentally accessible operations."}

We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others.

In this note, we compute the total phase of Vasiliev higher spin gravity on the sphere by summing over the contributions of all spins. We evaluate the resulting infinite sum using two different regularization schemes, obtaining consistent results.

Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers.

Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\\it Phys.

The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case.

We demonstrate that precisely engineered atomic arrangements lead to unconventional quantum dynamics, featuring non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in the continuum, thereby providing a versatile platform for implementing two-dimensional quantum memory. Phenomenologically, we observe the emergence of exotic photon emission patterns in both two- and three-dimensional (3D) baths. The emission directions are shown to be precisely controllable on demand through exact phase engineering of the coupling parameters, enabling a highly efficient chiral light-matter interface.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Orbital magnetism is a purely quantum phenomenon that reflects intrinsic electronic properties of solids, yet its microscopic description in interacting multiband systems remains incomplete. We develop a general quantum many-body framework for orbital magnetic responses based on the Luttinger-Ward functional. Starting from the Dyson equation, we reformulate the thermodynamic potential in a weak magnetic field and construct a controlled expansion in powers of $B$ applicable to correlated electron systems. A key technical advance is a modified ``Fourier'' representation using noncommutative coordinates, which allows the thermodynamic potential to be expressed in an effective momentum space where the magnetic field acts perturbatively. This formulation makes analytic progress possible within the Moyal algebra. As an application, we derive the spontaneous orbital magnetization and express it entirely in terms of the zero-field Hamiltonian renormalized by the self-energy. For frequency-dependent but Hermitian self-energies, we generalize the orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvature to momentum-frequency space and identify two gauge-invariant contributions built from these quantities. For frequency-independent self-energies the result reduces to the familiar geometric formula for noninteracting systems. This framework provides a unified foundation for computing orbital magnetic responses in correlated multiband materials."}

Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior.

IOP Publishing", "summary": "Negating the Measurement Independence assumption (MI) is often referred to as the `third way' to account for the experimental violation of Bell's inequality. However, this route is generally viewed as ludicrously contrived, implying some implausible conspiracy where experimenters are denied the freedom to choose measurement settings as they like. Here, a locally realistic model of quantum physics is developed (Rational Mechanics - RaQM - based on a gravitational discretisation of Hilbert Space) which violates MI without denying free will. Crucially, RaQM distinguishes experimenters' ability to freely choose measurement settings to some nominal accuracy, from an inability to choose exact settings, which were never under their control anyway. In RaQM, Hilbert states are necessarily undefined in bases where squared amplitudes and/or complex phases are irrational numbers. Such `irrational' bases correspond to conceivable but necessarily impossible counterfactual measurements, and are shown to play a ubiquitous role in the analysis of both single- and entangled-particle quantum physics. It is concluded that violation of Bell inequalities can be understood with none of the strange processes historically associated with it. Instead, using concepts from (non-classical) $p$-adic number theory, we relate RaQM to Bohm and Hiley's concept of a holistic Machian-like Undivided Universe. If this interpretation of Bell's Theorem is correct, building more and more energetic particle accelerators to probe smaller and smaller scales, in the search for a theory which synthesises quantum and gravitational physics and hence a Theory of Everything, may be a fruitless exercise."}

In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$.

We consider the multipartite entanglement of states in $\\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ using the recently proposed entropic fill.\n  Numerically evaluating entropic fill in the case of equal spins between $1/2$ and $11$, we find that the distributions of entanglement are very different for intertwiners as compared to generic tensors, and for coherent intertwiners as compared to generic ones. The peak in the distribution seems to be at the highest entanglement for generic intertwiners and at the lowest for generic tensors, but in terms of average entanglement, the roles are switched: average entanglement is highest in arbitrary tensors and lower in intertwiners, at least in the regime of large $j$. We also find that entanglement depends on the geometric data of coherent intertwiners in a complicated way."}

Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum."}

It has long been known that EPR at high magnetic fields offers greater spectral resolution, but limitations in the THz instrumentation have prevented the full realization of these opportunities. Here we describe an EPR spectrometer at the high magnetic field of 14 T using 396 GHz excitation, which adapts techniques from liquid-state NMR to obtain sharp EPR resonances with a width of 210 ppb (full-width half-maximum). We use this to measure resonance positions, and hence g-factors, with a precision that reaches $\\pm$16 ppb. Our use of in-situ liquid-state NMR of our solvent within the same sample improves the accuracy of these measurements: it allows us to reference our EPR measurement back to dilute gas 3He NMR for which quantum calculations are accurate. We measure the g-factor of N@C60 in deuterated toluene as g = 2.002 099 09 (3), where the 3 in brackets means that the uncertainty on the last digit is $\\pm$3."}

In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena."}

Heterogeneous integration offers a potential solution to this challenge, yet practical implementations have been limited by inevitable insertion losses at material interfaces. Here, we present a self-aligned heterogeneous quantum photonic integration approach that can deterministically achieve near-unity coupling efficiency at the interface. To showcase our approach, we demonstrate Purcell enhancement of a silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond induced by a heterogeneous photonic crystal cavity defined by titanium dioxide (TiO2), as well as optical spin control and readout via a TiO2 photonic circuit. We further show that, when combined with inverse photonic design, our approach enables efficient and broadband collection of single photons from a color center into a heterogeneous waveguide. Our approach is not restricted to SiV centers or TiO2; it can be broadly applied to integrate diverse solid-state quantum emitters with thin-film photonic devices where conformal deposition is possible. Together, these results establish a practical route to scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits that combine high-quality quantum emitters with technologically mature photonic platforms."}

Here, we present an analytic theory of Kerr-enhanced three-wave mixing amplification in an electro-optic microresonator with both $χ^{(2)}$ and $χ^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate that Kerr dressing hybridizes the optical sidebands, renormalizing the $χ^{(2)}$ couplings and detunings. As a result the system exhibits gain in regions where analogous bare $χ^{(2)}$ or $χ^{(3)}$ amplifiers are subthreshold. Time-domain Langevin simulations confirm this threshold reduction, mapping a practical design window for experiments."}

By resolving the condensate in energy-momentum space and performing interferometric measurements, we distinguish the condensate from thermalized particles yet occupying excited states macroscopically. In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 065301 (2022)], we observe segmentation of the particle density along the excited states into two fractions both following Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with different effective temperatures and chemical potentials. Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states."}

We find that an appropriate choice of the pulses times can enforce an approximate symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the total magnetization. The interaction channels emerging from higher-order Floquet terms affect three-body bound states (\\emph{trimers}), which gain a significant mobility. We estimate the corresponding enhancement in 1D spin chains and conclude that their dynamics is within experimental reach. Detrimental effects due to the proliferation of particles outside of the trimer magnetization sector are found to occur and spread on time-scales slower than the trimer propagation. Moreover, these can be suppressed in higher dimensional lattices, e.g. in 2D triangular lattices, as the lattice geometry brings these processes off resonance. Our results establish a concrete route to realizing mobile multiparticle bound states in Floquet-engineered Rydberg platforms."}
