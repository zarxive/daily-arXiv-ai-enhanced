Abstract: We study the Hilbert series for $5d$ Superconformal Field Theories (SCFTs)
engineered by Generalized Toric Polygons (GTPs), which extend the geometric
realization of these theories from toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds to theories
associated to general webs of 5- and 7-branes. Smoothed T-cones provide
fundamental building blocks of GTP tessellations, generalizing the role of
minimal triangles in toric diagrams. Building on this construction, we propose
an extension of the Martelli-Sparks-Yau algorithm for computing Hilbert series
of toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds that computes the Ehrhart series directly from GTP
tessellations. The Ehrhart series is an invariant under Hanany-Witten
transitions, which translate geometrically into polytope mutations.

### [2] [A Brief Note on Complex AdS-Schwarzschild Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08883)
*Raghu Mahajan,Kaustubh Singhi*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper examines the thermodynamics of asymptotically AdS spaces and finds that despite the existence of complex black holes at low temperatures, they do not contribute to the gravitational path integral, maintaining thermal AdS as the dominant saddle at low temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermodynamic behavior of AdS spaces and black holes is fundamental in theoretical physics, particularly in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.

Method: The authors analyze the on-shell actions of thermal AdS and AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, using a mini-superspace approximation and contour integration arguments to assess their contributions to the path integral.

Result: The study concludes that complex black holes do not dominate the gravitational path integral at low temperatures, supporting the traditional view that thermal AdS is the relevant saddle.

Conclusion: This work clarifies the role of complex black holes in the thermodynamic and quantum gravity context of AdS spaces.

Abstract: In the context of thermodynamics of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, it
is often stated that at very low temperatures, there is only one saddle point
available-namely, thermal AdS-and hence this sole saddle dictates the
low-temperature behavior. However, AdS-Schwarzschild black holes continue to
exist at low temperatures as complex saddle points. We point out that the real
part of the on-shell action of these complex black holes is smaller than that
of thermal AdS at the lowest temperatures, in AdS$_5$ and higher dimensions.
So, na\"ively, they should be the "dominant" saddles. This raises a puzzle: if
these complex black holes were indeed the relevant saddle points, the physics
of the bulk and that of the dual gauge theory would completely disagree at low
temperatures. Using a mini-superspace approximation and contour arguments, we
argue that these complex black holes do not actually contribute to the
gravitational path integral, regardless of the value of their on-shell action.
So the standard conclusion that thermal AdS is the correct saddle at the lowest
temperatures continues to hold. We also comment on two related matters: whether
the Kontsevich-Segal criterion is useful in this setting, and whether the
unstable small black hole contributes to the path integral in the
high-temperature phase.

Abstract: We show how to construct Hamiltonian lattice theories with one exact
supersymmetry on arbitrary triangulations of curved space in any number of
dimensions. Both bosons and fermions satisfy discrete K\"{a}hler-Dirac
equations. The quantization of the fermions proceeds by imposing conventional
anti-commutation relations while the bosons require a modification of the usual
canonical commutator. On regular lattices we construct parity, time reversal
and translation-by-one (shift) symmetries. We argue that the latter are
generically non-invertible symmetries. We also show how to couple these degrees
of freedom to background gauge fields which leads to a theory with enhanced
supersymmetry.

Result: 在双峰谱中两者无明显区别，但在高阶相关函数中可区分。结果符合有效场论的对称性。

Conclusion: 自旋场的详细描述不影响双峰谱的共现信号，这有助于宇宙学信号的解释。

Abstract: We consider the dynamics of massive spinning fields during inflation and the
resulting signatures in the cosmological correlators of inflaton perturbations
computed in the Poincar\'{e} patch of de Sitter space. There are (at least) two
ways to describe the fluctuations of such new spinning degrees of freedom and
these are distinguished by the symmetries of the de Sitter group that they
linearly realise. The primary question we ask is: do these two set-ups yield
distinct signatures in cosmological observables? After systematically deriving
the Feynman rules for exchange diagrams consisting of massive spinning fields,
where we discover the necessity of \textit{effective propagators} that augment
the naive Schwinger-Keldysh ones by delta functions corresponding to
instantaneous propagation, we show that the two set-ups are indistinguishable
at the level of the inflaton bispectrum but distinguishable at the level of the
trispectrum and other higher-point correlation functions. The bispectrum is
special since in the corresponding tree-level Feynman diagrams, only the
helicity-zero modes of the spinning fields can propagate. The bispectrum
correspondence holds up to the addition of contact diagrams arising from the
self-interactions of the inflaton, and is consistent with the symmetries of the
effective field theory inflation. Our results suggest that the cosmological
collider signals in the bispectrum are universal and do not depend on the
detailed description of the massive spinning field.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Two-point functions in BCFTs exhibit characteristic singularities compared to
standard CFTs due to reflected light cones. In holographic BCFTs, further
singularities, which need not be related to reflected light cones within the
BCFT, can arise when the insertion points are connected by bulk null geodesics.
The resulting `bulk-cone singularities' are expected to be an artifact of the
`t Hooft limit and should be resolved in string theory. In this work we
demonstrate the resolution of bulk-cone singularities in braneworld BCFT duals,
where bulk-cone singularities arise from geodesics reflected off the
end-of-the-world brane. We show that the geometry near the null geodesics is
described by a pp-wave of shockwave form and incroporate string theory
corrections, which bounds the two-point functions. We extend this discussion to
top-down holography for D1/D5 BCFTs.

to explicitly construct an $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supercurrent in the Beauty and the
Beast module of Dixon, Ginsparg, and Harvey. Using their techniques, we show
that $\mathcal{N} = 1$ superconformal symmetry exists in all VOAs constructed
as spin lifts of canonical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifolds of Niemeier lattice VOAs.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We uncover a surprising universal soft behaviour (USB) of a de Sitter (dS)
S-matrix for \textit{all} exceptional effective field theories (EFTs) in dS
space, stemming from the recently proposed generalised energy conservation
(GEC) condition. At leading order in the soft limit, the dS S-matrices for all
exceptional EFTs exhibit no scaling with the soft momentum, i.e.
$\lim_{k\rightarrow 0}\mathcal{A}(k)\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, a feature we term USB.
We specifically show that USB fixes the four-point amplitudes in
Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory and Special Galileon, and six-point amplitude in
$SU(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) given the minimal derivative count. We
then conjecture USB fixes the interactions of all exceptional EFTs to all
orders, thereby providing a unification criterion for them. Our result further
underpins the idea that $\Delta\geq 4$ exceptional theories in dS are
characterised by the spectrum and stability requirement alone, resonating with
the low energy theory of gravity--General Relativity.

Abstract: I study the internal structure of the Dirac magnetic monopole in a
deconstructed $U(1)$ gauge theory. The deconstructed $U(1)$ gauge theory has a
product $U(1)^N$ gauge group, which breaks down to the diagonal
$U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group. A linear superposition of the Dirac
monopoles each from each $U(1)$ gauge group placed on top of each other in the
3D space constitutes a Dirac monopole with a unit magnetic charge under the
unbroken $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group. However, the Dirac monopole in
each $U(1)$ gauge group has a fractional magnetic charge of the unbroken
$U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group with the same sign, which makes these
``constituent'' Dirac monopoles repel each other. Therefore, for the
``composite'' Dirac monopole of the $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group to be
stable, there must be attractive forces that counter the repulsive magnetic
Coulomb forces. I argue that such attractive forces are provided by the
Nielsen-Olesen type magnetic flux tubes of unbroken gauge groups. This internal
structure of the composite Dirac monopole of $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group
resembles the composite magnetic monopole found in the model constructed by
Saraswat arXiv:1608.06951. I estimate the size of the Dirac monopole in
$U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group from the balance between the magnetic
Coulomb forces and the forces from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes.
Implications of the results for the Weak Gravity Conjecture are briefly
discussed.

Abstract: Coupling quantum field theory (QFT) \!-\! even free QFT \!-\! to gravity
leads to well-known problems. In particular, the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$
(gravity's source) and its correlators typically diverge in the UV, creating a
conflict between the wildly inhomogeneous spacetime we expect quantum
mechanically and the weakly-curved, macroscopic spacetime we observe. Are there
QFTs for which these divergences cancel? Here, for simplicity, we consider free
quantum fields on a classical curved background. The aforementioned divergences
are related to the running of the gravitational couplings. We calculate the
corresponding beta functions, identifying a special class of QFTs with UV fixed
points at which $\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle$ and all its correlators $\langle
T\ldots T\rangle$ are UV finite. An intriguing example is a theory like the
Standard Model (including right-handed neutrinos) with $12$ gauge fields, $3$
generations of $16$ Weyl fermions and $36$ four-derivative (Fradkin-Tseytlin)
scalars. In the infrared, this theory has a positive Newton's constant $G$ and
an arbitrarily small cosmological constant $\Lambda$.

Abstract: We perform a supersymmetric truncation of the N=3 dilaton Weyl multiplet with

another 32+32 off-shell multiplet in N=2 conformal supergravity by coupling the
N=2 scalar-tensor multiplet to the N=2 standard Weyl multiplet. We then
establish the equivalence between these two multiplets through a mapping. We
observe that this multiplet is gauge equivalent to a Poincar\'e supergravity
multiplet as it has all the compensators necessary to go from conformal
supergravity to Poincar\'e supergravity.

Abstract: We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct
gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and
massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau
$Y[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\hat{s}_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the
probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These
particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with
3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices
$\Phi_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}_3}]}$ on a basis
of the
  BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q_c$, BRST operators. We
found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q_c$ and off-shell BRST
invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different
configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to
construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.

Motivation: 引力理论中的许多基本性质，如温度、视界和热力学量的存在，都依赖于视界面上的引力常数的恒定性。高曲率引力理论和Proca场的引入，使得进一步探索这些性质变得不可或缺。

Method: 研究者采用提升权重的途径，成功处理了Proca场带来的额外复杂性。他们通过在主两导数理论的基础上，逐级引入高曲率贡献，实现了对引力常数恒定性的证明。这也表明，即使在高曲率理论中，基本的微分几何性质仍然保持。”

Result: 研究者在任意高曲率引力理论中，结合了Proca场（无U(1)规范对称性），证明了Killing视界上引力常数的恒定性。这一结论扩展了零定律到这一更广泛的理论类别中。这一结果在有效场论框架内，对高斯曲率贡献的任何阶数展开都是成立的。

Conclusion: 总的来说，研究者通过有效的场论方法，证明了在广义的高曲率引力理论下，Killing视界上引力常数的恒定性。这不仅拓展了理论的适用范围，也为进一步研究这些理论中的热力学性质提供了坚实的基础。这表明，即使引入了多余的高曲率项，基本的几何属性仍然保持。这也为未来在高曲率理论中探索其他热力学性质铺平了道路。

Abstract: We prove the constancy of surface gravity across a Killing horizon (not
necessarily of bifurcate type) in arbitrary higher curvature theories of
gravity coupled to Proca fields $-$ vector fields lacking $U(1)$ gauge
invariance $-$ thus generalizing the zeroth law to this broader class of
theories. This is achieved within the framework of effective field theory,
where higher curvature contributions are treated perturbatively around the
leading two derivative theory. The result holds to arbitrary order in the
effective field theory expansion. The proof is based on boost-weight arguments;
implementing these arguments in the presence of a Proca field introduces
subtleties beyond those encountered in the pure-gravity case, which we address
here.

Abstract: In this work we examine in more detail the perturbative map between late-time

Sitter space, elaborating on the general construction presented in
arXiv:2007.09993 and arXiv:2109.02725 for EFTs of bosonic spinning fields by
treating explicitly the cases of gauge bosons and gravitons. In these cases,
additional technical subtleties arise from the treatment of massless
representations of the de Sitter isometry group in even boundary dimensions,
which we clarify in this work. Finally, we emphasise that the relation between
dS and EAdS perturbation theory is manifest in Mellin space. These results
provide a streamlined framework for the study of cosmological correlators
involving spinning fields.

Abstract: We investigate Snyder space-time and its generalizations, including Yang and
Snyder-de-Sitter spaces, which constitute manifestly Lorenz invariant
noncommutative geometries. This work initiates a systematic study of gauge
theory on such spaces in the semi-classical regime, formulated as Poisson gauge
theory. As a first step, we construct the symplectic realization of the
relevant noncommutative spaces, a prerequisite for defining Poisson gauge
transformations and field strengths. We present a general method for
representing the Snyder algebra and its extensions in terms of canonical phase
space variables, enabling both the reproduction of known representations and
the derivation of novel ones. These canonical constructions are employed to
obtain explicit symplectic realizations for the Snyder-de-Sitter space and
construct the deformed partial derivative which differentiates the underlying
Poisson structure. Furthermore, we analyze the motion of freely falling
particles in these backgrounds and comment on the geometry of the associated
spaces.

TL;DR: Instantons in 4d Yang-Mills have an infrared divergent one-instanton partition function due to the size moduli problem and long-range $1/r^4$ interactions. U(1) lattice gauge theory, where instantons are monopole loops, also suffers from similar issues. However, when accounting for $1/r^4$ interactions as arising from $1/r^2$ interactions between current segments, the theory becomes infrared safe and is dual to a lattice abelian Higgs model, exhibiting mass gap and confinement through monopole condensation.

Motivation: This paper addresses a long-standing issue in Yang-Mills theory and its lattice version, providing insights into confinement mechanisms through the study of instantons and monopole interactions.

Method: Mathematical analysis of the instanton configuration space, lattice gauge theory, and renormalization group techniques are employed to examine the interactions and divergences.

Result: The strongly coupled U(1) lattice gauge theory is infrared safe and exhibits confinement through monopole condensation, offering a new perspective on confinement in Yang-Mills theory.

Conclusion: The internal structure of instantons contributes to confinement in 4d Yang-Mills theory, parallels the role of instantons in 2d sigma models.

Abstract: It is well-known that the standard instanton analysis in 4d Yang-Mills is
plagued with the instanton size moduli problem, which renders the instanton
contribution to vacuum energy density (or one-instanton partition function)
infrared divergent. The formalism also ignores the implications of long range
(magnetic dipole type) $1/r^4$ interaction between the small instantons, since
it is weaker than Coulomb interaction. We show that in $U(1)$ lattice gauge
theory, where finite action configurations are monopole loops, small loops at
large separations also interact with the same type of $1/r^4$ interaction. If
one ignores the classical interactions between monopoles, following the same
idea as in Yang-Mills theory, the one-monopole partition function is also
infrared divergent at strong coupling. However, $1/r^4$ interactions among
small loops should be viewed as a consequence of multipole expansion, and
emanate from $1/r^2$ interaction between current segments. Taking interactions
into account, one can prove that the strongly coupled $U(1)$ lattice gauge
theory is dual to a lattice abelian Higgs model, and more importantly, free of
infrared divergences. The model exhibits mass gap and confinement by monopole
condensation. We suggest that the structure of moduli space of instantons, ADHM
data, and the long ranged classical interactions in pure Yang-Mills theory
should be examined with this refined perspective. We conjecture that, in
contradistinction to the current views on the subject, internal structure of
instantons in Yang-Mills theory is responsible for confinement in $4d$ ,
similar to sigma model in $d=2$ dimensions.

Abstract: We present a constructive method to maximize the expectation value of
operators that implement a symmetry on a subsystem, making use of modular
tools. More generally, we study the positive cones associated with a von
Neumann algebra, as defined by Araki. Given a reference vector, an algebra, and
a state on the algebra, the purification of the state in the cone $\alpha = 0$,
associated with the reference vector and the algebra, yields the unique vector
whose overlap with the reference vector is maximal among all possible
purifications. This establishes that the supremum in Uhlmann's theorem is
uniquely attained by this vector, thereby providing the fidelity between the
given state and the state obtained by restricting the reference vector to the
algebra. Moreover, this purification can be explicitly constructed using
modular tools. In addition, given an automorphism of the algebra, we show how
to construct isometries implementing the automorphism using the positive cones.
We prove that the isometry constructed from the cone $\alpha = 0$ is the one
with maximal expectation value among all possible isometries implementing the
automorphism. We illustrate these ideas with two simple examples: one involving
a system of two spins, and the other in the theory of the massless scalar field
in 3+1 dimensions.

Abstract: Kinetic constraints are generally expected to slow down dynamics in many-body
systems, obstructing or even completely suppressing transport of conserved
charges. Here, we show how gauge theories can defy this wisdom by yielding
constrained models with faster-than-diffusive dynamics. We first show how, upon
integrating out the gauge fields, one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theories
are exactly mapped onto XX models with non-local constraints. This new class of
kinetically constrained models interpolates between free theories and highly
constrained local fermionic models. We find that energy transport is
superdiffusive over a broad parameter regime. Even more drastically, spin
transport exhibits ballistic behavior, albeit with anomalous finite-volume
properties as a consequence of gauge invariance. Our findings are relevant to
current efforts in quantum simulations of gauge-theory dynamics and anomalous
hydrodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We give a bosonic realization of the SU(3) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg (AFH)
chain in the alternating conjugate representation, and study its phase diagram
as a function of staggered interactions and anisotropy along the $T^3$ and
$T^8$ directions. Unlike the SU(2) case, we observe a chiral-reversed quantum
phase transition, where each competing phase is adiabatically connected to one
of the chiral Haldane phases predicted in the SU(3) AFH chain with local
adjoint representation. In the vicinity of the Heisenberg point, we identify a
symmetry-protected topological state that appears at the first excited energy
level. We also study the spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry breaking of the
system, and provide a variational wavefunction that captures the transition
from the topological phase to the trivial phase. Finally, we propose an
experimental realization of our bosonic model by two spin-1/2 bosons in an
optical lattice.

Abstract: We study the impact of weak quenched disorder on the BCS-BEC crossover in the
Hubbard model within a functional-integral framework. By deriving the
thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and
pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number
equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero
temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the
known continuum limits of weakly interacting bosons, where weak disorder
depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken
translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the
overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a
unified and controlled framework for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in
disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions
to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.

Abstract: Thermal conditions in the urban canopy exhibit stochastic variability driven
by varied radiative fluxes and turbulent wind fields, requiring probabilistic
rather than deterministic prediction methods. This study presents a
probabilistic framework for predicting the spatial and temporal intensity and
variability of outdoor thermal comfort in tropical urban environments. The
framework integrates ground-measured meteorological data and remote sensing
urban morphological data to calculate Physiological Equivalent Temperature
(PET), and applies K-means, XGBoost, and Monte Carlo simulations on PET
training and inference. The prediction model achieved strong performance, with
R2, RMSE, and SMAPE values of 0.93, 0.81 degC, and 1.34% for PET_mean, and
0.85, 0.38 degC, and 10.44% for PET_std, respectively. A case study showed
clear spatial heterogeneity of outdoor thermal comfort. Locations with dense
tree canopies and vegetated surfaces displayed a normalized percentage of
acceptable thermal comfort (NATC) up to 65%, whereas built-up zones dominated
by impervious surfaces, such as industrial estates and high-density residential
areas, recorded NATC below 30%. Greenery was found to mitigate both the
intensity of heat stress and its variability, producing a stable and
comfortable microclimate. Daytime PET_std ranged from 4.0-4.5 degC in built-up
areas to 1.5-2.0 degC in greenery-covered zones, while nighttime PET_std
decreased to 2.2-2.4 degC and 1.2-1.4 degC, respectively. These findings
emphasize the critical role of greenery in mitigating thermal variability and
enhancing outdoor thermal comfort, while revealing the stochastic nature of
thermal comfort across different urban morphologies.

Abstract: Superfluid He nanodroplets resonantly excited by extreme ultraviolet (XUV)
pulses exhibit complex relaxation dynamics, including the formation of
metastable excited He$^*$ atoms trapped in bubbles, the desorption of excited
atoms from the droplet surface, and autoionization via interatomic Coulombic
decay (ICD). Irradiation with intense infrared pulses can trigger avalanche
ionization, leading to the formation and subsequent expansion of a He
nanoplasma. Here, we introduce a novel approach to probe the ICD dynamics over
timescales spanning femtoseconds to nanoseconds. Our method exploits the
efficient ignition of a nanoplasma through tunnel ionization of excited helium
atoms attached to the droplets and the detection of XUV fluorescence emitted
from the resulting nanoplasma. Using quantum mechanical and classical
calculations, we interpret the nanosecond fluorescence decay as a signature of
ICD mediated by He$^*$ freely roaming on the nanodroplet surface.

Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum for scalar perturbations
of static, magnetically charged black holes in the presence of a quintessence
field. The background geometry is obtained from the Einstein-Power-Maxwell
action with a Kiselev-type contribution for quintessence. The associated master
wave equation is solved using complementary numerical approaches, including
high-order WKB expansions, the asymptotic iteration method, and time-domain
integration, with cross-validation to ensure accuracy. The results show that
magnetic charge generally lowers the oscillation frequency of fundamental
modes, while the quintessence parameter modifies damping timescales. A
dedicated analysis of the metric's derivation confirms the correct form of the
magnetic charge term. We explore a theoretical parameter space to understand
the mathematical behavior of the solution, including extreme regimes not
intended to represent astrophysical realities. The computed scalar field
spectra provide a foundational study for future work on gravitational
perturbations. All numerical data and codes are provided to ensure
reproducibility.

TL;DR: BA: describes the systematics of waveform models for EMRNIs and presents methods to mitigate their effects. Quantifies error sources, such as mode truncation and interpolation, and finds optimized parameters for accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave observations of EMRNIs are a key goal for space-based observatories. Accurate waveform models are essential for parameter estimation of EMRNIs, so understanding and reducing systematic errors is critical.

Method: This paper analyzes potential sources of systematic error in relativistic waveform models for EMRNIs. They identify two key sources: mode-sum truncation errors and interpolation errors. Rather than assuming that the data is entirely accurate, they measure and quantify these errors. They also develop an efficient Chebyshev interpolation scheme to reduce the number of grid points required for accurate interpolation.

Result: The paper presents a detailed analysis of systematic errors in EMRI waveform models. They determine that for circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins greater than 0.9, a mode truncation of ℓ_max ≥ 30 is required for accurate results. They also develop an interpolation scheme that uses significantly fewer grid points than traditional methods. Additionally, they demonstrate that interpolating the flux to a maximum global relative error equal to the small mass ratio is sufficient for parameter estimation purposes for EMRI signals of 4 years duration, SNRs around 100, and mass ratios in the range of 10^-4 to 10^-6. This method yields mismatches below 10^-3 and negligible parameter estimation biases.

Conclusion: This paper makes important contributions to the understanding of systematic errors in EMRI waveform models and provides practical methods to minimize these errors. The findings are crucial for improving parameter estimation techniques for EMRNIs observed by space-based gravitational wave observatories.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is essential for
extracting reliable information from future space-based gravitational wave
observatories. Fast waveform generation frameworks adopt an offline/online
architecture, where expensive relativistic computations (e.g. self-force and
black hole perturbation theory) are performed offline, and waveforms are
generated rapidly online via interpolation across a multidimensional parameter
space. In this work, we investigate potential sources of error that result in
systematic bias in these relativistic waveform models, focusing on
radiation-reaction fluxes. Two key sources of systematics are identified: (i)
the intrinsic inaccuracy of the flux data, for which we focus on the truncation
of the multipolar mode sum, and (ii) interpolation errors from transitioning to
the online stage. We quantify the impact of mode-sum truncation and analyze
interpolation errors by using various grid structures and interpolation
schemes. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins larger than $a \geq
0.9$, we find that $\ell_{\text{max}} \geq 30$ is required for the necessary
accuracy. We also develop an efficient Chebyshev interpolation scheme,
achieving the desired accuracy level with significantly fewer grid points
compared to spline-based methods. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetimes, we
demonstrate via Bayesian studies that interpolating the flux to a maximum
global relative error that is equal to the small mass ratio is sufficient for
parameter estimation purposes. For 4-year long quasi-circular EMRI signals with
SNRs$= \mathcal{O}(100)$ and mass-ratios $10^{-4}-10^{-6}$, a global relative
error of $10^{-6}$ yields mismatches $<10^{-3}$ and negligible parameter
estimation biases.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Merger gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescence carry rich
information about the underlying spacetime dynamics. We analyze merger waves
from comparable-mass and extreme-mass-ratio binaries, obtained from numerical
relativity and black-hole perturbation theory, respectively, and argue that
they are dominated by the prompt wave emissions as the black holes collide.
This signal, which we refer to as the direct wave, is modulated by the plunging
motion and selectively screened by the gravitational potential of the remnant
black hole. The direct wave typically exhibits a time-dependent frequency and
decay rate, but for high-spin remnants $(\gtrsim0.7)$ the ergosphere renders it
mode-like, with a quasi-stable instantaneous oscillation frequency close to the
superradiant frequency. We further estimate its detectability in a
GW150914-like system and find that the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed $\sim
10$ with the current ground-based detector network. Our results therefore
identify the direct wave as a robust observable for analyzing black hole
ringdowns in current and future gravitational wave events.

TL;DR: A higher-order gravity model with corrections up to mass dimension six is constructed. Analyzing the FLRW background, the model exhibits desirable features of inflation, such as a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point. Inflationary predictions are consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data for |γ0|≦10^−3. However, for negative γ0 values, the model aligns with recent ACT, Planck, and DESI results, indicating potential relevance of higher-order corrections to inflationary cosmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inflationary models are key for understanding the universe's early expansion. This paper explores higher-order corrections which might refine inflationary predictions, aligning with recent observational data.

Method: The paper considers a specific action with corrections up to six dimensions, focusing on the FLRW background. It derives field equations, specializes to FLRW, and studies the dynamics through a four-dimensional autonomous system. They analyze the linearized equations near a critical point and compute scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio.

Result: The model shows desirable inflationary features, such as a slow-roll attractor and stable critical point, consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data for certain γ0 values. Negative γ0 values align with recent ACT, Planck, and DESI results.

Conclusion: The higher-order gravity model provides a refined description of inflationary dynamics, with predictions consistent with observational data, suggesting the potential importance of higher-order terms in inflationary cosmology.

Abstract: We construct a higher-order gravity model including all corrections up to
mass dimension six. Starting from the Jordan frame, we derive the field
equations and specialize to the FLRW background, where the dynamics take the
form of a four-dimensional autonomous system. Focusing on the
$R+R^{2}+RR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the
parameter $\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model
exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a
slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of
inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck,
BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\gamma_{0}|\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative
values of $\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck and DESI
results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may play a relevant role in
refining inflationary cosmology.

Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics and predictions in the theory of warped
massive gravity. This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive
graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and
has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We
identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale
factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary
conditions for the St\"uckelberg fields and one characterized by a special
tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case,
we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need
of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and
comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble

Abstract: We investigate neutron stars with nonlinear magnetic monopoles in the
framework of the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics model, specifically within
the Bardeen and Hayward models. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equations for three different equations of state, we find that upon reaching
the critical magnetic charge $q_{c}$, neutron stars enter frozen states
characterized by the critical horizon. This extends the concept of frozen
states to compact objects composed of ordinary matter (non-field matter),
thereby offering a new perspective for related research.

conduct a comprehensive analysis of the system's thermodynamics. We examine the
thermodynamic properties of the Einstein-Geometric Proca AdS compact objects,
focusing on the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, heat capacity, entropy, and
Gibbs free energy. Particular attention is given to the dependence of the
Hawking temperature, enthalpy, and heat capacity on the uniform potential
$q_{1}$ and the electromagnetic-type charge $q_{2}$. Through numerical analysis
we compute the entropy and Gibbs free energy and investigate how these
quantities vary with the model parameters.

*Yuhao Guo,Zhen Zhong,Yifan Chen,Vitor Cardoso,Taishi Ikeda,Lihang Zhou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We demonstrate that ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states, analogous to molecular states, when the binary separation is below the boson's Bohr radius. These states' ionization dynamics depend on the binary's eccentricity, and their backreaction can influence the binary's orbital evolution. Simulations involving both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions are used to derive semi-analytic formalisms, revealing that early stages of ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Cookie Jar, you're a test bot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of ultralight bosons in binary systems provides a potential avenue for understanding phenomena such as gravitational waves. By modeling their bound states and ionization dynamics, this research contributes to our understanding of how light particles can influence the orbital evolution of binaries.

Method: The research involves simulating the formation of gravitational bound states of ultralight bosons, determining their co-moving regions, and computing ionization fluxes for different binary eccentricities. Semi-analytic formalisms are developed to describe the ionization dynamics of both co-moving and non-co-moving regions. The consistency of these models with numerical simulations is verified. Binary orbital evolution driven by ionization fluxes is then analyzed.

Result: The key findings are that ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission at early stages, leading to a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, the ionization of the co-moving region is solely caused by the binary's eccentricity, resulting in orbital circularization.

Conclusion: Ultralight bosons can form gravitationally bound states comparable to molecules when the binary separation is below their Bohr radius. Their ionization dynamics and backreaction on binary evolution are successfully modeled, with early ionization potentially dominating over gravitational wave emission and causing spectral changes in the gravitational wave background.

Abstract: Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally
bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below
the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We
simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their
co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for
various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe
the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions,
demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization
fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early
stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission,
producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background.
Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary
eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.

Abstract: Gastruloids are 3D stem cell aggregate models for early embryogenesis that
provide a unique platform to study how collective cell dynamics drive tissue
symmetry breaking and axial elongation. Using 3D light sheet imaging, we show
that a pulse of Chiron, a Wnt activator, induces coherent alignment of cell
polarity during elongation. While nuclear elongation occurs with or without
treatment, only Chiron-treated gastruloids exhibit quasi-long-range alignment
of nuclear axes, linking cell polarity coherence to tissue-scale remodeling. A
minimal physical model of polarized cells, incorporating alignment-dependent
torques and polarity-mediated adhesion, reproduces symmetry breaking and
elongation, demonstrating that local cell polarity alignment alone can drive
tissue-scale convergence-extension flows.

Conclusion: COMSOL Multiphysics effectively enables the implementation of PIDE models for studying directed cell migration and its role in biological processes.

Abstract: We present a COMSOL Multiphysics implementation of a continuum model for

guidance cues to capture phenomena such as cell sorting and aggregation. Our
framework supports simulations in one, two, and three dimensions, with both
zero-flux and periodic boundary conditions, and can be reformulated in a
Lagrangian setting to efficiently handle tissue growth and domain deformation.
We demonstrate that COMSOL Multiphysics enables a flexible and accessible
implementation of PIDEs, providing a generalizable platform for studying

Abstract: Stochastic modeling of gene expression is a classic problem in theoretical
biophysics. However, models formulated via chemical master equation have long
been considered analytically intractable unless burst approximation is applied.
This article shows that general stochastic gene expression models with an
arbitrary number of gene states admit direct analysis. Based on chemical master
equation and high-dimensional binomial moment method, we derive recurrence
relations for binomial moments in steady state, yielding analytical expressions
to arbitrary order in a hierarchical manner. Subsequently, the joint
probability mass function of mRNA and protein copy number can be reconstructed.
An algorithm is developed for numerical computation. Particularly, explicit
expressions for low-order cumulants are presented. Compared with models under
burst approximation, the first-order cumulant remains exact, whereas the
second-order cumulant typically differs. We estimate the difference between two
second-order binomial moments using functional analysis, therefore evaluating
the validity of burst approximation.

Abstract: Directing extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles,
toward specific cells is an emerging focus in nanomedicine, owing to their
natural role as carriers of proteins, RNAs, and drugs. EVs can be manipulated
by external electric fields due to their intrinsic surface charge and
biophysical properties. This study investigates the feasibility of using
extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields to guide EV transport. A
theoretical framework based on the Fokker-Planck equation was developed and
numerically solved to model vesicle trajectories under time-harmonic drift.
Computational simulations were conducted to systematically assess the influence
of key electric field parameters, including phase, frequency, and intensity, on
vesicle displacement and trajectory. The findings demonstrate that frequencies
below 5 Hz combined with field strengths of 200-2000 V/m can induce substantial
directional control of EV motion. Moreover, enhanced directivity was achieved
through the application of multi-component electric fields. Overall, this work
establishes a theoretical foundation for the external-field-based beamforming
of nanoparticles within the framework of molecular communication.

Conclusion: 交配中的交叉互换模式主要是由性染色体的分离方式决定的。

Abstract: Chromosomal crossovers play a crucial role in meiotic cell division, as they
ensure proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic variability.
Experiments have consistently revealed two key observations across species: (i)
the number of crossovers per chromosome is typically small, but at least one,
and (ii) crossovers on the same chromosome are subject to interference, i.e.,
they are more separated than expected by chance. These observations can be
explained by a recently proposed coarsening model, where the dynamics of
droplets associated with chromosomes designate crossovers. We provide a
comprehensive analysis of the coarsening model, which we also extend by
including material exchanges between droplets, the synaptonemal complex, and
the nucleoplasm. We derive scaling laws for the crossover count, which allows
us to analyze data across species. Moreover, our model provides a coherent
explanation of experimental data across mutants, including the wild-type and
zyp1-mutant of A. thaliana. Consequently, the extended coarsening model
provides a solid framework for investigating the underlying mechanisms of
crossover placement.

Abstract: Symmetry governs nature's law, yet many of the natural phenomena occur due to
the breakdown of symmetry. Here, we show how isotope-induced inversion symmetry
breaking influences ultrafast photoisomerization processes in ethylene. Using
extreme ultraviolet pump-near infrared probe time-of-flight mass spectrometry,
we find that replacing one of the carbon atoms in ethylene with a 13C isotope
leads to twice-faster structural relaxation via ethylene-ethylidene
isomerization in the photo-excited molecular cation. Advanced trajectory
surface hopping calculations incorporating the nuclear symmetry of the
molecular systems, reveal that it arises from the mixing of different normal
modes in the isotope-substituted species, interactions otherwise forbidden by
symmetry. Although the mixing does not alter the symmetry of the electronic
Hamiltonian, it modifies that of the nuclear Hamiltonian, causing explicit
symmetry breaking. This facilitates efficient intra-molecular vibrational
energy redistribution, lowering the isomerization yield. Our findings offer
opportunities to use isotope-induced nuclear symmetry breaking to control the
outcome of light-molecule interactions across ultrafast timescales.

Abstract: Poor scaling of dynamics simulations with number of dimensions is currently a
major limiting factor in the simulation of photochemical processes. In this
work, we investigate ways to reduce the dimensionality of many-atom systems
with a view toward enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining
accuracy. Using mixed quantum-classical Trajectory Surface Hopping (TSH)
simulations of three photoreactive molecules - trans-azomethane (tAZM),
butyrolactone (Bulac), and furanone (Fur) - we explore two different
dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
Normal Mode Variance (NMV). Dynamics simulations are run in full dimensionality
and reduced dimensionality, employing either PCA or NMV, and the impact of the
dimensionality reduction on selected electronic and geometric properties of the
dynamics is evaluated. For all three molecules, both PCA and NMV can be used to
select lower-dimensional spaces in which the full-dimensionality dynamics
results are reproduced. PCA reduction outperforms NMV in all systems, allowing
for a more significant dimensionality reduction without loss of accuracy. The
improved accuracy of PCA is, for tAZM, mostly seen in the electronic properties
while for both Fur and Bulac the advantage is clear in the ring-opening
reaction itself as well. The present approach opens routes to simulation of
larger photochemically relevant systems, through the use of automated
dimensionality reduction, avoiding human bias.

Abstract: Short-in-time, broad-in-energy attosecond or few-femtosecond pulses can
excite coherent superpositions of several electronic states in molecules. This
results in ultrafast charge oscillations known as charge migration. A key open
question in the emerging field of attochemistry is whether these electron
dynamics, which due to decoherence often last only for a few femtoseconds, can
influence longer-time scale nuclear rearrangements. Herein, we address this
question through full-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations of the coupled
electron-nuclear dynamics initiated by ionization and coherent excitation of
ethylene. The simulations of this prototype organic chromophore predict
electronic coherences with half-lives of less than 1 fs. Despite their brevity,
these electronic coherences induce vibrational coherences along the derivative
coupling vectors that persist for at least 50 fs. These results suggest that
short-lived electronic coherences can impart long-lasting legacies on nuclear
motion, a finding of potential importance to the interpretation of attosecond
experiments and the development of strategies for attochemical control.

Abstract: Electrochemical energy and substance conversion devices involve complex
electrode processes, characterized by multiple charge transfer steps, competing
pathways, and various intermediates. Such complexity makes it challenging to
enhance electrocatalytic activity. The prevailing strategy typically focuses on
optimizing the geometric and electronic structures of the electrocatalysts to
align the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates with the peak of the
activity Volcano curve. In this study, we demonstrate that surface decoration
can effectively shape the micro reaction environment for the model system of
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt electrodes. By applying a partial
hydrophobic I* adlayer on the Pt surface, we can shift the equilibrium of OH*
reduction and weaken H2O* adsorption, which significantly enhances ORR
kinetics. With in situ scan tunneling microscopy (STM) and theoretical
calculations, our study reveals the formation of isolated Pt2 surface units
situated in a hydrophobic valley surrounded by adsorbed iodine atoms. This
minimalist Pt2 active unit exhibits significantly greater activity for ORR
compared to an extended Pt surface. This strategy could pave the way for
developing highly efficient catalysts with potential applications in fuel cell
technology and metal air batteries and extension to other electrochemical
conversion reactions such as ammonia synthesis and CO2 reduction.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) is an emergent platform for exploring
exotic quantum phases driven by the interplay between nontrivial band topology
and strong electron correlations. Direct experimental access to its
momentum-resolved electronic structure is essential for uncovering the
microscopic origins of the correlated topological phases therein. Here, we
report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of
tMoTe$_2$, revealing pronounced twist-angle-dependent band reconstruction
shaped by orbital character, interlayer coupling, and moir\'e potential
modulation. Density functional theory (DFT) captures the qualitative evolution,
yet underestimates key energy scales across twist angles, highlighting the
importance of electronic correlations. Notably, the hole effective mass at the
K point exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on twist angle, peaking near
2{\deg}, consistent with band flattening at the magic angle predicted by
continuum models. Via electrostatic gating and surface dosing, we further
visualize the evolution of electronic structure versus doping, enabling direct
observation of the conduction band minimum and confirm tMoTe$_2$ as a direct
band gap semiconductor. These results establish a spectroscopic foundation for
modeling and engineering emergent quantum phases in this moir\'e platform.

Conclusion: This work could lead to advancements in quantum materials and topological states, revolutionizing material science and condensed matter physics by introducing a new degree of freedom through sliding to control geometric topological phases.

Abstract: Sliding is a ubiquitous phenomenon in moir\'e systems, but its direct
influence on moir\'e bands, especially in multi-twist moir\'e systems, has been
largely overlooked to date. Here, we theoretically show that sliding provides a
unique pathway to engineer the quantum geometry (Berry curvature and quantum
metric) of moir\'e bands, exhibiting distinct advantages over conventional
strategies. Specifically, we first suggest alternating twisted trilayer
$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ (AT3L-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$) and chirally twisted triple bilayer
graphene (CT3BLG) as two ideal paradigmatic systems for probing
sliding-engineered quantum geometric phenomena. Then, two sliding-induced
exotic quantum geometry phenomena are predicted: (1) an intrinsic nonlinear
Hall effect via sliding-produced non-zero Berry curvature dipole, with CT3BLG
as an ideal platform; (2) significant quantum metric modulation in
AT3L-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$, enabling tests of quantum geometric criteria for
fractional Chern insulating state (FCIS). Our work establishes sliding as a new
degree of freedom for manipulating quantum geometry of moir\'e bands, which
emerges as a signature phenomenon of multi-twist moir\'e systems.

have remained elusive. Here, using spatially and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy ({\mu}-ARPES), we directly map the electronic band structure of
tbMoTe2. We identify the valence band maximum, whose partial filling underlies
the FQAHE, at the K points, situated approximately 150 meV above the {\Gamma}
valley. By fine-tuning the doping level via in-situ alkali metal deposition, we
also resolve the conduction band minimum at the K point, providing direct
evidence that tbMoTe2 exhibits a direct band gap - distinct from all previously
known moire bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide systems. These results
offer critical insights for theoretical modeling and advance our understanding
of fractionalized excitations and correlated topological phases in this
emergent quantum material.

Abstract: We theoretically study the dynamics of gain-driven magnon-polaritons (MPs),
which characterizes auto-oscillation of MPs, across the strong coupling (SC)
and ultrastrong coupling (USC) regimes. Taking into account the magnon dynamics
via the magnetic flux, we present an effective circuit model of gain-driven
MPs, which allows to manipulate the coupling strength of MPs by tuning the size
of a ferromagnet and incorporates the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons due to
the shape magnetic anisotropy. In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr
nonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon
coupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent
magnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also
effectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies,
resulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one
to widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic
field. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the
coupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons. This work
is attributed to understanding of the interplay between gain-loss and USC in
nonlinear polariton dynamics, offering a novel principle for frequency tunable
maser-like devices based on gain-driven MPs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators faces
fundamental challenges, including narrow topological gaps and low Curie
temperatures ($T_{\text{C}}$) in existing materials. Here, we propose a
transformative strategy using bilateral hydrogenation to engineer a robust QAH
state in the topologically trivial ferromagnetic semiconductor
Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$. First-principles calculations
reveal that hydrogenation induces a topological phase transition in
Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$ by shifting its Dirac
points-originally embedded in the conduction bands-to the vicinity of the Fermi
level in Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$H$_{\text{6}}$. This
electronic restructuring, coupled with spin-orbit coupling, opens a global
topological gap of 118.1 meV, establishing a robust QAH state with Chern number
$C=$ 3. Concurrently, hydrogenation enhances ferromagnetic superexchange via
the $d_{z^{2}}$-$p_{z}$-$d_{xz}$ channel, significantly strengthening the
nearest-neighbor coupling $J_{\text{1}}$ by 3.06 times and switching
$J_{\text{2}}$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. Monte Carlo simulations
predict a high $T_{\text{C}}$ = 198 K, sustained well above liquid nitrogen
temperature and far exceeding pristine
Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$ (28 K). This work establishes
surface hydrogenation as a powerful route to simultaneously control topology
and magnetism in 2D materials, unlocking high-temperature QAH platforms for
dissipationless spintronic applications.

TL;DR: Bimerons and antibimerons in easy-plane magnets exhibit unique soliton properties, making them superior for nonlinear interactions in non-volatile reservoir computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses the potential of solitons in magnetic materials for advanced computing applications, proposing that bimerons and antibimerons are more suitable than skyrmions and antiskyrmions.

Method: The study uses first-principles calculations and transition state theory to analyze the behavior of solitons in a van der Waals heterostructure.

Result: The research identifies unique soliton properties in bimerons and antibimerons, particularly their distinct structural symmetry and impact on soliton interactions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the promising potential of bimerons and antibimerons for spintronic and reservoir computing applications.

Abstract: Soliton-based computing architectures have recently emerged as a promising
avenue to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional information
technologies, the von Neumann bottleneck. In this context, magnetic skyrmions
have been widely considered for in-situ processing devices due to their
mobility and enhanced lifetime in materials with broken inversion symmetry.
However, modern applications in non-volatile reservoir or neuromorphic
computing raise the additional demand for non-linear inter-soliton
interactions. Here we report that solitons in easy-plane magnets, such as
bimerons and antibimerons, show greater versatility and potential for
non-linear interactions than skyrmions and antiskyrmions, making them superior
candidates for this class of applications. Using first-principles and
transition state theory, we predict the coexistence of degenerate bimerons and
antibimerons at zero field in a van der Waals heterostructure
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ -- an experimentally feasible system. We
demonstrate that, owing to their distinct structural symmetry, bimerons exhibit
fundamentally different behavior from skyrmions and cannot be regarded as their
in-plane counterparts, as is often assumed. This distinction leads to unique
properties of bimerons and antibimerons, which arise from the unbroken
rotational symmetry in easy-plane magnets. These range from anisotropic
soliton-soliton interactions to strong entropic effects on their lifetime,
driven by the non-local nature of thermal excitations. Our findings reveal a
broader richness of solitons in easy-plane magnets and underline their unique
potential for spintronic devices.

Abstract: Recent experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have
demonstrated that moir\'e semiconductors can be used to realize a relativistic
Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a
correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of
van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir\'e valence bands,
suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in
this moir\'e semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum
model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the
system's moir\'e valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the
Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions
across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to
band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$
in the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole
filling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model
for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\'e
honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost
bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent
Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent
Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad
parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich
variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future
experiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar
spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial
spin-density wave.

Abstract: The combination of solid state single-photon emitters and mechanical
excitations into hybrid infrastructures is a promising approach for new
developments in quantum technology. Here we investigate theoretically the
resonance fluorescence (RF) spectrum of an acoustically modulated single-photon
emitter under arbitrarily strong optical driving. In the spectrum, the
combination of Mollow triplet physics and phonon sidebands results in a complex
structure of crossings, anti-crossings, and line suppressions. We apply Floquet
theory to develop an analytical expression for the RF spectrum. Complemented
with perturbative and non-perturbative techniques, this allows us to fully
understand the underlying acousto-optical double dressing physics of the hybrid
quantum system, explaining the observed spectral features. We use these
insights to perform an experimental feasibility study of existing emitter-based
acousto-optical platforms and come to the conclusion that bulk acoustic waves
interfaced with quantum dots render a promising infrastructure to perform
acousto-optical Floquet engineering.

Abstract: In this work, making use of time-resolved in situ Joule heating of a

thermal conductance measurements for the {\nu} = 5/2 and {\nu} = 7/3 fractional
quantum Hall (FQH) states for electron temperatures ranging from 20 to 150 mK.
We compare our findings with a recent study by Melcer et al. [Nature 625, 489

states. In spite of the large size difference and the vastly different
experimental schemes used to extract \k{appa}xx, we find in large part that
both experiments yield similar results and conclude that the bulk of FQH states
thermally conducts and violate the Wiedemann-Franz law by a wide margin. Slight
discrepancies between both studies are further discussed in terms of
particle-hole symmetry in the vicinity of the 5/2 and 7/3 FQH states.

*Haoyang Tian,Vatsal Dwivedi,Adam Yanis Chaou,Maxim Breitkreiz*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper presents a theory explaining the field-linear magnetoconductance in interfaces between two Weyl semimetals, demonstrating that this behavior is robust against disorder up to a critical field strength, B_arc, after which disorder has no effect. Below B_arc, the slope depends on the fraction of Weyl nodes instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of magnetoconductance in Weyl semimetals and its dependence on magnetic field and disorder is crucial for advancing the field of topological materials and their applications in spintronics.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the transport properties in Weyl semimetal interfaces under magnetic fields, incorporating quantum kinetic theory and considering the effects of disorder and spatial correlations.

Result: The study finds that the magnetoconductance is linear with the magnetic field strength at all field strengths below a critical value, B_arc, which depends on the scattering time versus the traversal time of Fermi arcs. Above B_arc, the linear behavior is lost, and the slope depends on the fraction of Weyl nodes instead of the number of topological interfaces.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive explanation for the observed field-linear magnetoconductance in Weyl semimetal interfaces and offers insights into the conditions under which disorder affects this phenomenon.

Abstract: A clean interface between two Weyl semimetals features a universal,
field-linear tunnel magnetoconductance of $(e^2/h)N_\mathrm{ho}$ per magnetic
flux quantum, where $N_\mathrm{ho}$ is the number of chirality-preserving
topological interface Fermi arcs. In this work we show that the linearity of
the magnetoconductance is robust with to interface disorder. The slope of the
magnetoconductance changes at a characteristic field strength $B_\mathrm{arc}$
-- the field strength for which the time taken to traverse the Fermi arc due to
the Lorentz force is equal to the mean inter-arc scattering time. For fields
much larger than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the magnetoconductance is unaffected by
disorder. For fields much smaller than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the slope is no longer
determined by $N_\mathrm{ho}$ but by the simple fraction $N_\mathrm{L}
N_\mathrm{R}/(N_\mathrm{L}+N_\mathrm{R})$, where $N_\mathrm{L}$ and
$N_\mathrm{R}$ are the numbers of Weyl-node pairs in the left and right Weyl
semimetal, respectively. We also consider the effect of spatially correlated
disorder potentials, where we find that $B_\mathrm{arc}$ decreases
exponentially with increasing correlation length. Our results provide a
possible explanation for the recently observed robustness of the negative
linear magnetoresistance in grained Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: The synthetic frequency dimension, which realizes fictitious spatial
dimensions from the spectral degree of freedom, has emerged as a promising
platform for engineering artificial gauge fields in studying quantum
simulations and topological physics with photons. A current central task for
frequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial
non-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics.
Here, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating
non-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a
polarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering
spin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and
polarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic
Floquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging
self-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a
trembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the
frequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and
Bloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian
electric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge
theory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and
spinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain
optical computation and multimodal frequency comb control.

Result: The results show third-harmonic generation efficiencies of up to -15 dB (3.2%) under continuous-wave excitation at 0.1 MW/cm² intensity and nonlinear frequency shifts of 0.5~THz under pulsed excitation, consistent with simulations.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of tailored graphene-based metasurfaces for efficient nonlinear THz photonic devices, with promising performance for continuous-wave and pulsed applications.

Abstract: Graphene's exceptional nonlinear optical properties combined with resonant
photonic structures offer a promising pathway for efficient nonlinear
applications at terahertz (THz) frequencies. In this work, we propose and
demonstrate a fabrication-friendly hybrid nonlinear metasurface composed of
gold patches integrated with uniform graphene, circumventing the need for
complex graphene patterning. The structure supports strong localized resonances
that enhance nonlinear interactions. By exploiting resonant enhancement at both
the fundamental and third harmonic frequencies, we predict via simulations
third-harmonic generation efficiencies as high as -15 dB (3.2%) under
continuous-wave excitation at modest intensities (0.1 MW/cm$^2$). The
metasurface is fabricated via electron-beam lithography and experimentally
characterized using THz time-domain spectroscopy. Under pulsed excitation, we
experimentally observe pronounced nonlinear frequency shifts up to 0.5~THz
(12.5% fractional change), driven by self-phase modulation, consistent with
simulation results. These findings highlight the potential of tailored

Abstract: Supersolidity - simultaneous superfluid flow and crystalline order - has been
realized in quantum atomic systems but remains unexplored in purely photonic
platforms operating at weak light-matter coupling. We predict a supersolid
phase of light in a plasma-filled optical microcavity, where photons acquire
effective mass and interact via nonlocal, plasma-mediated nonlinearities. By
deriving a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a tunable photon-photon interaction
kernel, we show that under coherent driving the cavity light field can
spontaneously crystallize into a supersolid lattice via modulational
instability. Crucially, this supersolid arises from a weak photon-electron
coupling enabled by virtual electronic transitions, and it does not require
hybrid polariton formation. Using doped semiconductor microcavities, we
identify feasible conditions (electron densities $\sim 10^{10}-
10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and optical intensities $\sim
10^{2}-10^{4}~\mathrm{W/cm}^{2}$) for experimental realization. This work
establishes plasmonic cavities as a platform for correlated photonic matter
with emergent quantum order.

Abstract: Precision atomic and quantum experiments rely on ultra-stable narrow
linewidth lasers constructed using table-top ultra-low expansion reference
cavities. These experiments often require multiple lasers, operating at
different wavelengths, to perform key steps used in state preparation and
measurement required in quantum sensing and computing. This is traditionally
achieved by disciplining a cavity-stabilized laser to a key atomic transition
and then transferring the transition linewidth and stability to other lasers
using the same reference cavity in combination with bulk-optic frequency
shifting such as acousto-optic modulators. Transitioning such capabilities to a
low cost photonic-integrated platform will enable a wide range of portable, low
power, scalable quantum experiments and applications. Yet, today's bulk optic
approaches pose challenges related to lack of cavity tunability, large free
spectral range, and limited photonic integration potential. Here, we address
these challenges with demonstration of an agile photonic-integrated 780 nm
ultra-high-Q tunable silicon nitride reference cavity that performs multiple
critical experimental steps including laser linewidth narrowing, high
resolution rubidium spectroscopy, dual-stage stabilization to a rubidium
transition, and stability transfer to other lasers. We achieve up to 20 dB of
frequency noise reduction at 10 kHz offset, precision spectroscopy over a 250
MHz range, and dual-stage locking to rubidium with an Allan deviation of $8.5
\times 10^{-12}$ at 1 s and up to 40 dB reduction at 100 Hz. We further
demonstrate the transfer of this atomic stability to a second laser, via the
rubidium-disciplined cavity, and demonstrate multi-wavelength Rydberg
electrometry quantum sensing. These results pave the path for integrated,
compact, and scalable solutions for quantum sensing, computing and other atomic
and trapped ion applications.

Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials are increasingly attracting interest in engineering
applications due to their unique mechanical properties and lightweight nature.
This study develops a novel sound-based representation to characterize the
topologies of mechanical metamaterials, including spinodal designs and porous
cellular structures. Two distinct frameworks are introduced: an image-based
approach, where material topologies are divided into grids and their relative
densities are mapped to evolving melodies, and a numerical simulation approach,
where finite element analysis (FEA) visualizes mechanical responses as
color-coded images, translated into unique musical compositions. By applying
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the generated melodies are analyzed as
frequency plots, revealing distinct acoustic signatures for each material
topology. This innovative approach not only distinguishes between different
metamaterial designs but also provides an intuitive, auditory tool for material
characterization. The results demonstrate the potential of sound-based
representations to complement traditional methods in materials modeling,
offering new avenues for design and analysis.

Abstract: The investigation and analysis of exotic physical phenomena facilitated by
metamaterials have emerged as a compelling area of interest in physics,
material science, and engineering. However, there remains a lack of suitable
theoretical tools for scrutinizing light-matter interactions in metamedia,
particularly those involving distinct constitutive tensors, such as
polarization cross-coupling or non-reciprocal propagation induced by
bianisotropy. In this research, we apply the generalized transfer matrix method
and matrix Fourier Optics to devise a novel hybrid methodology adept at
efficiently tracing an optical beam as it propagates through
transverse-homogeneous, longitudinal-inhomogeneous bianisotropic media. Our
proof-of-concept demonstration elucidates the interaction between a nonparaxial
Gaussian incident beam with various linear/circular polarizations and a
mismatched anisotropic double-negative (DNG) metamaterial. We unveil the
nontrivial bifocal effect and optical vortex (OV) generation and focusing
phenomena in a three-dimensional environment, findings that have not been
documented previously. Significantly, the proposed efficient methodology holds
the potential for application in examining more promising physical phenomena
exhibited by intricate metamaterials, enabling a more visually rigorous

Abstract: Silicon photonics provides a versatile platform for large-scale integration
of optical functions, but its weak intrinsic nonlinear response limits the
realization of active, intensity-dependent functionalities. Hybrid integration
of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a promising strategy to
overcome these limitations by enabling strong light--matter interaction and
broadband absorption. Here, we demonstrate saturable absorption in a
Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) microring resonator integrated with an exfoliated monolayer of 1T'-MoTe2.
Transmission measurements under varying input powers reveal a clear nonlinear
absorption response, with a saturation power as low as 2(1)uW. A
phenomenological model accurately reproduces the experimental results,
confirming the nonlinear behavior induced by the hybrid MoTe2 integration.
These findings establish a proof-of-concept for ultracompact, low-power
saturable absorbers in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), paving the way for
applications in integrated lasers, ultrafast optical signal processing, and
neuromorphic photonics.

Abstract: This work demonstrates the multifaceted dynamic motion and three-dimensional
(3D) spatial manipulation of organic micro ring resonators (MRRs). The MRRs are
fabricated via surface-tension-assisted self-assembly of
2,2'-((1E,1'E)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))bis(3,5-dibromophenol)

whispering gallery modes. Interestingly, the MRRs are micromechanically
reconfigurable into various strained architectures, including lifting,
transferring, vertical standing, axial spinning, and wheel-like rolling, using
an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip. The MRRs retained their photonic
traits throughout these dynamic motions, underscoring their mechanical
robustness. Notably, the demonstration of axial spinning and rolling locomotion
extends the manipulation capabilities beyond two-dimensional control, enabling
complete 3D spatial control. These results establish a foundational platform
for next-generation NLO mechanophotonic systems, where reconfigurable smart and
soft photonic elements can be dynamically controlled with high spatial

They experimentally validate this with a chip-integrated microcomb.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore and harness chaotic behavior in nonlinear optical systems, specifically in photonic integrated systems, with potential applications in randomness-based technologies.

Method: The method involves phase modulation of the Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) between a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) and an injected reference laser. They use a chip-integrated octave-spanning microcomb to experimentally validate the second-order Adler equation that describes KIS.

Result: The result is the successful demonstration of a deterministic framework for triggering microcomb chaos in the solitonic state. They observe chaotic group velocity hopping leading to random transitions of the repetition rate.

Conclusion: This work bridges nonlinear dynamics with soliton physics, providing a foundation for understanding and controlling chaotic behavior in optical systems, with potential applications in advanced photonic technologies.

Abstract: Chaos enables randomness-based applications, particularly in photonic
systems. Integrated optical frequency combs (microcombs) have previously been
observed in either chaotic modulation instability or stable, low-noise
dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regimes. In this work, we demonstrate a new
microcomb state where a single DKS exhibits chaotic behavior. By phase
modulating the Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) between a DKS and an
externally injected reference laser, we observe chaotic group velocity hopping
of the soliton, causing random transitions of the repetition rate. Using a
chip-integrated octave-spanning microcomb, we experimentally validate the
second-order Adler equation describing KIS, allowing us to predict and
demonstrate this chaotic DKS hopping. This work connects nonlinear dynamics
with optical soliton physics, providing a deterministic framework for
triggering microcomb chaos in the solitonic state.

Abstract: The sensitivity of transmission to the input wavefront is a hallmark feature
of complex media and the basis for wavefront shaping techniques. Yet,
intriguing special cases exist in which the output wavefront is "frozen"
(agnostic to the input wavefront). This happens when special structure in the
complex medium collapses the rank of its transmission matrix to unity. Here, we
unveil that an analogous phenomenon exists more universally for differential
scattering (including reflection) in reconfigurable complex media.
Specifically, for a localized perturbation, the differential scattering matrix
of any complex medium has rank one. One consequence is that the differential
output signal is perfectly coherent irrespective of the input wavefront's
coherence. Moreover, the thermal noise emitted into the frozen differential
output mode has a particular structure that can be exploited for thermal noise
management. We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a
rich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom. Then,
we demonstrate "customized freezing" by optimizing the configuration of
additional programmable meta-atoms that parametrize the wireless link, as
envisioned for 6G networks. We impose particular shapes of the frozen
differential output mode, and maximize its signal-to-thermal-noise ratio.
Potential applications include filtering and stabilization of differential
wavefronts, as well as imaging, sensing, and communication in complex media.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems,
but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable,
fast, and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, like D-Wave's cryogenic
hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of
qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs.
Here, we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic
oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin
representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks, our architecture solves
fully-connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings), and $>$41,000
spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system leverages cascaded thin-film
lithium niobate modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier, and a digital
signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating
potential $>$200 giga-operations per second for spin coupling and nonlinearity.
This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic
Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate
best-in-class solution quality for Max-Cut problems of arbitrary graph
topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain
ground-state solutions for number partitioning and lattice protein folding -
benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system leverages
inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate
convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP - traditionally used in
optical communications - within optical computation enhances convergence and
solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for
optimization, neuromorphic processing, and analog AI.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new technique for high-resolution sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). By focusing on a tip-substrate nanogap, they achieve spatial resolution down to 10 nm, overcoming the diffraction limit of conventional far-field SFG. They demonstrate the capability to resolve nanoscale structural variations in molecular adsorption across different interfacial domains. A comprehensive theoretical framework is developed to interpret the observed TE-SFG spectra, showing that the dominant mechanism is dipole-field interactions, not higher-order multipole effects. This work opens a new avenue for nanoscale molecular structure and dynamics studies in inhomogeneous interfacial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With advances in nanotechnology and materials science, there is growing interest in understanding molecular structures and orientations at the nanoscale. Conventional SFG techniques are limited by the diffraction of light, which reduces their resolution to micrometer scales. This paper aims to address this limitation by developing a more advanced technique that can achieve nanoscale resolution.

Method: The researchers used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to create a tip-substrate nanogap and perform sum-frequency generation spectroscopy. They focused on the optical near field within this nanogap to achieve high spatial resolution. They also developed a comprehensive theoretical framework to interpret the observed spectra.

Result: The researchers demonstrated that their new technique can achieve spatial resolution down to 10 nm, which is nearly two orders of magnitude improvement over conventional SFG. They also showed that their technique can resolve nanoscale variations in molecular adsorption structures across different interfacial domains. Their theoretical framework confirms that the dominant mechanism is dipole-field interactions, not higher-order multipole effects.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking technique for high-resolution SFG spectroscopy, enabling nanoscale studies of molecular structures and dynamics in inhomogeneous interfacial systems. By leveraging the optical near field within a tip-substrate nanogap, they have overcome the diffraction limit of conventional SFG and opened new possibilities for nanoscale molecular studies.

Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) is a powerful second-order nonlinear
spectroscopic technique that provides detailed insights into molecular
structures and absolute orientations at surfaces and interfaces. However,
conventional SFG based on far-field schemes suffers from the diffraction limit
of light, which inherently averages spectroscopic information over
micrometer-scale regions and obscures nanoscale structural inhomogeneity. Here,
we overcome this fundamental limitation by leveraging a highly confined optical
near field within a tip-substrate nanogap of a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM), pushing the spatial resolution of SFG down to ~10 nm, a nearly
two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over conventional far-field SFG. By
capturing tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectra concurrently with STM scanning, we
demonstrate the capability to resolve nanoscale variation in molecular
adsorption structures across distinct interfacial domains. To rigorously
interpret the observed TE-SFG spectra, we newly developed a comprehensive
theoretical framework for the TE-SFG process and confirm via numerical
simulations that the TE-SFG response under our current experimental conditions
is dominantly governed by the dipole-field interactions, with negligible
contributions from higher-order multipole effects. The dominance of the dipole
mechanism ensures that the observed TE-SFG spectra faithfully reflect not only
nanoscale interfacial structural features but also absolute up/down molecular
orientations. This study presents the first experimental realization of
diffraction-unlimited second-order nonlinear vibrational SFG nanoscopy, opening
a new avenue for nanoscale domain-specific investigation of molecular
structures and dynamics within inhomogeneous interfacial molecular systems
beyond the conventional far-field SFG and STM imaging.

Conclusion: 多 EP 间的相互作用导致更丰富的拓扑现象，通过态投影可实验观察拓扑特征。

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems are branch singularities
where eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce, leading to rich
topological phenomena beyond those in Hermitian systems. In this work, we
systematically investigate the interplay between eigenenergy braiding and Berry
phase accumulation in two-level non-Hermitian systems hosting pairs of EPs. EP
pairs are classified into four distinct classes according to the vorticity of
eigenenergies, the Berry phase accumulated during encircling, and the
eigenstate projection onto a basis state. Their associated topological
structures are analyzed using effective two-level models. These classifications
are further substantiated by numerical simulations in optical microcavities
with three scatterers, where EPs emerge in the complex frequency spectrum. By
encircling different EP pairs in parameter space, we demonstrate that the
resulting topological features such as trivial or non-trivial braiding and
Berry phase accumulation are directly linked to the vorticity structure and
eigenmode evolution. In particular, we show that the eigenstate projection onto
a basis state near EPs manifests as chiral optical modes in microcavities,
providing an experimentally accessible signature of the underlying topological
structure. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding multi-EP
topology and offer practical pathways toward their realization and control in
photonic systems.

Abstract: Plasmons facilitate a strong confinement and enhancement of near-field light,
offering exciting opportunities to enhance nonlinear optical responses at the
nanoscale. However, despite significant advancements, the electrically tunable
range of the nonlinear optical responses at nanometer-scale plasmonic
structures remains limited to a few percents per volt. Here, we transcend the
limitation of the nanometer regime by expanding the concept of electrophotonics
into angstrom-scale platform, enabling high-performance modulation of
near-field nonlinear optical responses inaccessible in prior architectures. We
demonstrate ~2000% enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) within 1 V
of voltage application by utilizing an angstrom-scale plasmonic gap between a
metallic tip and a flat metal substrate in a scanning tunneling microscope.
Extending this near-field SHG scheme to sum-frequency generation that is
accompanied by large frequency upconversion, we also found that such giant
electrical modulation of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena is
effective over mid-infrared to visible broad wavelength range. Our results and
concepts lay the foundation for developing near-field-based angstrom-scale
nonlinear electrophotonics with significant modulation depth at low driving

Conclusion: Semiconductor lasers offer accessible platform for time-crystal research, with potential for practical applications in photonic systems.

Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of discrete time-crystal phases
and crystallites in an actively mode-locked semiconductor laser. By tuning
either the bias current or the modulation frequency, the system undergoes a
spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from the harmonically mode-locked
state towards robust, highly coherent time-crystal states that persist
indefinitely. Two equivalent time-crystal configurations, shifted by one
driving period, can coexist as domains separated by sharp, long-lived
boundaries analogous to domain walls. The phenomenon is quantitatively
reproduced by a time-delayed model adapted to the large gain and losses of
semiconductor systems. Our findings demonstrate that mode-locked semiconductor
lasers offer a readily accessible platform to explore and control
non-equilibrium phases of light, enabling practical implementations of
time-crystal physics in photonic systems.

Abstract: Dual and multi-wavelength lasers, i.e., lasers with the ability to emit at
two or more wavelengths in a controlled fashion, represent an exciting new
twist in laser physics. Harnessing the mode competition to control them better
remains, however, a challenge. In this work, we numerically explore the effect
of optical feedback on the emission properties of a dual-wavelength laser using
a rate equation model. We focus on switching capability and investigate the
impact of key laser and feedback parameters. We connect the emergence of
simultaneous emission to a lower cross-saturation between modes, and
demonstrate that robust switching can be achieved using a short feedback cavity
and a sufficiently strong feedback. In particular and in contrast to previous
publications, we highlight that the feedback phase difference between the two
modes is not a critical parameter. Our results are consistent with recent
experimental observations, supporting the relevance of feedback-based control
techniques for multi-wavelength lasers.

hybrid FEM-circuit modelling. Additionally, we implement a low-pass filter as a

confirm high fidelity between simulated and analytical models, supporting the
viability of DRT resonators for reconfigurable photonic circuits. We believe
that the proposed DRT resonator building blocks have the potential to
complement and integrate with other previously reported blocks, thereby
enhancing the fidelity and expanding the application scope of programmable
photonic integrated circuits, particularly for all-optical signal processing in
communication systems and for integration within microwave photonics platforms

Abstract: Quantum emitters operating at telecom wavelengths are essential for the
advancement of quantum technologies, particularly in the development of
integrated on-chip devices for quantum computing, communication, and sensing.
Coupling resonant structures to a near-zero-index (NZI) environment has been
shown to enhance their optical performance by both increasing spontaneous
emission rates and improving emission directionality. In this work, we
comparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell)
quantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two
different sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the
epsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO)
substrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the
epsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence
lifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a
relative emission cone narrowing from 17.6{\deg} to 10.3{\deg}. These results
underline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the
spectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the
potential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration
into next-generation quantum photonic devices. Due to their CMOS compatibility,
fabrication tunability, and high thermal and optical damage thresholds, TCO NZI
materials offer a robust platform for scalable and high-performance quantum
optical systems operating within the telecom bandwidth.

Motivation: The study of caustics in charged particle microscopes could lead to improvements in their design and functionality.

Method: Catastrophe theory is applied to analyze caustic topologies in charged particle microscopes.

Result: Universal mathematical relationships between aberration coefficients are discovered, making the complexity of optical trajectories more manageable.

Conclusion: This approach opens possibilities for future developments in aberration theory for ion-based devices and corrected optical systems.

Abstract: This paper explores the topologies of caustics observed in instruments that
employ charged particles, such as electron and ion microscopes. These
geometrical figures are studied here using catastrophe theory. The application
of this geometrical theory to our optical situation has enabled us to
analytically reproduce the behaviours of various caustics. The interest lies
mainly in the universal nature of these results since our treatment requires no
prior knowledge of the optical configuration, but only a smart definition of
the control space. This universal approach has finally made it possible to
extract mathematical relationships between the aberration coefficients of any
optical system, which were hidden by the complexity of optical trajectories but
revealed by the set of catastrophes in the control space. These results provide
a glimpse for future applications of caustics in the development of new
corrected optical systems, especially for ions-based devices.

TL;DR: A new method for uplink pre-compensation in optical communication links uses downlink wavefront sensor data for atmospheric disturbance compensation, showing 8.6 times improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical communication links face challenges with atmospheric turbulence affecting signal quality. Up link pre-compensation is crucial for maintaining reliable communication, especially in ground-to-satellite links where wavefront errors are common.

Method: The method leverages existing downlink wavefront sensors to measure the downlink beam, using these measurements to tomographically reconstruct atmospheric conditions common to both the downlink beam and the ground station's field of view.

Result: The simulation results show that this method significantly reduces residual mean-square wavefront errors compared to direct downlink phase-based pre-compensation, offering a hardware-efficient solution.

Conclusion: This innovative approach provides an effective and cost-efficient method for uplink pre-compensation, improving communication reliability in challenging atmospheric conditions.

Abstract: Uplink pre-compensation in ground-to-satellite optical links remains a
problem, with an appropriate measurement of the wavefront error in the uplink
path often not being available. We present a method that uses successive
measurements of the readily accessible downlink beam to perform a tomographic
reconstruction of the volume of atmosphere common to the downlink beam and the
ground-station field-of-view. These measurements are done through the existing
downlink wavefront sensor. From here, an estimate of the wavefront error along
the uplink path can be obtained. We evaluate this method in simulation over
representative atmospheric conditions and find good performance, especially for
situations where the satellite point-ahead angle is many times greater than the
atmosphere's isoplanatic angle. Compared to pre-compensation directly using the
downlink phase, we find that this method estimates the uplink path with a
residual mean-square wavefront error that is up to 8.6 times less. The hardware
simplicity of this method makes it a promising solution for uplink
pre-compensation implementations targeted at optical communications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel monolithic active pixel sensor, HitPix3, designed for ion beam monitoring in high-voltage applications, highlighting its improved accuracy and radiation tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of particle therapy and the demand for precise beam monitoring, especially in challenging radiation environments, motivated the development of this sensor.

Method: The sensor was designed and tested using advanced CMOS technology on a 180 nm process with specific features optimized for ion beams, including a large sensor area and in-pixel amplification enhancements.

Result: Laboratory tests confirmed the sensor's functionality and performance, establishing it as a key step in ion beam monitoring technology.

Conclusion: HitPix3 represents a significant advancement in ion beam monitoring, offering enhanced capabilities for clinical particle therapy applications.

Abstract: Particle therapy is a well-established clinical treatment of tumors and so
far, more than one hundred centers are in operation around the world. High
accuracy on position and dose rate in beam monitoring are major cornerstones of
clinical success in particle therapy. A high voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic
active pixel sensor was developed for this beam monitoring system. The HV-CMOS
technology has demonstrated many advantages over other technologies in dealing
with radiation tolerance. This HV-CMOS sensor was produced with a 180 nm
commercial technology on high-resistivity substrate. The HitPix sensor features
several specific design details for operation in a high-intensity ion beam
environment: hit-counting pixels, on-sensor projection calculation, radiation
tolerant design and frame-based readout. It has a 9775 $\mu$m $\times$ 10110
$\mu$m sensor area with 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m pixel size. The new
HitPix3 has a number of improvements, including a modified in-pixel amplifier,
on-sensor calculation of beam profile projection in two dimensions, and
in-pixel threshold tuning capacity. The functionality of these features was
confirmed in laboratory tests of unirradiated HitPix3 sensors, making the
HitPix3 an important step in developing a sensor for use in ion beam
monitoring.

Abstract: The combination of low temperature and low vibration levels is key for
ultrasensitive sensing applications such as scanning probe microscopy,
large-mass quantum mechanics, and gravitational wave detection. Unfortunately,
closed-cycle cryostats using pulse tube or GM coolers introduce strong
low-frequency vibrations starting at 1 Hz. Mass-spring systems allow passive
isolation, but for low-frequency applications the required spring constants and
masses become impractical. Blade-based geometric anti-spring systems are
compact isolators that operate from sub-Hz frequencies, but have not been
demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we characterize a geometric
anti-spring system tuned to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Our cryogenic
filter uses radially arranged titanium blade springs whose effective spring
constant can be tuned in-situ using a magnetic actuator. Our system achieves a
vertical resonance frequency of 185 mHz at 7K, which allows reduction of
vibrations at the problematic 1 Hz cooler frequency by an order of magnitude.

TL;DR: High luminosity LHC requires 21000 si wafers p Rogers with LGADs. Radians analyzed and characterized via TCT and capacitance measurements for radiation hardness as per ATLAS-HGTD project


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to establish reliable quality control methods for high luminosity LHC detectors, specifically focusing on radiation hardness of sil front-end sensors, crucial for maintaining system integrity under extreme conditions.

Method: The methodology involved fabricating a test structure from each wafer, introducing neutron irradiation, and utilizing the Transient Current Technique (TCT) in the interface region of two LGAD devices. Additionally, capacitance-voltage and charge collection measurements with 90Sr were performed to calibrate TCT results and assess sensor parameters.

Result: The TCT technique successfully extracted key sensor parameters, including gain layer depletion voltage, bias voltage dependency, leakage current, and interpad distance. Capacitance-voltage measurements and 90Sr charge tests provided calibration and acceptance criteria for wafer radiation hardness, enhancing the overall quality control process for ATLAS-HGTD.

Conclusion: The presents method provides a comprehensive and efficient way to characterize the radiation hardness of high-end si wafers for the ATLAS-HGTD project, ensuring reliable performance under high radiation environments at the LHC.

Abstract: Production of the High Granularity Timing Detector for the ATLAS experiment
at High Luminosity LHC requires over 21000 silicon sensors based on Low Gain
Avalanche Diode (LGAD) technology. Their radiation hardness is monitored as a
part of the production quality control. Dedicated test structures from each
wafer are irradiated with neutrons and a fast and comprehensive
characterization is required. We introduce a new test method based on Transient
Current Technique (TCT) performed in the interface region of two LGAD devices.
The measurement enables extraction of numerous sensor performance parameters,
such as LGAD gain layer depletion voltage, LGAD gain dependence on bias
voltage, sensor leakage current and effective interpad distance. Complementary
capacitance-voltage measurements and charge collection measurements with 90Sr
on the same samples have been performed to calibrate the TCT results in terms
of charge collection and define acceptance criteria for wafer radiation
hardness in the ATLAS-HGTD project.

Abstract: This study presents the development and validation of a compact device for
measuring the water attenuation length (WAL), utilizing photomultiplier tubes
(PMTs), optical fibers, and LEDs. An 8 m water tank and the device was
constructed and validated in the laboratory. The device is capable of measuring
WAL values up to 50 m. The stray light was blocked mainly by a custom-designed
shutter. Toy Monte Carlo simulations were employed to evaluate the measurement
uncertainty, which was found to be within reasonable limits. These simulations
further indicate that the uncertainty can be reduced and more accurately
predicted for a larger-scale device with a length of 30 m. Real-time monitoring
was achieved by integrating the device into a water purification circulation
system, providing a practical, scalable solution for WAL measurement in future
large-scale water Cherenkov detectors.

### [80] [New results from fast timing iLGAD sensor on Timepix4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09308)
*Daan Oppenhuis*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The study investigates the performance of a 55 μm pitch iLGAD sensor integrated with a Timepix4 ASIC in the HL-LHC. The sensor demonstrates excellent timing resolution (377 ± 7 ps) after corrections. Active measurements such as grazing angle simulations reveal its capability to achieve perpendicular time resolution of 750 ps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing luminosity of the HL-LHC necessitates faster pixel tracking, requiring sensors with sub nanosecond timing resolution. Traditional avalanche detectors are not fast enough; hence, the exploration of alternatives like the iLGAD sensor.

Method: The iLGAD sensor, measuring 55 μm pitch and 2 cm² area, was tested in both the lab and during beam tests at CERN's SPS. The Timepix4 ASIC provides 195 ps time binning per pixel. The sensor's gain and efficiency were measured using radioactive sources. Timing resolution evaluation involved simulations and corrections, including timewalk and clock adjustments.

Result: The iLGAD sensor achieves high efficiency (99.6 ± 0.1%) and a baseline time resolution of 750 ps. Post clock and timewalk corrections, resolution improves to 377 ± 7 ps, demonstrating effective performance in challenging high-luminosity environments.

Conclusion: This work validates the iLGAD sensor as a reliable and efficient option for high-luminosity scenarios. The sensor's consistent performance, particularly in beam tests, supports its integration into future collider applications for enhanced timing accuracy.

Abstract: With the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) the number of
collisions per bunch crossing increases. To cope with these high rates in the
pixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the
need for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one
of the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the
results of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55
\textmu m, a thickness of 250~\textmu m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump
bonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and
therefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised
with radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the
CERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The
telescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\pm$
0.1~\textmu m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an
efficiency of 99.6 $\pm$ 0.1\%. Without any corrections the obtained time
resolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time
resolution becomes 377 $\pm$ 7~ps. Grazing angle measurements have been done,
which allow to measure the time resolution as function of depth of the charge
deposition in the sensor. This provides more insight for the perpendicular time
resolution.

Motivation: 研究目标是开发高效率的碲-Te-LS，而碲醇是其关键成分。高效率和长寿命在scintillator中至关重要，特别是对于物理学实验如零中微子双β衰变。为了优化碲-Te-LS的制备，开发常温下的合成方法是关键。

Method: 该研究通过在常温下使用碲酸与二醇在甲醇中直接反应，发现了甲醇具备催化作用，同时使用胺催化剂作为稳定剂。该方法具有能耗低、可靠性和高 scalibility，且不需要高温。

Result: 合成的碲醇具备高光学透明度（ΔAbs（430nm）≤ 0.0003 /1% Te），这在碲液 scintillator中是罕见的。Te-LS展示了超过一年的光谱稳定性和与传统方法相当的产光性能。这些都是革命性的进展，支持了克莱姆斯实验室的术语用于高灵敏度实验。

Conclusion: 该研究解决了碲-Te-LS的催化剂活性问题，通过常温下的新方法实现了高效合成。这种方法具有环保和高度可扩展性，为碲-Te-LS的大型生产奠定了基础，特别是在零中微子双β衰变实验中的应用将极大提升探测效率。

Abstract: This study establishes an innovative room-temperature synthesis approach for
tellurium-diol (Te-diol) compounds, which are crucial components in
tellurium-loaded liquid scintillator (Te-LS). The synthesis involves the direct
reaction of telluric acid with diols (e.g., 1,2-hexanediol) in methanol under
ambient conditions (20$\pm$5{\deg}C) , with the key features of lower energy
consumption, enhanced safety, and improved scalability. Mechanistic studies
reveal that methanol serves not merely as a solvent but also as a catalyst,
playing a critical role in the room-temperature synthesis. The organic amine
N,N-dimethyldodecylamine demonstrates dual functionality as both catalyst and
stabilizer. The Te-diol compounds enable fabrication of high-performance Te-LS
exhibiting exceptional optical transparency ($\Delta Abs$(430nm) $\leq$ 0.0003
per 1% Te loading), achieving long-term spectral stability exceeding or
approaching one year for both 1% and 3% Te formulations, and demonstrating a
light yield comparable to that achieved by the azeotropic distillation method.
The developed protocol offers a green, efficient alternative for large-scale
Te-LS production, particularly valuable for next-generation neutrinoless
double-beta decay experiments.

Abstract: We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the
minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum
spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the
existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this
method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$
ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the
$J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed.
In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host
significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations
stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend
conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in
close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group
calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its
potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.

Abstract: Low-energy emergent and emanant symmetries can be anomalous, higher-group, or
non-invertible. Such symmetries are systematically captured by topological
orders in one higher dimension, known as symmetry topological orders (symTOs).
Consequently, identifying the emergent or emanant symmetry of a system is not
simply a matter of determining its group structure, but rather of computing the
corresponding symTO. In this work, we develop a method to compute the symTO of
1+1D systems by analyzing their low-energy spectra under closed boundary
conditions with all possible symmetry twists. Applying this approach, we show
that the gapless antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model
possesses an exact emanant symTO corresponding to the $D_8$ quantum double,
when restricted to the $\mathbb{Z}_2^x \times \mathbb{Z}_2^z$ subgroup of the
$SO(3)$ spin-rotation symmetry and lattice translations. Moreover, the AF phase
exhibits an emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, whose exact components are described
jointly by the symTO and the $SO(3)$ spin-rotations. Using condensable algebras
in symTO, we further identify several neighboring phases accessible by
modifying interactions among low-energy excitations: (1) a gapped dimer phase,
connected to the AF phase via an $SO(4)$ rotation, (2) a commensurate collinear
ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with a $\omega \sim
k^2$ mode, (3) an incommensurate, translation-symmetric ferromagnetic phase
featuring both $\omega \sim k^2$ and $\omega \sim k$ modes, connected to the
previous phase by an $SO(4)$ rotation, and (4) an incommensurate ferromagnetic
phase that breaks translation by one site with both $\omega \sim k^2$ and
$\omega \sim k$ modes.

Abstract: Band renormalizations comprise crucial insights for understanding the
intricate roles of electron-boson coupling and electron correlation in emergent
phenomena such as superconductivity. In this study, by combining
high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical
calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the
trilayer nickelate superconductor $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ at ambient pressure. We
reveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of
$La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy
scale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by
electron correlation effect enhanced by Hund coupling. The resultant
waterfall-like dispersions resemble the high-energy kinks in cuprate
superconductors. However, at low energy scales of tens of meV, the dispersive
bands are nearly featureless and devoid of any resolvable electron-boson
interactions, in drastic contrast to the low-energy kinks observed in cuprates
and other correlated 3d transition-metal compounds. The dichotomic band
renormalizations highlight the disparity between nickelate and cuprate
superconductors and emphasize the importance of strong electron-correlation in
the superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates.

Motivation: Anisotropic quantum magnetism in complex spin systems is a fascinating area of research, and the realization of such a model offers a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena.

Method: The method involves realizing the hexagonal-plaquette chain with Ising anisotropy, analyzing the specific heat at zero field, and mapping the system to an effective spin-1/2 Ising-like chain.

Result: The specific heat reveals a phase transition at 1.0 K, showing a sharp peak. The anisotropy suppresses the spinon continuum, supporting an excitation gap and discrete excitations similar to the Zeeman ladder physics in related 1D Ising-like systems.

Conclusion: This work introduces a well-defined model system for studying correlated spin phenomena in anisotropic magnets and suggests a route for engineering Ising-like quantum states in molecular-based materials.

Abstract: We present the realization of a spin-1/2 hexagonal-plaquette chain with Ising
anisotropy, an unexplored quantum spin model that serves as a platform for
investigating anisotropic quantum magnetism. Specific heat at zero field
reveals a sharp peak at $T_{\rm{N}}$ = 1.0 K, indicating a phase transition to
a N$\acute{\rm{e}}$el order stabilized by interchain couplings. A perturbative
analysis maps the system onto an effective spin-1/2 Ising-like chain,
supporting the presence of an anisotropy-induced excitation gap. Furthermore,
the interchain interactions may induce discrete excitations in the spinon
continuum, reminiscent of Zeeman ladder physics observed in related 1D

Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelate superconductors are typically synthesized as thin

surface and interface layers in contact with the vacuum and substrate,
respectively. Here, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical
mean-field theory to investigate how electronic correlations influence these
surface and interface regions. Our results show that electronic correlations
can significantly modify the electronic structure, even driving surface layers
into a Mott-insulating state with a 3$d^8$ electronic configuration. Moreover,
surface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\Gamma$
and $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound
NdNiO$_2$. Finally, for an $n$-type interface, often synthesized
experimentally, we find the Ti 3$d$ orbitals to become electron doped.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetization and the magnetostriction of the

the magnetization curves observed with the magnetic field applied along all the
principal axes ([100], [110], and [111]) exhibit a magnetic hysteresis below
around 300 mK. In addition, a kink-like feature is observed in the
magnetization under B || [111], at which the magnetostriction also shows a
convex field dependence. Our classical Monte-Carlo and quantum exact
diagonalization calculations demonstrate that these features in the
magnetization are well reproduced by the spin Hamiltonian with a dominant
interaction between the octupole moments and with a QSI ground state,
indicating the emergence of a dipole-octupole QSI in this compound.

Abstract: We study the classical dipole-octupole pyrochlore spin systems in an external
magnetic field along the $[111]$ direction. We identify an intermediate
fragmented spin liquid phase that precedes full spin saturation, characterized
by the coexistence of three phenomena: U(1) spin liquid on the Kagome planes,
spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking, and partial spin polarization
from explicit symmetry breaking. We show that even without dipolar
interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the
octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow
pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks. We
discuss how these discoveries are directly relevant to various experiments on

work, we systematically classify one dimensional bosonic symmetry protected
topological phases protected respecting multipole symmetries by employing
matrix product state formalism. The symmetry action induces projective
representations at the ends of an open chain, which we identify via group
cohomology. In particular, for $r$-pole symmetries, for instance, $r$ = 0
(global), 1 (dipole), and 2 (quadrupole), the classification is determined by
distinct components of second cohomology groups that encode the boundary
projective representations.

Abstract: Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal
dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain
notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a
powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated
within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum
conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground
states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands
and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By
evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution,
we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including
charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi
liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for
understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated
materials.

TL;DR: Discovery of a rare ultra-strong coupling material in the EI family of Ta2Ni(Se,S)5 supports the role of inelastic electron-phonon interactions in phase transitions of intrinsic excitonic insulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether intrinsic excitonic insulators (EI) exist is a long-standing problem in condensed matter physics. The search for EI has been confounded by coexisting electron-phonon coupling, making it difficult to distinguish their ground states from other structural instabilities. If EI's excited states can reveal their nature through phonon signatures, this could provide a way to resolve this long-standing secret.

Method: Used neutron scattering to study the phonon spectrum of Ta2NiSe5 and its isostructural derivative Ta2NiS5 in both the normal and symmetry-broken states. They observed extremely anisotropic phonon broadening and softening in the semimetallic normal state, but not in the broken symmetry states. They compared phonon lifetimes in BCS and BEC limits to infer the nature of the phase transition.

Result: Observed that the phase transition in the Ta2Ni(Se,S)5 family is closely related to strong interband electron-phonon coupling. Experimentally determined a dimensionless coupling $rac{g}{
u_0} 	ilde{} 10$, making Ta2Ni(Se,S)5 a rare ultra-strong coupling material.

Conclusion: This work experimentally demonstrates that inelastic electron-phonon interactions can lead to phase transitions in intrinsic excitonic insulators. The ultra-strong coupling nature of Ta2Ni(Se,S)5 establishes a new class of EI materials that can be explored experimentally.

Abstract: The search for intrinsic excitonic insulators (EI) has long been confounded
by coexisting electron-phonon coupling in bulk materials. Although the ground
state of an EI may be difficult to differentiate from density-wave orders or
other structural instabilities, excited states offer distinctive signatures.
One way to provide clarity is to directly inspect the phonon spectral function
for long wavelength broadening due to phonon interaction with the high velocity
EI phason. Here, we report that the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) EI
candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ shows extremely anisotropic phonon broadening and
softening in the semimetallic normal state. In contrast, such a behavior is
completely absent in the broken symmetry state of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and in the
isostructural Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, where the latter has a fully gapped normal state.
By contrasting the expected phonon lifetimes in the BCS and BEC limits of a
putative EI, our results suggest that the phase transition in
Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ family is closely related to strong interband
electron-phonon coupling. We experimentally determine the dimensionless
coupling $\frac{g}{\omega_0}\sim10$, showing Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ as a rare
"ultra-strong coupling" material.

Abstract: A wide range of strongly correlated electron systems exhibit strange
metallicity, and they are increasingly recognized as in proximity to
correlation-driven localization-delocalization transitions. A prototype setting
arises in heavy fermion metals, where the proximity to the electron
localization is manifested as Kondo destruction. Here we show that the Kondo
destruction quantum critical point is linked to the phenomenon of fixed point
annihilation. This connection reveals the absence of residual entropy density
at the quantum critical point and, thus, its thermodynamic stability. Broader
implications of our results are discussed.

Conclusion: 本文通过精确解方法，系统研究了有限大小自旋-1/2链中两Magnon束缚态的形成和存在条件，为量子多体系统的研究提供了新的见解。

Abstract: The two-magnon problem in the $k=-\pi/2$ sector of a \emph{finite-size}
spin-1/2 chain with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $(J_1>0)$
and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $(J_2<0)$ and
anisotropy parameters $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ is solved exactly by combining
a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states and a plane-wave ansatz. Two types of
two-magnon bound states (BSs), i.e., the NN and NNN exchange BSs, are revealed.
We establish a phase diagram in the $J_1/(|J_2|\Delta_2)$-$\Delta_1$ plane
where regions supporting different types of BSs are analytically identified. It
is found that no BSs exist (the two types of BSs coexist) when both $\Delta_1$
and $\Delta_2$ are small (large) enough. Our results for the isotropic case
$\Delta_1=\Delta_2=1$ are consistent with an early work [Ono I, Mikado S and

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian,
one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass
identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the
vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own
anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily
pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a
serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge
in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical
thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite
the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and
superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the routes to chaos is fundamental in nonlinear dynamics, with potential applications in sensing and information processing.

Method: The authors experimentally demonstrate the phenomenon using an optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator, varying system parameters to observe transitions from periodic to chaotic motion.

Result: Intermittent chaos is observed, acts as a noise source, and enhances nonlinear ultrasonic detection.

Conclusion: This work deepens the understanding of chaos formation and broadens its applications in sensing and information processing.

Abstract: Chaos is a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics, manifesting as
irregular and unpredictable behavior across various physical systems. Among the
diverse routes to chaos, intermittent chaos is a distinct transition pathway,
characterized by the temporal or spatial alternation between periodic and
chaotic motions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time,
optomechanically induced intermittent chaos in an optical
whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. Specifically, the system evolves from
stable periodic oscillation through an intermittent-chaos regime before fully
developing into chaotic motion. As system parameters vary, the proportion of
chaotic motion in the time-domain increases asymptotically until chaotic
dynamics dominates entirely. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that,
intermittent chaos can act as noise of a favorable intensity compared with
purely periodic or fully chaotic states, and enhance rather than reduce
system's responses in nonlinear ultrasonic detection. These findings not only
deepen the comprehensive understanding of chaos formation but also broaden its
potential applications in high-precision sensing and information processing.

Abstract: Performing large-scale, accurate quantum simulations of many-fermion systems
is a central challenge in quantum science, with applications in chemistry,
materials, and high-energy physics. Despite significant progress, realizing
generic fermionic algorithms with qubit systems incurs significant space-time
overhead, scaling as O(N) for N fermionic modes. Here we present a method for
faster fermionic simulation with asymptotic space-time overhead of O(log(N)) in
the worst case, and O(1) for circuits with additional structure, including
important subroutines like the fermionic fast Fourier transform. This
exponential reduction is achieved by using reconfigurable quantum systems with
non-local connectivity, mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedforward, to
generate dynamical fermion-to-qubit mappings. We apply this technique to
achieve efficient compilation for key simulation tasks, including Hamiltonian
simulation of the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and periodic materials, as
well as free-fermion state-preparation. Moreover, we show that the algorithms
themselves can be adapted to use only the O(1)-overhead structures to further
reduce resource overhead. These techniques can lower gate counts by orders of
magnitude for practical system sizes and are natively compatible with error
corrected computation, making them ideal for early fault-tolerant quantum
devices. Our results tightly bound the computational gap between fermionic and
qubit models and open new directions in quantum simulation algorithm design and
implementation.

Abstract: Measurements are essential for the processing and protection of information
in quantum computers. They can also induce long-range entanglement between
unmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many
non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and
using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new
approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create
short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a
superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range
entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the
others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on
observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by
correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced
entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability
of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely
related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work
can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more
general problems in quantum control.

Abstract: The advent of quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of the

paradigm dominated by intrinsic randomness and quantum correlations. This shift
has not only enabled groundbreaking technologies, such as quantum sensors,
networks and computers, but has also unlocked entirely new possibilities for
artistic expressions. In this paper, we explore the intersection of quantum
mechanics and art, focusing on the use of quantum entanglement and inherent
randomness as creative tools. Specifically, we present The Sound of
Entanglement, a live musical performance driven by real-time measurements of
entangled photons in a Bell test. By integrating the measured quantum
correlations as a central compositional element and synchronizing live visuals
with experimental data, the performance offers a unique and unrepeatable
audiovisual experience that relies on quantum correlations which cannot be
produced by any classical device. Through this fusion of science and art, we
aim to provide a deeper appreciation of quantum phenomena while expanding the
boundaries of creative expression.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of trapped ion clocks to probe relativistic effects and introduces new time dilation effects that require a quantum description of proper time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in atomic clocks have enabled precise measurements of relativistic effects, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of time and space.

Method: The authors employ a Hamiltonian formalism to analyze trapped clock atoms, deriving time dilation effects such as second-order Doppler shifts, squeezing, and quantum corrections, and demonstrate proper time interferometry in state-of-the-art clocks.

Result: Experiments with trapped ion clocks reveal phenomena where classical proper time descriptions are insufficient, marking a significant step toward quantum descriptions of time evolution.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for exploring relativistic effects in clocks, potentially leading to advancements in quantum timekeeping and fundamental physics.).

Abstract: Optical clocks based on atoms and ions probe relativistic effects with
unprecedented sensitivity by resolving time dilation due to atom motion or
different positions in the gravitational potential through frequency shifts.
However, all measurements of time dilation so far can be explained effectively
as the result of dynamics with respect to a classical proper time parameter.
Here we show that atomic clocks can probe effects where a classical description
of the proper time dynamics is insufficient. We apply a Hamiltonian formalism
to derive time dilation effects in harmonically trapped clock atoms and show
how second-order Doppler shifts (SODS) due to the vacuum energy (vSODS),
squeezing (sqSODS) and quantum corrections to the dynamics (qSODS) arise. We
also demonstrate that the entanglement between motion and clock evolution can
become observable in state-of-the-art clocks when the motion of the atoms is
strongly squeezed, realizing proper time interferometry. Our results show that
experiments with trapped ion clocks are within reach to probe relativistic
evolution of clocks for which a quantum description of proper time becomes
necessary.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the amount of energy that can be extracted or
charged through unitary operations when only minimal information about the
state is known. Assuming knowledge of only the mean energy of the state, we
start by developing optimal upper bounds for the work that can be unitarily
extracted or charged in this scenario. In deriving these upper bounds, we
provide a complete characterization of the minimum ergotropy and anti-ergotropy
for density matrices with fixed average energy, showing that the minimum states
are always passive or antipassive and the problem of finding them can be mapped
to a simple linear programming algorithm. Furthermore, we show that these lower
bounds directly translate into upper bounds for the energy-constrained coherent
ergotropy and anti-ergotropy of a state. We continue by illustrating scenarios
in which these bounds can be saturated: a simple unitary protocol is shown to
saturate the bounds for relevant classes of Hamiltonians, while having access
to decoherence or randomness as resources, the saturation is guaranteed for all
Hamiltonians. Finally, by taking a qutrit as an example, we show and compare
the performances of the various protocols identified.

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of continuous-time, time-inhomogeneous
Markovian quantum dynamics in a stationary random environment. Under mild
faithfulness and eventually positivity-improving assumptions, the normalized
evolution converges almost surely to a stationary family of full-rank states,
and the normalized propagators converge almost surely to a rank-one family
determined by these states. Beyond a disorder-dependent threshold, these
convergences occur at exponential rates that may depend on the disorder; when
the environment is ergodic, the rate itself is deterministic. When the
dynamical propagators display vanishing maximal temporal stochastic
correlation, convergence in stochastic expectations for the above limits is
faster than any power of the time separation, and improves to exponential rates
when the dynamical propagators display stochastically independent increments.
These expectation bounds yield disorder-uniform high-probability estimates. The
framework does not require complete positivity or trace preservation and
encompasses random Lindbladian evolutions and collision-model dynamics.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子纠错体系提供了新的安全保障，适用于复杂量子计算场景。

Abstract: In adversarial settings, where attackers can deliberately and strategically
corrupt quantum data, standard quantum error correction reaches its limits. It
can only correct up to half the code distance and must output a unique answer.
Quantum list decoding offers a promising alternative. By allowing the decoder
to output a short list of possible errors, it becomes possible to tolerate far
more errors, even under worst-case noise. But two fundamental questions remain:
which quantum codes support list decoding, and can we design decoding schemes
that are secure against efficient, computationally bounded adversaries? In this
work, we answer both. To identify which codes are list-decodable, we provide a
generalized version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Then, using tools from
quantum cryptography, we build an unambiguous list decoding protocol based on
pseudorandom unitaries. Our scheme is secure against any quantum
polynomial-time adversary, even across multiple decoding attempts, in contrast
to previous schemes. Our approach connects coding theory with complexity-based
quantum cryptography, paving the way for secure quantum information processing
in adversarial settings.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Classical response functions are promising for 2D IR modeling, but nonlinear responses and bath-induced stabilization need better understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding nonlinear classical response functions and their stabilization by system-bath interactions is important for advancing 2D IR spectroscopy modeling.

Method: The study extends a diagrammatic approach from isolated classical systems to include system-bath interactions under the weak-anharmonicity approximation. The resulting weakly anharmonic response function is analyzed and compared to the quantum counterpart.

Result: The classical response function is simpler and has a clear connection to the quantum limit. Bath-induced stabilization of both linear and nonlinear responses depends significantly on the spectral density balance between low and high frequencies.

Conclusion: This work suggests that the classical diagrammatic approach can be useful for modeling 2D IR spectroscopy of real experimental systems at ambient temperatures by incorporating bath effects.

Abstract: Classical response functions have shown considerable promise in computational
2D IR modeling; however, a simple diagrammatic description, analogous to that
for open quantum systems, has been lacking. While a promising diagrammatic
approach has recently been introduced for isolated systems, the resulting
nonlinear response functions remain unstable at long times, a characteristic
feature of integrable classical systems. Here, we extend this framework to
incorporate system-bath interactions under the weak-anharmonicity approximation
and explore the resulting conditions for bath-induced stabilization. The
resulting expression for the weakly anharmonic response function is remarkably
simple and exhibits a one-to-one correspondence with the quantum counterpart in
the $\hbar\to 0$ limit, offering potential computational advantages in
extending the approach to large, multi-oscillator systems. We find that (to
lowest order in anharmonicity) the bath-induced stabilization of both linear
and nonlinear classical response functions depends sensitively on the nature of
spectral density, particularly on the balance between low-frequency and
high-frequency components. Application of this classical diagrammatic approach
to 2D IR spectroscopy of the amide I band captures the characteristic
population-time-dependent dynamics associated with spectral diffusion,
suggesting that the approach may prove useful in describing real experimental
systems at ambient temperatures.

Abstract: We study the capacity of a quantum channel for retrocausal communication,
where messages are transmitted backward in time, from a sender in the future to
a receiver in the past, through a noisy postselected closed timelike curve
(P-CTC) represented by the channel. We completely characterize the one-shot
retrocausal quantum and classical capacities of a quantum channel, and we show
that the corresponding asymptotic capacities are equal to the average and sum,
respectively, of the channel's max-information and its regularized Doeblin
information. This endows these information measures with a novel operational
interpretation. Furthermore, our characterization can be generalized beyond
quantum channels to all completely positive maps. This imposes
information-theoretic limits on transmitting messages via
postselected-teleportation-like mechanisms with arbitrary initial- and
final-state boundary conditions, including those considered in various
black-hole final-state models.

TL;DR: This paper discusses quantum sensing with solid-state spin defects, focusing on optically addressable sensors in atomically thin 2D materials. They present an experimental framework for a 2D spin ensemble, mapping hyperfine interactions, demonstrating magnetic and electric sensing capabilities, and introducing noise spectrum reconstruction accounting for quantum control imperfections. They achieve a record coherence time of 80 μs and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at 10 nm target distance, paving the way for next-generation quantum sensors with enhanced sensitivity and tunable noise selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the need for nanoscale metrology with sub-wavelength spatial resolution and exceptional sensitivity to multiple signal types. Existing platforms like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have limitations, such as performance degradation near surfaces or in nanoscale volumes. This paper aims to address these limitations by developing optically addressable spin sensors in atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials.

Method: The authors present an experimental framework to probe a novel 2D spin ensemble. They use a central spin system in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal to map hyperfine interactions with proximal nuclear spins, demonstrate programmable switching between magnetic and electric sensing, and introduce a robust method for reconstructing the environmental noise spectrum while accounting for quantum control imperfections.

Result: The authors achieve a record coherence time of 80 μs and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at a 10 nm target distance. They successfully reach the threshold for detecting a single nuclear spin in nanoscale spectroscopy. Additionally, they leverage the broad opportunities for defect engineering in atomically thin hosts, providing a foundation for next-generation quantum sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity, tunable noise selectivity, and versatile quantum functionalities.

Conclusion: This paper makes significant progress toward realizing highly sensitive and versatile quantum sensors with optically addressable spin defects in atomically thin 2D materials. Their approach and results open up new avenues for advancing nanoscale metrology and quantum sensing technologies.

Abstract: Quantum sensing with solid-state spin defects has transformed nanoscale
metrology, offering sub-wavelength spatial resolution with exceptional
sensitivity to multiple signal types. Maximizing these advantages requires
minimizing both the sensor-target separation and detectable signalthreshold.
However, leading platforms such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond
suffer performance degradation near surfaces or in nanoscale volumes,
motivating the search for optically addressable spin sensors in atomically
thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present an experimental
framework to probe a novel 2D spin ensemble, including its Hamiltonian,
coherent sensing dynamics, and noise environment. Using a central spin system
in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal, we fully map the hyperfine
interactions with proximal nuclear spins, demonstrate programmable switching
between magnetic and electric sensing, and introduce a robust method for
reconstructing the environmental noise spectrum explicitly accounting for
quantum control imperfections. We achieve a record coherence time of 80 $\mu$s
and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at a 10 nm target distance,
reaching the threshold for detecting a single nuclear spin in nanoscale
spectroscopy. Leveraging the broad opportunities for defect engineering in
atomically thin hosts, these results lay the foundation for next-generation
quantum sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity, tunable noise selectivity, and
versatile quantum functionalities.

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide band gap, van der Waals material that
is highly promising for solid-state quantum technologies as a host of optically
addressable, paramagnetic spin defects. Intrinsic and extrinsic point defects
provide a range of emission energies, but the atomic-level structures related
to observed transitions are not fully characterised. In this work, intrinsic
point defects in bulk hBN are modelled using density functional theory at the
level of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA), considering
their formation energies, electronic spectra and magnetic properties. The
meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional r2SCAN is found to offer a balance
between accuracy and computational efficiency for specific properties, while
its predictive performance for bound-exciton stability is limited when compared
to higher-level hybrid functionals. This implies opportunities for its use in
optimised, hierarchical computational defect screening workflows. Under revised
criteria, VB-, BN0, Bi+ and Ni+ defects are identified as stable colour centres
with zero-phonon emission within technologically desirable wavelengths, making
them promising for use in quantum networks and sensors.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative machine learning, powered by massive
computational resources, have demonstrated unprecedented human-like
capabilities. While beyond-classical quantum experiments can generate samples
from classically intractable distributions, their complexity has thwarted all
efforts toward efficient learning. This challenge has hindered demonstrations
of generative quantum advantage: the ability of quantum computers to learn and
generate desired outputs substantially better than classical computers. We
resolve this challenge by introducing families of generative quantum models
that are hard to simulate classically, are efficiently trainable, exhibit no
barren plateaus or proliferating local minima, and can learn to generate
distributions beyond the reach of classical computers. Using a $68$-qubit
superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate these capabilities in two
scenarios: learning classically intractable probability distributions and
learning quantum circuits for accelerated physical simulation. Our results
establish that both learning and sampling can be performed efficiently in the
beyond-classical regime, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced
generative models with provable advantage.

Abstract: The photon blockade phenomenon, a promising tool for realizing efficient
single-photon sources, is the central focus of our work. We study this
phenomenon within the context of the multimode extension of the Jaynes-Cummings
model, incorporating two-photon dissipation and external coherent driving.
Operating in the weak-driving regime, we confine our analysis to the
two-excitation sector of the Hilbert space, initially exploring the single-mode
case and then focusing on the corresponding multimode problem. Our study
calculates the second-order correlation function (both numerically and
analytically) for zero- and nonzero time delays in single- and multimode cases,
to pinpoint and validate the conditions that lead to conventional and
unconventional photon blockade. Our zero delay findings reveal that photon
antibunching is comparable in both cases; however, the multimode case offers a
greater degree of control and applicability. Furthermore, for non-zero delay
operation, we find that when one of the multiple modes is set at the optimal
conventional photon blockade conditions, the behavior of the curve mimics the
single-mode problem with an overall slower rate of reaching the
$g^{(2)}(\tau)=1$ value. These results highlight the practical implications of
our findings for building useful single-photon sources.

Abstract: We present a novel graph-theoretic approach to simplifying generic many-body
Hamiltonians. Our primary result introduces a recursive twin-collapse
algorithm, leveraging the identification and elimination of symmetric vertex
pairs (twins), as well as line-graph modules, within the frustration graph of
the Hamiltonian. This method systematically block-diagonalizes Hamiltonians,
significantly reducing complexity while preserving the energetic spectrum.
Importantly, our approach expands the class of models that can be mapped to
non-interacting fermionic Hamiltonians (free-fermion solutions), thereby
broadening the applicability of classical solvability methods. Through
numerical experiments on spin Hamiltonians arranged in periodic lattice
configurations and Majorana Hamiltonians, we demonstrate that the twin-collapse
increases the identification of simplicial and claw-free graph structures,
which characterize free-fermion solvability. Finally, we extend our framework
by presenting a generalized discrete Stone-von Neumann theorem. This
comprehensive framework provides new insights into Hamiltonian simplification
techniques, free-fermion solutions, and group-theoretical characterizations
relevant for quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum
computation.

steps. Our fully quantum algorithm will be an important addition to the quantum
computational toolbox to tackle problems intractable on classical machines.

Motivation: Exploring new methods for creating and controlling quantum states is crucial for advancing quantum computing and simulations.

Method: Photonic structured baths, such as bilayer square lattices, are used with quantum emitters to induce quantum correlations and manipulate dressed states.

Result: The dressed states exhibit odd-neighbor, robust, and anisotropic properties when the emitters’ frequencies are in the middle of a bandgap. They can also be used to create edge and corner states in a generalized 2D SSH model.

Conclusion: This approach offers potential for innovative quantum many-body physics and versatile quantum systems in photonic or phononic structures.

Abstract: We investigate quantum emitters (QEs) interacting with a photonic structured
bath made of bilayer square lattices, where the resonance anti-crossing between
the energy bands opens a symmetric middle energy gap. Due to the intrinsic
chiral symmetry of the bath and interactions with the square-like band-edges,
the QE-photon dressed states generated in this inner bandgap are odd-neighbor,
robust, and anisotropic, when the emitters' transition frequencies lie in the
middle of the bandgap. We also use giant artificial atoms to engineer and
modify the dressed states' patterns. Exotic bound states can lead to spin
models with symmetry protection, resulting in fascinating many-body phases. As
an example, we show that this proposal can be used to generate both edge states
and corner states in the generalized 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This
work opens up new avenues for research into innovative quantum many-body

Abstract: Quantum walks, both discrete and continuous, serve as fundamental tools in
quantum information processing with diverse applications. This work introduces
a hybrid quantum walk model that integrates the coin mechanism of discrete
walks with the Hamiltonian-driven time evolution of continuous walks. Through
systematic analysis of probability distributions, standard deviations, and
entanglement entropy on fundamental graph structures (2-vertex circles, stars,
and lines), we reveal distinctive dynamical characteristics that differentiate
our model from conventional quantum walk paradigms. The proposed framework
demonstrates unifying capabilities by naturally encompassing existing quantum
walk models as special cases. Two significant applications emerge from this
hybrid architecture: (1) We develop a novel protocol for perfect state
transfer(PST) in general connected graphs, overcoming the limitations of
previous graph-specific approaches. A PST on a tree graph has been implemented
on a quantum superconducting processor. (2) We devise a quantum algorithm for
multiplying $K$ adjacency matrices of $n$-vertex regular graphs with time
complexity $O(n^2d_1\cdots d_K)$, outperforming classical matrix multiplication
$(O(n^{2.371552}))$ when vertex degrees $d_i$ are bounded. The algorithm's
efficacy for triangle counting is experimentally validated through the quantum

Abstract: Accurate computation of the Green's function is crucial for connecting
experimental observations to the underlying quantum states. A major challenge
in evaluating the Green's function in the time domain lies in the efficient
simulation of quantum state evolution under a given Hamiltonian-a task that
becomes exponentially complex for strongly correlated systems on classical
computers. Quantum computing provides a promising pathway to overcome this
barrier by enabling efficient simulation of quantum dynamics. However, for
near-term quantum devices with limited coherence times and fidelity, the deep
quantum circuits required to implement time-evolution operators present a
significant challenge for practical applications. In this work, we introduce an
efficient algorithm for computing Green's functions via Cartan decomposition,
which requires only fixed-depth quantum circuits for arbitrarily long time
simulations. Additionally, analytical gradients are formulated to accelerate
the Cartan decomposition by leveraging a unitary transformation in a factorized
form. The new algorithm is applied to simulate long-time Green's functions for
the Fermi-Hubbard and transverse-field Ising models, extracting the spectral
functions through Fourier transformation.

Abstract: Currency arbitrage leverages price discrepancies in currency exchange rates
across different currency pairs to gain risk-free profits. It involves multiple
trading, where short-lived price discrepancies require real-time, high-speed
processing of vast solution space, posing challenges for classical computing.
In this work, we formulate an enhanced mathematical model for the currency
arbitrage problem by adding simple cycle preservation constraints, which
guarantee trading cycle validity and eliminate redundant or infeasible
substructures. To solve this model, we use and benchmark various solvers,
including Quantum Annealing (QA), gate-based quantum approaches such as
Variational Quantum Algorithm with Adaptive Cost Encoding (ACE), as well as
classical solvers such as Gurobi and classical meta heuristics such as Tabu
Search (TS). We propose a classical multi-bit swap post-processing to improve
the solution generated by ACE. Using real-world currency exchange data, we
compare these methods in terms of both arbitrage profit and execution time, the
two key performance metrics. Our results give insight into the current
capabilities and limitations of quantum methods for real-time financial use

*Francesco Perciavalle,Nicola Lo Gullo,Francesco Plastina*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution to study how quantum coherence contributes to work extraction in cyclic quantum processes, especially in scenarios where traditional intuition suggests energy loss, but due to quasiprobability negativity, work can still be extracted. The framework is applied to qubits undergoing gate operations, identifying conditions for anomalous work exchanges and linking work statistics of complex circuits to their simpler components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work stems from the desire to understand the role of quantum coherence in thermodynamic processes, particularly in quantum computation. Traditional concepts often predict energy dissipation in certain processes, but quantum systems can exhibit non-classical behavior that defies these predictions. By leveraging the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution, the authors aim to provide a deeper understanding of how quantum resources, such as coherence, can be harnessed to achieve anomalous thermodynamic outcomes, which has significant implications for the development of quantum technologies.

Method: The authors employ the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution to quantify the contribution of coherence to work extraction in cyclic quantum processes. They analyze processes involving qubits undergoing sequences of single- and two-qubit gate operations. By examining the quasiprobability structure, they identify specific conditions under which anomalous work exchanges occur. Additionally, they establish a compositional relation that links the work statistics of complex quantum circuits to their constituent gates, enabling a systematic study of thermodynamic relevance in quantum computation.

Result: The key findings reveal that quantum coherence enables work extraction in scenarios where classical intuition would predict energy loss. The framework successfully identifies conditions for anomalous work exchanges and provides a compositional approach to analyze complex quantum circuits. This work not only deepens the theoretical understanding of quantum thermodynamics but also paves the way for designing quantum circuits that can harness coherence to achieve desired thermodynamic outcomes.,

Conclusion: This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of quantum thermodynamics by demonstrating how quantum coherence can be used to extract work in processes that defy classical intuition. Through the development of a novel framework based on the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution, the authors provide a systematic way to analyze and optimize quantum circuits for thermodynamic applications. The findings open new avenues for advancing quantum computation and thermodynamics.

Abstract: We develop a framework based on the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability
distribution to quantify the contribution of coherence to work extraction
during generic, cyclic quantum evolutions. In particular, we focus on
``anomalous processes'', counterintuitive scenarios in which, due to the
negativity of the quasiprobability distribution, work can be extracted, even
when individual processes are associated with energy gain. Applying this
framework to qubits undergoing sequences of single- and two-qubit gate
operations, we identify specific conditions under which such anomalous work
exchanges occur. Furthermore, we analyze the quasiprobabilistic structure of
deep quantum circuits and establish a compositional relation linking the work
statistics of full circuits to those of their constituent gates. Our work
highlights the role of coherence in the thermodynamics of quantum computation
and provides a foundation for systematically studying potential thermodynamic
relevance of specific quantum circuits.

Abstract: Linear operations, e.g., vector-matrix or vector-vector multiplications, are
core operations of modern neural networks. To diminish computational time,
these operations are implemented by parallel computations using different
coprocessors. In this work we show that open quantum system consisting of
bosonic modes and interacting with bosonic reservoirs can be used as analog
coprocessor implementing multiple vector-matrix multiplications with stochastic
matrices in parallel. Input vectors are encoded in occupancies of reservoirs,
and output result is presented by stationary energy flows. The operation takes
time needed for the system's transition to non-equilibrium stationary state
independently on number of the reservoirs, i.e., on the input vector dimension.
The computations are accompanied by entropy growth. We construct a direct
mapping between open quantum systems and electrical crossbar structures,
showing that dissipation rates multiplied by OQS's modes frequencies can be
seen as conductivities, reservoirs' occupancies can be seen as potentials, and
stationary energy flows can be seen as electric currents.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了环境辅助经典容量的概念，并展示了量子通道恢复编码能力的新可能性。

Abstract: For any quantum transmission line, with smaller output dimension than its
input, the number of classical symbols that can be reliably encoded is strictly
suboptimal. In other words, if the channel outputs a lesser number of symbols
than it intakes, then rest of the symbols eventually leak into the environment,
during the transmission. Can these lost symbols be recovered with minimal help
from the environment? While the standard notion of environment-assisted
classical capacity fails to fully capture this scenario, we introduce a
generalized framework to address this question. Using an elegant example, we
first demonstrate that the encoding capability of a quantum channel can be
optimally restored with a minimal assistance of environment, albeit possessing
suboptimal capacity in the conventional sense. Remarkably, we further prove
that even the strongest two-input-two-output non-signaling correlations between
sender and receiver cannot substitute for this assistance. Finally, we
characterize a class of quantum channels, in arbitrary dimensions, exhibiting a
sharp separation between the conventional environment-assisted capacity and the
true potential for unlocking their encoding strength.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that, for sudden quenches, the work distribution reduces to the
statistics of traces of powers of Haar unitaries, which are random unitary
matrices drawn uniformly from the unitary group. For translation-invariant
quadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and
periodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary
matrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the
form $W=\sum_{r\le m} a_r\,\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ (and in models with
pairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional
$b_r\,\mathrm{Im}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate
central limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian
distribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\mathrm{Var}(W)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_r
r\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers. We also
characterise the conditions under which non-Gaussian tails arise, for example
from many interaction terms or their slow decay, as well as the appearance of
Fisher--Hartwig singularities. We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain.
Various numerical diagnostics support the analytical results.

Motivation: It explores the sensitivity and robustness of interferometers.

Method: Mathematical modeling and phase analysis of atom interference.

Result: Interferometer is noise-robust in force measurements, but visibility degrades. Optimal trajectory solutions found.

Conclusion: These findings enhance interferometer reliability in real-world conditions.

Abstract: In a previous work, we designed a compact atom interferometer to measure
homogeneous constant forces guiding the arms via shortcuts to adiabatic paths.
Within this scheme we drive the atom by moving spin-dependent traps, and design
a force $f(t)$ to compensate inertial terms in the moving frame. In this paper
we analyze how robust our interferometer is against some realistic noisy
deviation from the unperturbed value of the force $f(t)$. The complex overlap
of the atom wave functions for each arm of the interferometer at the final time
of the process is calculated. We demonstrate that the measure of the unknown
force will not be affected, as there will be no contribution of the error in
the phase difference of the overlap. Nevertheless, the visibility will be
reduced as the modulus will no longer be one. In addition we find the optimal
trajectories minimizing the effect of the noise in the visibility while keeping
the sensitivity of the interferometer.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Energy-based generative models, such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
require unbiased Boltzmann samples for effective training. Classical Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods, however, converge slowly and yield correlated
samples, making large-scale training difficult. We address this bottleneck by
applying the analytic relation between annealing schedules and effective
inverse temperature in diabatic quantum annealing. By implementing this
prescription on a quantum annealer, we obtain temperature-controlled Boltzmann
samples that enable RBM training with faster convergence and lower validation
error than classical sampling. We further identify a systematic temperature
misalignment intrinsic to analog quantum computers and propose an analytical
rescaling method that mitigates this hardware noise, thereby enhancing the
practicality of quantum annealers as Boltzmann samplers. In our method, the
model's connectivity is set directly by the qubit connectivity, transforming
the computational complexity inherent in classical sampling into a requirement
on quantum hardware. This shift allows the approach to extend naturally from
RBMs to fully connected Boltzmann machines, opening opportunities inaccessible
to classical training methods.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by
generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat
reservoir as sink. Our model extends the four-stroke engine proposed by Yi and
coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] by introducing an
ergotropy-extracting stroke, resulting in a five-stroke cycle. For measurements
along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield
an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the
engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine (without
the adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine.
For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the
total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work
outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For
measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of
the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we
illustrate for specific cases (x-x and x-z directions), a definite ordering is
obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke
engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as
three-stroke counterparts.

Motivation:  advancing quantum-enhanced graph machine learning using neutral-atom devices.

Method:  Introducing attributed graph handling, new kernels (QEK, GDQC), and pooling via local observables.

Result:  QEK and GDQC perform competitively with classical algorithms, and pooling improves performance.

Conclusion:  Node-feature embedding and local observable-based kernel designs enhance quantum machine learning for graphs.

Abstract: We extend the quantum-feature kernel framework, which relies on measurements
of graph-dependent observables, along three directions. First, leveraging
neutral-atom quantum processing units (QPUs), we introduce a scheme that
incorporates attributed graphs by embedding edge features into atomic positions
and node features into local detuning fields of a Rydberg Hamiltonian. We
demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that local detuning enhances
kernel expressiveness. Second, in addition to the existing quantum evolution
kernel (QEK), which uses global observables, we propose the
generalized-distance quantum-correlation (GDQC) kernel, based on local
observables. While the two kernels show comparable performance, we show that
GDQC can achieve higher expressiveness. Third, instead of restricting to
observables at single time steps, we combine information from multiple stages
of the quantum evolution via pooling operations. Using extensive simulations on
two molecular benchmark datasets, MUTAG and PTC\_FM, we find: (a) QEK and GDQC
perform competitively with leading classical algorithms; and (b) pooling
further improves performance, enabling quantum-feature kernels to surpass
classical baselines. These results show that node-feature embedding and kernel
designs based on local observables advance quantum-enhanced graph machine
learning on neutral-atom devices.

Result: 我们得出结论，通用的协议在纯双分系统中，能否有效收敛依赖于源态的奠定了。如果我们有一批相同的纯状态，通过计算不会产生意外的错误，最终按照最佳协议执行。关键点是处理这种情况证据时，必须完全态；否则，可能出现错误的结论。关于收敛概率的问题，我们可以得出一个明确的计算公式来最大限度地提高整体效率。

Conclusion: 我们在纯双分系统中，对于利用两种源态初始化的协议，其收敛概率的最优值是 $O$。这一结果不仅为测试协议的有效性提供了新的基准，还为量子技术的很多时候实践中提供了重要的指导。这一步骤的严格证明或许可以扩展到更多资源或更大的量子系统。

Abstract: Entanglement purification is essential for quantum technologies; yet,
rigorous bounds on the success probability for universal protocols -- those
requiring no prior knowledge about the input state -- have remained
underexplored. We establish such fundamental limits for conclusive protocols
distilling perfect Bell states from a pure two-qubit states by deriving the
optimal success probability starting with: two copies of a state with known
Schmidt basis, and four copies of a state with unknown Schmidt basis. We prove
that a known protocol achieves these bounds, confirming its optimality.
Crucially, universality imposes an inherent efficiency trade-off, yielding an
average success probability of just $2/105$ over Haar measure.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient pricing of multi-asset basket options poses a

this work, we investigate the role of quantum-enhanced uncertainty modeling in
financial pricing options on real-world data. Specifically, we use quantum
amplitude estimation and analyze the impact of varying the number of
uncertainty qubits while keeping the number of assets fixed, as well as the
impact of varying the number of assets while keeping the number of uncertainty
qubits fixed. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we establish and validate
a hybrid quantum-classical comparison framework, benchmarking quantum
approaches against classical Monte Carlo simulations and Black-Scholes methods.
Beyond simply computing option prices, we emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy and computational resources, offering insights into the potential
advantages and limitations of quantum approaches for different problem scales.
Our results contribute to understanding the feasibility of quantum methods in

Abstract: The sensitivity of non-local optical measurements at low light intensities,
such as those involved in long baseline telescope arrays, can be improved by
using remote entanglement. Here, we demonstrate the use of entangled quantum
memories in a quantum network of Silicon-vacancy centers in diamond
nano-cavities to experimentally perform such non-local phase measurements.
Specifically, we combine the generation of event-ready remote quantum
entanglement, photon mode erasure that hides the "which-path" information of
temporally and spatially separated incoming optical modes, and non-local,
non-destructive photon heralding enabled by remote entanglement to perform a
proof-of-concept entanglement-assisted differential phase measurement of weak
incident light between two spatially separate stations. Demonstrating
successful operation of the remote phase sensing protocol with a fiber link
baseline up to 1.55 km, our results open the door for a new class of quantum
enhanced imaging applications.

Abstract: Extracting information from weak optical signals is a critical challenge
across a broad range of technologies. Conventional imaging techniques,
constrained to integrating over detected signals and classical post-processing,
are limited in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from shot noise accumulation in the
post-processing algorithms. We show that these limitations can be circumvented
by coherently encoding photonic amplitude information into qubit registers and
applying quantum algorithms to process the stored information from
asynchronously arriving optical signals. As a specific example, we develop a
quantum algorithm for imaging unresolved point sources and apply it to
exoplanet detection. We demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvements in
performance can be achieved under realistic imaging conditions using relatively
small scale quantum processors.

Abstract: We investigate Lindbladian fast-forwarding and its applications to estimating
Gibbs state properties. Fast-forwarding refers to the ability to simulate a
system of time $t$ using significantly fewer than $t$ queries or circuit depth.
While various Hamiltonian systems are known to circumvent the no
fast-forwarding theorem, analogous results for dissipative dynamics, governed
by Lindbladians, remain largely unexplored. We first present a quantum
algorithm for simulating purely dissipative Lindbladians with unitary jump
operators, achieving additive query complexity $ \mathcal{O}\left(t +
\frac{\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}{\log\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ up to
error~$\varepsilon$, improving previous algorithms. When the jump operators
have certain structures (i.e., block-diagonal Paulis), the algorithm can be
modified to achieve exponential fast-forwarding, attaining circuit depth
$\mathcal{O}\left(\log\left(t +
\frac{\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}{\log\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)\right)$, while
preserving query complexity. Using these fast-forwarding techniques, we develop
a quantum algorithm for estimating Gibbs state properties of the form $\langle
\psi_1 | e^{-\beta(H + I)} | \psi_2 \rangle$, up to additive error $\epsilon$,
with $H$ the Hamiltonian and $\beta$ the inverse temperature. For input states
exhibiting certain coherence conditions -- e.g.,~$\langle 0|^{\otimes n}
e^{-\beta(H + I)} |+\rangle^{\otimes n}$ -- our method achieves exponential
improvement in complexity (measured by circuit depth), $\mathcal{O} (2^{-n/2}
\epsilon^{-1} \log \beta ),$ compared to the quantum singular value
transformation-based approach, with complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}
(\epsilon^{-1} \sqrt{\beta} )$. For general $| \psi_1 \rangle$ and $| \psi_2
\rangle$, we also show how the level of improvement is changed with the
coherence resource in $| \psi_1 \rangle$ and $| \psi_2 \rangle$.

Abstract: In recent years, the presence of local potentials has significantly enriched
and diversified the entanglement patterns in monitored free fermion systems. In
our approach, we employ the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation to simulate a
one-dimensional spinless fermion system under continuous measurement and local
potentials. By averaging the steady-state entanglement entropy over many
quantum trajectories, we investigate its dependence on measurement and
localization parameters. We used a phenomenological model to interpret the
numerical results, and the results show that the introduction of local
potentials does not destroy the universality class of the entanglement phase
transition, and that the phase boundary is jointly characterized by the
measurement process and the localization mechanism. This work offers a new
perspective on the characterization of the entanglement phase boundary arising
from the combined effects of measurement and localization, and provides
criteria for detecting this novel phase transition in cold atom systems,
trapped ions, and quantum dot arrays.

Abstract: A renewed experimental interest in quantum vacuum fluctuations brings back
the need to extend the study of electromagnetic vacuum correlations. Quantum or
semi-classical models developed to understand various configurations should
combine the effects of the zero-point fluctuations with those of blackbody
radiation. In this paper, after a brief historical introduction and a rapid
study of the electric field correlations in time domain, we propose exact and
approximate expressions for the vacuum field correlations in Fourier space seen
by moving points. We first present an exact computation of the electric field
correlations, expressed in frequency space, between two points moving with
opposite constant velocities on parallel trajectories. We also consider the
electric field self-correlations, i.e. on the same moving point but at
different frequencies, and comment the results related to special relativity.
Then, we compute the exact main symmetrized quadratic electromagnetic field
correlations between two points diametrically opposed on the same circular
trajectory, with diameter r, covered at constant angular velocity {\Omega}. We
derive the expressions for the electromagnetic field correlations with itself
and with its spatial derivatives, still at the locations of the moving points.
Since the points we consider are accelerating, both the zero-point fluctuations
and the blackbody spectrum give non-trivial results, for two-point correlations
as well as for self-correlations. In both cases, results are shown at any
vacuum temperature. For practical uses, we provide the first-order
approximations in the small parameter {\Omega}r/c with c being the speed of
light.

Abstract: The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the
notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable
attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains
largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry
enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct
non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian
free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally
invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes.
Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in
the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent
in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states
at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is
absent in Hermitian systems.

redundant measurements that help correct errors, rather than as a static code
equipped with a syndrome extraction circuit. Spacetime codes have emerged as a
natural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while
leveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on
chain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations
between them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding
problems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence
of two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain
complexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits,
fault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this
framework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer
codes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be
transformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant
properties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the
underlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex
constructions. Our method enables the construction of cluster states from
non-CSS, subsystem, and Floquet codes, as well as from logical Clifford
operations on a given code.

Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices pave the way to implement
quantum algorithms that exhibit supremacy over their classical counterparts.
Due to the intrinsic noise and decoherence in the physical system, NISQ
computations are naturally modeled as large-size but low-depth quantum
circuits. Practically, to execute such quantum circuits, we need to pass
commands to a programmable quantum computer. Existing programming approaches,
dedicated to generic unitary transformations, are inefficient in terms of the
computational resources under the low-depth assumption and remain far from
satisfactory. As such, to realize NISQ algorithms, it is crucial to find an
efficient way to program low-depth circuits as the qubit number $N$ increases.
Here, we investigate the gate complexity and the size of quantum memory (known
as the program cost) required to program low-depth brickwork circuits. We
unveil a $\sim N \text{poly} \log N$ worst-case program cost of universal
programming of low-depth brickwork circuits in the large $N$ regime, which is a
tight characterization. Moreover, we analyze the trade-off between the cost of
describing the layout of local gates and the cost of programming them to the
targeted unitaries via the light-cone argument. Our findings suggest that
faithful gate-wise programming is optimal in the low-depth regime.

Abstract: Quantum Data Centers (QDCs) are needed to support large-scale quantum
processing for both academic and commercial applications. While large-scale
quantum computers are constrained by technological and financial barriers, a
modular approach that clusters small quantum computers offers an alternative.
This approach, however, introduces new challenges in network scalability,
entanglement generation, and quantum memory management. In this paper, we
propose a three-layer fat-tree network architecture for QDCs, designed to
address these challenges. Our architecture features a unique leaf switch and an
advanced swapping spine switch design, optimized to handle high volumes of
entanglement requests as well as a queue scheduling mechanism that efficiently
manages quantum memory to prevent decoherence. Through queuing-theoretical
models and simulations in NetSquid, we demonstrate the proposed architecture's
scalability and effectiveness in maintaining high entanglement fidelity,
offering a practical path forward for modular QDC networks.
