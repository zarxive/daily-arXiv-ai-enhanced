Here, we demonstrate\nemergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model\nwith Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling.

We analyze the dependence of this instability on the nuclear\nwavefunction bifurcation in the stationary and moving frames of reference, the\nlatter associated with the quantum trajectory ensemble describing the nuclear\nXF wavepacket in a compact form. We show that the near-singular behavior\npersists in the moving frame and in the atomic basis representation of the\nelectronic wavefunction.

In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is\ncharacterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven\nabove the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin\nvectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the\ndriven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the\ngap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices\nthat do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the\ngap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite\npolarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension\nexhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence\nin quasi-two-dimension.

The\nracetrack geometry is studied to minimize loss at both the straight-curved\nwaveguide junction and through the waveguide curve. The material absorption,\nintrinsic quality factor, and nonlinear index are extracted by a comprehensive\nmodel fit to laser wavelength resonance scans. The micro-racetrack resonator\npossesses an absorption loss of $0.43 dB/m$, an intrinsic quality factor of\n$4.5 \\times 10^6$, and nonlinear index of $1.28 \\times 10^{-18} m^2/W$, in a\nwaveguide cross-section less than $1 {\\mu}m^2$.

We\nexplore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the\nlogical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert\nspace. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a\nfunction of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates,\nthis spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of\ndifferent weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight\nerrors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well\ndescribed by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an\nexplicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes\nsaturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random\n\\emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical\nerrors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible\nuntil a much higher \\emph{detection} threshold.

This result implies that Haar-random quantum codes are optimal in terms of error correction capabilities, as their error threshold matches that of random stabilizer codes. Furthermore, the study reveals that while typical errors become uncorrectable beyond the hashing threshold, postselected error correction remains possible up to a higher detection threshold. The detection threshold can be achieved by projecting the encoded system onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, effectively enabling error correction in scenarios where traditional methods fail.", "conclusion": "This paper bridges the gap between random matrix theory and quantum error correction by providing a detailed analysis of the phase transition properties of Haar-random quantum codes. The findings not only validate the theoretical predictions about error thresholds but also pave the way for practical applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing, offering a pathway to implement postselected error correction in systems beyond the hashing threshold."}}

Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a model system, we\ndemonstrate shot-noise-limited sensitivity for AC magnetic fields spanning\nnear-DC to MHz frequencies, with detection bandwidth tunable via optical\nexcitation power. The technique captures complete spectral information in a\nsingle measurement, eliminating the need for point-by-point frequency scanning,\nand allows phase-sensitive multi-frequency detection with Hz-level resolution.\nThis approach transforms quantum sensors into atomic-scale spectrum analyzers,\nwith immediate applications for low-frequency RF communication, zero-field NMR,\nand bioelectronic sensing.

In this work, we study the generation\nof such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and\nCu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a\nsolution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale\nquantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus\nnanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the\nspectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under\nsolar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation\nrate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant\nincrease in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size.

While significant progress has been\nmade, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum\ncontrol over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world\nsettings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where\none seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single\nlocal probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing\ntime evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which\nHamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of\ntools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we\nprove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are\nidentifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these\ninsights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe\ntomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\\varepsilon$, with\nquery complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\\varepsilon$ and classical\npost-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\\varepsilon$.

The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal\npath for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder\nthan for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the\nproposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the\nreliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open\ntopic.\n  Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon\nmultiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a\nJosephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by\na dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create\nmultiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis\nprovides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have\npreviously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for\ncounting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by M{\\o}lmer to\ndescribe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with\nstochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and\ndetection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection\nprobabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high\npopulation of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily\ndistinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with\na conventional linear amplifier.

Our results extend the research frontier of beam\nsplitters and may have potential applications in integrated photonic devices\nand modern communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bbd\u9891\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u8c03\u9891\u7684\u53cc\u7aef\u9762\u5929\u7ebfSplitter\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSplitter\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u3001\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u8026\u5408\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u5e72\u6d89\u5728\u5fae\u6ce2\u548c\u5149\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53cc\u7aef\u9762\u5929\u7ebfSplitter\u5b58\u5728\u6563\u5c04\u3001\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u5355\u5411\u8868\u9762\u78c1\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\uff08USMP\uff09\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u53cc\u7aef\u9762\u5929\u7ebfSplitter\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684Splitter\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u5bbd\u9891\u6bb5\uff08\u51e0\u4e4e\u6574\u4e2aUSMP\u9891\u6bb5\uff09\u3001\u4efb\u610f\u53ef\u8c03\u4e14\u9891\u7387\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5206\u9694\u6bd4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u8c03\u8282\u5de5\u4f5c\u9891\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53cc\u7aef\u9762Splitter\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5149\u96c6\u6210\u5668\u4ef6\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While it is well established that the full theory\nconsistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its\nlinearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that\nthis is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of\nall traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the\nSchwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon\nis a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten\nsecond-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three\nmomentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint.

This paper explores further the scale function source term to\nconstruct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of\nboth Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It\nis shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry\ncomprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of\nlength units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally\nfixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in\nwhich the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity\nis obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same\nprocedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke\ngravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from\ntheir Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the\nMach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is\ncontrolled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known\nscalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular\nLyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls\nthe unit of length.

On such hardware, it is useful to\nensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in\nthe noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for\nbiased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms.\nIn this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj\nQuantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving\ngates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel\ncharacterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a\nlinear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving\ngate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set\n{X,R_z(\\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \\theta is any irrational multiple of 2\\pi.\n(3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any\nZ-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving\ngates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that\nZ-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses how quantum computing platforms with certain native qubits are more susceptible to specific types of noise, specifically Pauli-Z or Pauli-X noise, depending on the platform. The authors focus on developing fault-tolerant quantum computing methods that preserve the bias of the noise, which is essential for efficient error correction in biased-noise models. They provide a characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates, show how to approximate such gates using a specific set of quantum gates, and establish the realization of logical operators in CSS codes using these gates. However, the proof only covers Z-bias-preserving logical operators and does not generalize to all quantum operations, and the exact universality capabilities of Z-bias-preserving gates remain unclear.", "motivation": "Quantum error correction is crucial for building reliable quantum computers. For platforms with biased noise, which is common in current quantum hardware, standard error correction codes and fault-tolerant operations are not optimal.

To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a\nframework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full\nsystem's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50\nyears, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by\nderiving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational\naxioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem\nrelate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong\nconnection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III,\nand their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of\noperational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of\ntype III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error\nwhen \"embezzling\" entanglement from the system.

Our results hold for a general family of codes\nwherein the code and the dual code are \"simultaneously nice\"; in particular,\nfor codes admitting good syndrome decodability and whose duals look \"similar\".\nThese include expander codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u56fe\u4ea7\u54c1\u7801\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u89e3\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8d85\u56fe\u4ea7\u54c1\u7801\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u6709\u7684 syndrome decoding \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d85\u56fe\u4ea7\u54c1\u7801\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684 syndrome decoding\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e94\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u3002"}}

While quantum process tomography can fully characterize a\nPOVM, it is resource-intensive and impractical when only specific POVM elements\nor matrix elements of a particular POVM element are of interest. Direct quantum\nmeasurement tomography offers a more efficient alternative but typically relies\non weak interactions and complex structures of the system, environment, and\nprobe as the dimension of the system increases, limiting its precision and\nscalability. Furthermore, characterizing a POVM element alone is insufficient\nto determine the underlying physical mechanism, as multiple Kraus operators can\nyield the same measurement statistics. In this work, we present a unified\nframework for the direct characterization of individual matrix elements of\nKraus operators associated with specific POVM elements and arbitrary input\nstates without requiring weak interaction, complex structures of the\nsystem-environment-probe or full process and state tomography.

A central\nchallenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate\nHaar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford\noperations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able\nto generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial\nquantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford\ngates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design\nonly to a subsystem of size $\\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This \"seed\" design\nis then \"diluted\" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between\ntwo random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this\nconstruction achieves full quantum security against adaptive adversaries using\nonly $\\tilde{O}(k^2 \\log\\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requires\nsecurity only against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford\ncost decreases to $\\tilde{O}(k + \\log^{1+c} \\varepsilon^{-1})$.

In this work, we\nanalyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a\nGreen's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative.\nExplicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to\nan extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum\ncontrol. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static\nHamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features\ndirectly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically\nvarying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection\nand memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the\nevolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity.

Here, we develop a\nframework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource\ntheories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an\nagent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as\na game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal\nbetting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function.\nExtending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward\ntrade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of\nextractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk\nsensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a\nrational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by\na R\\'enyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and\ngambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an\nadversarial setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

On the other hand, if the\nobfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit $Q$ into a quantum state\n$|\\hat{Q}\\rangle$, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating all\npseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and\nYamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and\nall unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025).\n  We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical\nobfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. We do this by giving\nthe first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE)\nscheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum\nevaluation, relative to a classical oracle.\n  To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on the approach of Bartusek,\nKitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which required ciphertexts that\nare both quantum and non-compact due to the use of quantum coset states and\ntheir publicly-verifiable properties. We introduce new techniques for analyzing\ncoset states that can be generated ''on the fly'', by proving new cryptographic\nproperties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO\n2025). Our techniques allow us to produce QFHE ciphertexts that are purely\nclassical, compact, and publicly-verifiable.

The\nfastest attacks (both classical and quantum) are for $k=2$, but taking larger\n$k$ reduces the amount of memory required for the attack. In this paper we\nimprove the quantum time complexity of 3-tuple sieving from $2^{0.3098 d}$ to\n$2^{0.2846 d}$, using a two-level amplitude amplification aided by a\npreprocessing step that associates the given lattice vectors with nearby\n''center points'' to focus the search on the neighborhoods of these center\npoints. Our algorithm uses $2^{0.1887d}$ classical bits and QCRAM bits, and\n$2^{o(d)}$ qubits.

Recent works have shown that the training of IQP-QCBM is\nclassically tractable w.r.t. the so-called Gaussian kernel maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) loss function, while maintaining the potential of a quantum\nadvantage for sampling itself. Nonetheless, the model has a number of aspects\nwhere improvements would be important for more general utility: (1) the basic\nmodel is known to be not universal - i.e. it is not capable of representing\narbitrary distributions, and it was not known whether it is possible to achieve\nuniversality by adding hidden (ancillary) qubits; (2) a fixed Gaussian kernel\nused in the MMD loss can cause training issues, e.g., vanishing gradients. In\nthis paper, we resolve the first question and make decisive strides on the\nsecond. We prove that for an $n$-qubit IQP generator, adding $n + 1$ hidden\nqubits makes the model universal. For the latter, we propose a kernel-adaptive\ntraining method, where the kernel is adversarially trained. We show that in the\nkernel-adaptive method, the convergence of the MMD value implies weak\nconvergence in distribution of the generator. We also analytically analyze the\nlimitations of the MMD-based training method. Finally, we verify the\nperformance benefits on the dataset crafted to spotlight improvements by the\nsuggested method. The results show that kernel-adaptive training outperforms a\nfixed Gaussian kernel in total variation distance, and the gap increases with\nthe dataset dimensionality.

For example, it\ncan obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random\n$k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for\naverage-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum\nalgorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian\nensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the\nstandard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking\nobstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a\nLipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof\nrelies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase\ntransition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to\ndecompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance.\nThis yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian\nevolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds,\nour results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed\nstate. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic\nHamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that\nthe ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian\ncoefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the\ngeneral $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant\n$p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic\n(SYK, never glassy) counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u73bb\u7483\u76f8\u963b\u585e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c lip_schitz \u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u7279\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u963b\u585e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u9650\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

Yet rigorous methods for time-dependent Hamiltonians\nand Lindbladians remain scarce despite their wide use. We close this gap by\nlearning the time-dependent evolution of a locally interacting $n$-qubit system\non a graph of effective dimension $D$ using only preparation of product Pauli\neigenstates, evolution under the time-dependent generator for given times, and\nmeasurements in product Pauli bases. We assume the time-dependent parameters\nare well approximated by functions in a known space of dimension $m$ admitting\nstable interpolation, e.g. by polynomials. Our protocol outputs functions\napproximating these coefficients to accuracy $\\epsilon$ on an interval with\nsuccess probability $1-\\delta$, requiring only\n$O\\big(\\epsilon^{-2}poly(m)\\log(n\\delta^{-1})\\big)$ samples and $poly(n,m)$\npre/postprocessing. Importantly, the scaling in $m$ is polynomial, whereas\nnaive extensions of previous methods scale exponentially. The method estimates\ntime derivatives of observable expectations via interpolation, yielding\nwell-conditioned linear systems for the generator's coefficients. The main\ndifficulty in the time-dependent setting is to evaluate these coefficients at\nfinite times while preserving a controlled link between derivatives and\ndynamical parameters. Our innovation is to combine Lieb-Robinson bounds,\nprocess shadows, and semidefinite programs to recover the coefficients\nefficiently at constant times. Along the way, we extend state-of-the-art\nLieb-Robinson bounds on general graphs to time-dependent, dissipative dynamics,\na contribution of independent interest.

We use the maximal average n-tangle that can be generated\non a fixed subsystem by measuring its complement -- either with local or global\nmeasurements -- as our key figure of merit. These quantities are known\nrespectively as the localizable entanglement (LE) and the entanglement of\nassistance (EA). We build upon the work of [arXiv:2411.04080] that proposed a\npolynomial-time test, based on the EA, for whether it is possible to transform\ncertain graph states into others using local measurements. We show, using\nproperties of the EA, that this test is effective and useful in large systems\nfor a wide range of sizes of the measured subsystem. In particular, we use this\ntest to demonstrate the surprising result that general local unitaries and\nglobal measurements will typically not provide an advantage over the more\nexperimentally feasible local Clifford unitaries and local Pauli measurements\nin transforming large linear cluster states into GHZ states. Finally, we derive\nconcentration inequalities for the LE and EA over Haar-random states which\nindicate that the localized entanglement structure has a striking dependence on\nthe locality of the measurement. In deriving these concentration inequalities,\nwe develop several technical tools that may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5269\u4f59\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5229\u7528EA\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8Clifford\u548c\u5c40\u90e8Pauli\u6d4b\u91cf\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u5c06\u5927\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u6001\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aGHZ\u6001\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7ea0\u7f20\u548cEA\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5229\u7528\u7ea0\u7f20\u8d44\u6e90\u662f Current \u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7EA\u548cLE\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7ea0\u7f20\u548cEA\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "Zero\u5728\u6784\u5efaEA\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e86EA\u7684\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u3002 article\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eEA\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6001\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5173\u4e8eLE\u548cEA\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ea0\u7f20\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u5411GHZ\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u4f53\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7ea0\u7f20\u548cEA\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5bf9\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684EA\u548cLE\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aQuantum\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

We show three sets of\nresults: (1. Energy growth rates) There exist bosonic gate sets which increase\nenergy incredibly rapidly, obtaining e.g. infinite energy in finite/constant\ntime. We prove these high energies can make computing properties of bosonic\ncomputations, such as deciding whether a given computation will attain infinite\nenergy, extremely difficult, formally undecidable. (2. Lower bounds on\ncomputational power) More energy ``='' more computational power. For example,\ncertain gate sets allow poly-time bosonic computations to simulate PTOWER, the\nset of deterministic computations whose runtime scales as a tower of\nexponentials with polynomial height. Even just exponential energy and $O(1)$\nmodes suffice to simulate NP, which, importantly, is a setup similar to that of\nthe recent bosonic factoring algorithm of [Brenner, Caha, Coiteux-Roy and\nKoenig (2024)]. For simpler gate sets, we show an energy hierarchy theorem. (3.\nUpper bounds on computational power) Bosonic computations with polynomial\nenergy can be simulated in BQP, ``physical'' bosonic computations with\narbitrary finite energy are decidable, and the gate set consisting of Gaussian\ngates and the cubic phase gate can be simulated in PP, with exponential bound\non energy, improving upon the previous PSPACE upper bound.
