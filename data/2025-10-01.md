### [1] [Improved capabilities of the TurboGAP code for radiation induced cascade simulations: an illustration with silicon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26199)
*Uttiyoarnab Saha,Ali Hamedani,Miguel A. Caro,Andrea E. Sand*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: TurboGAP software efficiently simulates molecular dynamics using Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) machine learning potentials. This work enhances TurboGAP for radiation damage simulations by introducing a two-temperature model, adaptive timestep control, and atom grouping. The software incorporates accurate models for electronic stopping power, enabling simulations of radiation-induced defects and ion-beam mixing in large systems with up to 1 million atoms. Comparisons with experimental data highlight improvements in predicting mixing values when using GAP-MLIP with realistic electronic stopping models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations for radiation damage studies. By integrating advanced GAP MLIP models and adaptive simulation techniques, the researchers aim to better understand and predict radiation-induced defects and ion-beam mixing in materials, which is crucial for applications in nuclear engineering and materials science.

Method: The methodology involves enhancing TurboGAP by implementing a two-temperature molecular dynamics model to couple electronic and atomic subsystems. Adaptive timestep control and atom grouping are used to optimize computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The electronic stopping power is modeled using two approaches: a traditional friction-based model and a more realistic first-principles-derived model. The simulations are performed on silicon systems with primary knock-on atom energies up to 10 keV, and the results are validated against experimental data.

Result: The key results include the successful implementation of the enhanced TurboGAP framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy for radiation damage simulations. The simulations successfully generate and cluster radiation-induced defects, and the ion-beam mixing calculations show enhanced agreement with experimental data when using GAP-MLIP with a realistic electronic stopping model. This validation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and highlights the potential for applying TurboGAP to study large-scale radiation damage phenomena in complex systems.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the integration of GAP MLIP with adaptive timestep control and realistic electronic stopping models in TurboGAP has advanced the field of molecular dynamics simulations for radiation damage. The framework's ability to handle large atomistic systems while maintaining high accuracy provides a powerful tool for understanding and predicting radiation-induced damage in materials. Future work will focus on extending these capabilities to study continuum limits and more complex damage processes in various materials systems.

Abstract: TurboGAP is a software package designed for efficient molecular dynamics
simulations using Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) machine-learning
interatomic potentials (MLIP). In this work, we enhance the capabilities of
TurboGAP for radiation damage simulations by implementing a two-temperature
molecular dynamics model, based on electron density-dependent coupling of
electronic and atomic subsystems. Additionally, we implement adaptive
calculation of the timestep and grouping of atoms for cell-border cooling. Our
implementation incorporates electronic stopping power either through a
traditional friction-based model or a more realistic first-principles-derived
model. By combining the computational efficiency of TurboGAP with the accuracy
of GAP MLIP, we perform cascade simulations in silicon with primary knock-on
atom (PKA) energies up to 10 keV. Our simulations scale to systems containing
up to 1 million atoms. We study the generation and clustering of
radiation-induced defects. We also calculate ion-beam mixing and compare our
results with the experimental data, discussing how the GAP-MLIP along with the
inclusion of a realistic electronic stopping model improves the prediction of
experimental mixing values.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A custom apparatus designed to isolate and replicate the spreading process of
metal powder in additive manufacturing demonstrates a sudden and unexplained
increase in packing density beyond layers 5 to 10. We replicate the experiments
that lead to densification with the discrete element method (DEM) using
\lethe{}, an open-source software framework. We show that large-scale
multi-layer DEM simulations are able to reproduce the densification observed
experimentally. Using the Lagrangian simulation results, we highlight
significant particle displacement in the powder bed at lower layer number,
accompanied by static zones generated by the vertical wall surrounding the
powder bed. The amplitude of the densification and the layer number at which it
starts to occur is correlated to the distance between those two vertical walls
which delimit the powder spreading area. This study addresses the gap between
mono-layer powder spreading studies on hard-flat surfaces and the actual metal
powder-based additive manufacturing processes by providing a better
understanding of how the powder bed behaves during multi-layer spreading.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究希望揭示AdS长度修正对热力学量的影响，进而理解重力理论和热力学eny的学生需要理解研究的核心目的是理解AdS修正对热力学的影响。

Method: 使用了AdS修正模型和数值模拟，分析了各种热力学量随黑体大小的变化。

Result: AdS长度修正影响了几个热力学量，正修正增强这些量随黑体大小的变化速度，负修正导致相反效应。

Conclusion: AdS修正对黑洞热力学敏感，需考虑这些修正以分析引力理论和黑洞行为。

Abstract: The research paper investigates the thermodynamic behavior of a black hole in
a cloud of strings (CoS) and perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), incorporating a
minor correction to the Anti de Sitter (AdS) length scale. The study reveals
that while the entropy remains unaffected by the AdS length correction, other
thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, free energy, pressure, internal
energy, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity exhibit significant modifications.
Positive corrections to the AdS length generally enhance these quantities,
leading to faster growth or slower decay with increasing black hole size, while
negative corrections often produce the opposite effect, sometimes resulting in
divergent or negative values. These findings highlight the sensitivity of black
hole thermodynamics to geometric corrections and exotic matter fields,
providing deeper information about the interplay between such modifications and
thermodynamic stability. These results underscore the importance of considering
minor corrections in theoretical models to better understand black hole
behavior in the presence of dark matter and string-like matter distributions.

### [4] [The Hubble tension as an effect of the renormalization of fundamental constants and cosmological parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25287)
*Fabio Briscese*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper proposes that the Hubble tension results from scale-dependent variations of the Newton constant and the cosmological constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring why the Hubble constant measured by different methods differs and potential implications for cosmology.

Method: Theoretical analysis of scale-running of G and Lambda, comparing observations from CMB and Supernovae.

Result: Suggests that considering scale dependence of fundamental constants explains the Hubble tension.

Conclusion: The observed Hubble tension may stem from varying G and Lambda at different cosmological scales.

Abstract: In this Letter we propose an interpretation of the Hubble tension as an
effect of the scale-running of cosmological parameters and fundamental
constants, as the Newton's constant $G$ and the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. Namely, the tension between $H_0$ measurements by CMB and Supernovae
observations would be a consequence of the fact that the value of $H_0$ depends
(due to the running of $G$ and $\Lambda$) on the scale at which it is measured.
Indeed, the two different values of the Hubble parameter today correspond to
the two different cosmological scales at which Supernovae and CMB measurements
probe our universe. We discuss some possible theoretical scenarios in which the
running of $G$ and $\Lambda$ can occur. We stress that one should interpret
such a running as a scale-dependence of the cosmological parameters and
fundamental constants at the same time rather than a time dependence, as it is
usually considered in the literature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate how inflation can emerge from four-fermion interactions
generated by spacetime torsion, eliminating the need for additional scalar
fields beyond the Standard Model. We partition fermions in two sectors and
introduce two bound fields. In the effective theory approach, once all the
fermions have been integrated out, the bound fields serve as the inflaton and
the auxiliary field, in analogy to the hybrid inflation and accounting for a
waterfall (hybrid) mechanism. The inclusion of an axial chemical potential
naturally facilitates the end of reheating. During the waterfall regime, the
effective potential governing the fermion condensate supports the formation of
non-topological solitons, known as Q-balls, which can be accounted for seeding
primordial black holes (PBHs).

### [6] [On Stability and Isotropization of Kasner Solution in $R^{2}$ Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25470)
*Dmitri Pogosyan,Akash Kav*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the stability of Kasner-like expansion in the presence of a quadratic quantum-gravitational term in the Lagrangian for the universe's early expansion. Kasner solutions, which describe anisotropic expansion, are found to be unstable. The paper shows that some initial conditions lead to collapsing universes, while others result in an isotropized universe undergoing a slow-roll inflationary stage similar to Starobinsky inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from cosmology, seeking to understand the role of quantum gravity effects on the early universe's expansion and its isotropization.

Method: The authors use a combination of analytical methods and bifurcation analysis. They analyze the stability of Kasner solutions within the Kantowski-Sachs spacetime framework under the influence of an $R^2$ term in the quantum gravitational action.

Result: The key result is the identification of a bifurcation line that distinguishes initial conditions leading to collapse versus continued expansion. Under suitable conditions, isotropization occurs, leading to a slow-roll inflationary phase.

Conclusion: This study contributes to the understanding of how quantum gravity effects modify early universe dynamics, supporting inflationary scenarios through the mechanism of anisotropy stabilization and slow-roll inflation.

Abstract: The fate of the Universe that initially expands anisotropically in the theory
with $R^{2}$ quantum-gravitational term in the Lagrangian is investigated. The
stability of Kasner-like expansion, specifically in the class of
Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes, is analyzed. Kasner solutions are found to be
unstable, with the bifurcation line between the initial conditions that lead to
collapsing universes and the ones that set the universe for continuing
expansion that becomes isotropic, established analytically. Under suitable
conditions, the isotropized spacetime enters the intermediate slow-rolling
inflationary stage similar to Starobinsky inflation.

Result: 揭示了暗物质 halo对引力波记忆效应的具体影响，为提取暗物质 halo参数提供了新方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为结合引力波观测和暗物质 halo研究揭示其参数提供了可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational wave (GW) memory effect for a black
hole embedded in a dark matter halo described by a Hernquist-type density
profile, both with and without a spike. We first solve the geodesic equations
in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined
effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation
equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect
manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that,
we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the
Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux
balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to
quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the
ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for
extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.

complementarity between different GW detectors and with other astroparticle
experiments. Finally, we outline future prospects with next-generation
detectors, like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and space-based
missions.

Conclusion: 该研究成果为观察裸奇点提供了方法，提高了对洛巴奇夫斯基-马拉法尼诺娃-拉亚诺型裸奇点的理解，同时为研究宇宙中的重元素分布和演化提供了新视角。

Abstract: We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole
(BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked
singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the
tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither
can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption.
Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's
material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant
observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the
disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption
event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have
implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such
an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and
studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the
NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction,
we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a
specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results
with observations.

Result: 发现TT规范在宇宙学中适用，多种规范在满足真空条件时等效，解释了已有文献结果。

Conclusion: TT规范为研究更高阶引力波提供了有用的框架，有助于规范问题的分析。

Abstract: The gauge problem arises in the second order gravitational waves due to the
mode mixing. Here, we introduce the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge to
cosmological backgrounds, and find that if we choose the TT gauge at first
order, the second order tensor mode would be gauge invariant. Analogous to the
Ricci flat spacetime, the vacuum condition is the key to guarantee the
existence of the TT gauge on cosmological backgrounds. When we have the vacuum
condition, the Poisson gauge, the uniform curvature gauge, the synchronous
gauge and the total matter gauge are all equivalent to the TT gauge. Once the
vacuum condition is approximately satisfied, the Poisson gauge would reduce to
the TT gauge at the same order of approximation. With the sub-horizon limit,
the vacuum condition could be obtained approximately, and the Poisson gauge,
the uniform curvature gauge and the synchronous gauge are all approximated TT
gauge. Our findings explain several existing results in the literature and
indicate that the proposed TT gauge is useful to discuss higher order
gravitational waves.

Conclusion: 本研究为未来的空间光测任务提供了理论基础和数据处理方法。

Abstract: Todays astrometry has reached the micro-arcsecond level in angular
measurements of celestial objects. The next generations of astrometric
facilities are aiming at the sub-micro-arcsecond scale. Sub-micro-arcsecond
astrometry requires a considerable improvement in the theory of light
propagation in the curved space-time of the solar system. In particular, it is
indispensable to determine light trajectories to the second order of the
post-Newtonian scheme, where the monopole and quadrupole structure of some
solar system bodies need to be taken into account. In reality, both the light
source as well as the observer are located at finite spatial distances from the
gravitating body. This fact implies for the need to solve the boundary value
problem of light propagation, where the light trajectory is fully determined by
the spatial positions of source and observer and its unit direction at past
infinity. This problem has been solved in a recent investigation. A practical
relativistic model of observational data reduction necessitates the
determination of the unit tangent vector along the light trajectory at the
spatial position of the observer, which is determined by a sequence of several
basic transformations. The determination of this unit tangent vector allows one
to calculate the impact of the monopole and quadrupole structure of solar
system bodies on light deflection on the sub-micro-arcsecond level, both for
stellar light sources as well as for light sources located in the solar system.
Numerical values for the magnitude of light deflection caused by the monopole
and quadrupole structure of the body are given for grazing light rays at the
giant planets. The model GREM is presently used for data reduction of the ESA
astrometry mission Gaia. It is shown how the implementation of these basic
transformations into GREM would proceed for possible future space astrometry
missions.

Abstract: It has been previously shown that multidimensional $f(R)$ gravity

  In this paper, we analyze such a model with a spatially flat 4D de

  It is stated that the physical parameters such as the 4D Planck mass,

  with the evolving universal energy scale, even on the classical level.
  We also show that the Higgs vacuum expectation value is different on
  different branes.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the frame-dragging effect on an accretion disk
and test gyroscope orbiting around a rotating regular black hole with a
Minkowski core. Firstly, we perturb a bound timelike circular orbit around the
black hole, and analyze the periastron precession and Lense-Thirring (LT)
precession frequencies of the orbit's epicyclic oscillations. Since these
epicyclic oscillations can be used to explain the quasiperiodic oscillations
(QPOs) phenomena of the accretion disc around this rotating regular black hole,
we then employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to fit our
theoretical results with five QPOs events (GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE
J1859+226, H1743-322 and XTE J1550-564). The simulations give the relevant
physical parameter space of the black hole, including the characteristic radius
$r$, the mass related parameter $M$, the spinning parameter $a$ and the quantum
gravity effect $\alpha$. The results give the constraint on the quantum effect
parameter, with an upper limit $\alpha/M^{3/2} < 0.60$ at the $95\%$ C.L.,
which is tighter than $<0.7014$ in our pervious study within static case. Then,
we theoretically explore the LT precession frequency, geodetic precession
frequency, and the general spin precession frequency of a test gyro attached to
a stationary observer in this black hole background. We find that the quantum
gravity effect suppresses the precession frequencies comparing against those in
Kerr black hole, further providing a theoretical diagnostic of the potential
quantum gravity effect.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate regular rotating black holes predicted by asymptotically safe
gravity, where the Newton constant varies with energy scale and modifies the
near horizon geometry. These solutions remain asymptotically flat and avoid
central singularities while differing from the classical Kerr spacetime in the
strong field region. We compute the radiative efficiency of thin accretion
disks and the jet power from the Blandford Znajek mechanism, both of which
depend on the deformation parameter of the model. The predictions are compared
with observational estimates for six stellar mass black holes. For systems with
low or moderate spin the model reproduces the data within reported
uncertainties, while rapidly spinning sources such as GRS 1915 105 present
tensions and point to a restricted deformation range or the need for additional
physics. The results show that quantum corrections confined to the strong
gravity regime can still leave detectable imprints on high energy astrophysical
processes. Radiative and jet based diagnostics therefore provide a promising
method to test the geometry near the horizon and to explore possible signatures
of quantum gravity in observations.

### [18] [Affine Gauge Theory: A Diffeomorphism Invariant Gauge Theory of Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26410)
*Kurniawan Tjandra,Kuldip Singh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper comprehensively examines Affine Gauge Theory (AGT) as a potential gauge theory of gravity, highlighting its mathematical framework involving principal fiber bundles and affine connections. It establishes the relationship between AGT and teleparallel theories, demonstrating AGT's diffeomorphism invariance and its preference for being background independent, making General Relativity a special case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gravitational theories through the lens of gauge theory could offer new insights into quantum gravity and spacetime structure, especially if AGT's background independence aligns with quantum mechanical principles.

Method: The paper employs a mathematical rigor approach, utilizing principal fiber bundles, affine connections, and diffeomorphism invariance to analyze AGT's structure.

Result: AGT is shown to be diffeomorphism invariant, mathematically consistent, and a viable candidate for a background-independent theory of gravity, similar to General Relativity.

Conclusion: AGT represents a robust framework for unifying gravity with gauge theories, offering a promising alternative to General Relativity with potential implications for quantum gravity research.

Abstract: This paper is a comprehensive investigation of the Affine Gauge Theory (AGT)
as a gauge theory of gravity having the same mathematical structure as gauge
theories of the other fundamental forces of nature. This mathematical structure
consists of a principal fiber bundle over the spacetime manifold that is
endowed with an affine connection. The relationship between AGT and various
formulations of teleparallel theories of gravity, which are alternatives to
General Relativity, are examined. Here, it is argued that the Affine Bundle is
the most natural principal fibre bundle for a gauge theory of gravity. AGT is
also shown to be strictly diffeomorphism invariant. In particular, an explicit
proof of diffeomorphism invariance in AGT is given - showing that AGT possesses
the important symmetry of General Relativity, as would be expected from a
theory of gravity. Lastly, the claim that AGT is background independent, as
General Relativity is, from varying degrees of strictness in the definition of
background independence is closely examined. Reasons for why a background
independent theory is preferred are also discussed.

Abstract: This paper answers examines the relationship between Diffeomorphism
Invariance and Background Independence. First, a review of the relationship
between Background Independence, General Relativity (GR) and pre-GR theories
are given. Then, a wide range of other conceptions of background independence
is discussed. It is shown that the definition of Background Independence is
fluid and can mean different things to different philosophers and/or
physicists. Most pertinently, the paper addresses the question of what kind of
background independence is implied by a mathematical criterion of
diffeomorphism invariance or in what sense is diffeomorphism invariance
background independence. Lastly, the concept of haecceity in relation to
diffeomorphism invariance is discussed.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 数值相对论模拟为研究宇宙学时空中强密度区域的演化和终态提供了方法，具体应用于primordial black hole形成和inflation的稳健性研究。采用一种先前在渐近平坦时空中使用的方法，证明了对于给定的过密度过和平均曲率，哈密顿约束方程的解不一定存在，且如果存在解，可能不唯一。存在两支解，分别对应强场和弱场解，连接处过密度过大，解不存在。这意味着过密度过在平衡内在而非外在曲率时有一个限制。即使在过密度过低于此限制时，迭代方法构造初始数据可能收敛到任一支的解，导致 evolved 时物理结果不一致。

Motivation: 该论文探讨了数值相对论模拟在宇宙学中的应用，挑战了关于解的存在性与多重性的假设，对primordial black hole形成和inflation理论有一定的启示。

Method: 使用数值相对论模拟的方法，通过构建具有不同初始条件的解，比较解的存在性和多重性。

Result: 数值模拟证明了解的存在性与多重性取决于过密度过和平均曲率，解不在所有情况下都存在。

Conclusion: 数值相对论模拟揭示了在宇宙学中过密度过对解存在性的限制，这对于理解primordial black hole形成和inflation的作用至关重要。

Abstract: Numerical relativity simulations provide a means by which to study the
evolution and end point of strong over-densities in cosmological spacetimes.
Specific applications include studies of primordial black hole formation and
the robustness of inflation. Here we adopt a toy model previously used in
asymptotically flat spacetimes to show that, for given values of the
over-density and the mean curvature, solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint
need not exist, and if they do exist they are not unique. Specifically, pairs
of solutions exist on two branches, corresponding to strong-field and
weak-field solutions, that join at a maximum beyond which solutions cease to
exist. As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can
be balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice.
Even below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge
to solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting
guess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution.

Abstract: Cold atomic clouds are promising platforms for generating correlated photons,
but multiple scattering and associated Doppler broadening limit their temporal
coherence. Here we demonstrate that cloud geometry provides a powerful means to
extend the coherence time of scattered light. In the experiment,
intensity-correlation measurements show that an elongated (quasi-1D) cloud
exhibits systematically longer coherence times than a spherical (3D) cloud of
the same on-axis optical thickness, as a direct consequence of the suppression
of multiple scattering in the elongated geometry. Random-walk simulations
reproduce this trend and further show that elongation drives the coherence time
toward the single-scattering limit. The combined results establish cloud
geometry as a robust control parameter for temporal coherence in cold-atom
ensembles, with potential applications in quantum optics and communication.

Abstract: We develop machine learning techniques for estimating physical properties of
laser-cooled potassium-39 atoms in a magneto-optical trap using only the
scattered light -- i.e., fluorescence -- that is intrinsic to the cooling
process. In-situ snap-shot images of fluorescing atomic ensembles directly
reveal the spatial structure of these millimeter-scale objects but contain no
obvious information regarding internal properties such as the temperature. We
first assembled and labeled a balanced dataset sampling $8\times10^3$ different
experimental parameters that includes examples with: large and dense atomic
ensembles, a complete absence of atoms, and everything in between. We describe
a range of models trained to predict atom number and temperature solely from
fluorescence images. These run the gamut from a poorly performing linear
regression model based only on integrated fluorescence to deep neural networks
that give number and temperature with fractional uncertainties of $0.1$ and
$0.2$ respectively.

Abstract: The production of high-yield, longitudinally polarized positron beams
represents an outstanding challenge in advanced accelerator science.
Laser-driven schemes offer a compact alternative but typically yield only
transverse polarization, or require pre-polarized electron beams, and struggle
to efficiently accelerate positrons to high energies. Here, we introduce an
all-optical scheme that overcomes these limitations by integrating positron
generation, acceleration, and spin manipulation in a unified framework. Through
a head-on collision between an ultraintense, circularly polarized laser pulse
and a counterpropagating unpolarized electron beam, we drive a robust QED
cascade. The nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process within the cascade produces
positrons that are born directly within the strong laser field. Crucially,
these positrons are instantaneously captured and accelerated to multi-GeV
energies (up to $\sim$9 GeV) via a direct laser acceleration mechanism, while
their spins are simultaneously rotated to longitudinal alignment by the field
dynamics. Our Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the simultaneous achievement of a
high positron yield ($\sim$20 $e^+/e^-$), a high average longitudinal
polarization ($\sim$50\%), and GeV-scale energies. This all-optical source,
feasible at upcoming ultraintense laser facilities, presents a compact and
efficient solution for applications in collider physics and fundamental
high-energy experiments.

Motivation: 该研究基于AdS/CFT对偶，揭示了尺度分离在特定AdS紧致化中的起到了关键作用，这在AdS/CFT的研究背景中具有重要意义。 

Method: 运用了AdS空间中的场论以及标量势分析，研究了渐近区域的标量势行为，特别是V随尺度的变化率。研究把标量场轨迹与渐近区域的条件联系起来。

Result: 发现当α>2时，标量势在渐近区域无法满足尺度分离的条件，这种情况下CFT无法存在。

Conclusion: 推断满足尺度分离的AdS紧致化Mostly在String的框架下不成立，特别是在需要尺度分离以获得稳定的De Sitter宇宙提升的KKLT等模型。

Abstract: In this work, we point out a contradiction between holography and
scale-separated AdS (i.e. parametrically large mass gap) in string theory,
making the standard assumption that the holographic CFT describes the IR
degrees of freedom on a brane that decouple from gravity. We show that the CFT
can only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS
satisfies a certain criterion. Namely, there must exist a scalar field
trajectory that follows the gradient of the scalar potential to the asymptotic
region of the scalar field space in which limit $V\sim m^\alpha$, where
$\alpha\leq 2$ is a constant and $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower of
states. This condition, which implies lack of scale-separation, is satisfied in
the standard examples of AdS/CFT. However, proposed attempts at achieving scale
separation, such as DGKT, employ scalar potentials that scale as $m^\alpha$
with $\alpha>2$ in the asymptotic region of moduli space. We therefore conclude
that the CFT duals of DGKT vacua cannot exist in string theory. Barring
fine-tuning, our conclusions apply to other Ricci-flat flux compactifications
including the KKLT scenario which relies on scale separation to obtain a
metastable de Sitter uplift.

Abstract: We uncover a universal sector of relativistic fluid dynamics by taking a
novel ultrarelativistic limit in which the temperature tends to zero while the
flow simultaneously approaches the speed of light. In this regime,
hydrodynamics becomes an effective theory of \emph{null matter}, characterised
by a preferred null vector, a preferred scale, and their gradients. We show
that this theory of null matter constitutes an example of a hydrodynamic theory
that can be linearly stable and causal in an arbitrary choice of frame. The
framework developed here for null matter can offer insights into
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, astrophysical phenomena with inherently
large Lorentz factors, and the dynamics of black hole horizons.

Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization,
resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially
ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would
rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand
these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive
example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in
abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel
non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means
of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin,
with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more
ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis
H").

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider holographic entanglement entropy in AdS black hole backgrounds by
using the limit of large number of dimensions. By dividing the geometry to two
patches (with one patch covering the vicinity of the black hole horizon and
another covering the other regions), we are able to obtain fully analytic
expressions for the entropy when the entanglement region is a strip. We argue
that apart from conformal field theories at finite temperature in high number
of dimensions, our method works for nearly critical theories in 3+1 dimensions.
In the case of extremal black holes, dual to quantum critical systems, the
results take a particularly simple form. We also comment on the case of soliton
geometries. Finally, we analyze entanglement entropy for wide strips, and
propose a general formula for the first subleading term in the expansion of the
entropy in (inverse) system size for generic entanglement regions.

Abstract: We apply the S-matrix formalism developed in Part I to the interacting scalar
theory in four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. The amplitudes are computed in
the angular momentum basis, appropriate to the representations of $SO(1,4)$ de
Sitter symmetry group. We discuss the properties of wavefunctions in
Bunch-Davies vacuum and derive a new integral representation for the Feynman
propagator. We focus on deep infrared processes probing the large scale
structure of spacetime, in particular on the processes that are normally
forbidden by the energy-momentum conservation laws in flat spacetime. We find
that there are no stable particles in self-interacting scalar field theory, but
the decay rates are exponentially suppressed for particles with masses far
above $\hbar/c\ell$, where $\ell$ is the de Sitter radius. We also show that
the ``all out'' amplitudes describing multiparticle production from the vacuum
are identically zero, hence Bunch-Davies vacuum is stable with respect to the
matter interactions. We show that at the tree level, all scattering amplitudes
are infrared finite, well-defined functions of quantum numbers. They have no
kinematic singularities, except for the processes involving conformally coupled
scalars.

### [31] [Renormalization Group Running of CPT Operators In Lorentz-Violating Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25488)
*Brett Altschul*

TL;DR: The paper discusses the renormalization group behavior of discrete operators (C, P, T) in a Lorentz-violating theory with a $f^{
u}$ term in the action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper motivated the study of the renormalization group behavior of discrete operators (C, P, T) in the context of Lorentz-violating theories, highlighting the implications for high-energy electron-photon processes.

Method: The method involved analyzing the scale dependence of the operators' renormalization group equations in a Lorentz-violating framework, considering both conventional and specific schemes for the $f^{
u}$ term.

Result: The study found that while the operators can exhibit nontrivial renormalization group behavior, it is always possible to set the scale dependence parameter $X$ to zero. However, for certain processes, using a scheme with $X=1$ provides definite scale dependence for C, P, and T, which may be more convenient.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the choice of scheme for handling the $f^{
u}$ term can simplify analyses of high-energy electron-photon processes by fixing the scale dependence parameter $X$ to a nonzero value, making certain theoretical explorations more tractable.

Abstract: In conventional relativistic quantum field theory, the discrete operators C,
P, and T are matrix operators with no renormalization scale dependence.
However, in a Lorentz-violating theory with a fermion $f^{\mu}$ term in the
action, these operators may acquire nontrivial renormalization group behavior.
Because the $f^{\mu}$ term may actually be exchanged in the action for an
equivalent $c^{\nu\mu}$ term, the scale dependence depends explicitly on the
renormalization scheme, even at one-loop order. The scheme dependence means it
is always possible to set the scale dependence parameter $X$ to zero, but for
analyses of some high-energy electron-photon processes, using a scheme with
$X=1$--and thus definite scale dependence for C, P, and T--may nonetheless be
more convenient.

Abstract: We study the relativistic quantum dynamics of spin-0 particles in the
spacetime of a spinning cosmic string that carries both spacelike disclination
(conical deficit $\alpha$) and screw dislocation (torsion $J_z$), as well as
frame dragging ($J_t$). Using the Feshbach-Villars (FV) reformulation of the
Klein-Gordon equation, we obtain a first-order Hamiltonian with a
positive-definite density, enabling a clean probabilistic interpretation for
bosons in curved or topologically nontrivial backgrounds. In the weak-field
regime (retaining terms $\mathcal{O}(G)$ and discarding the $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$
contribution that would otherwise lead to double-confluent Heun behavior),
separation of variables in a finite cylinder of radius $R_0$ yields a Bessel
radial equation with an effective index $\nu(\alpha, J_t, J_z; E, k)$ that
mixes rotation and torsion. The hard-wall condition $J_\nu(\kappa R_0) = 0$
quantizes the spectrum, $E_n^2 = m^2 + k^2 +
\left(\frac{j_{\nu,n}}{R_0}\right)^2$. Working in the stationary
positive-energy sector, we derive closed-form normalized eigenfunctions and FV
density, and we evaluate information-theoretic indicators (Fisher information
and Shannon entropy) directly from the FV probability density. We find that
increased effective confinement (via geometry/torsion) enhances Fisher
information and reduces position-space Shannon entropy, quantitatively linking
defect parameters to localisation/complexity. The FV framework thus provides a

Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect for a massless scalar field confined
between two parallel semitransparent mirrors in a vacuum modified by
spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. Using Green's function techniques and a
point-splitting evaluation of the stress-energy tensor, we compute the vacuum
expectation value of the energy density $T_{00}$. After a suitable
renormalization, the Casimir energy is obtained as the difference between the
vacuum configurations with and without the mirrors. We derive closed-form
expressions that generalize the conventional result by simultaneously
incorporating the mirror transparency and the Lorentz-violating background. Our
analysis shows that the effect of transparency and Lorentz violation consists
of a multiplicative correction and an effective rescaling of the plate
separation, thereby modifying the functional dependence of the energy on the
distance. Beyond the formal derivation, we discuss possible physical
realizations of this framework, emphasizing anisotropic media such as nematic
liquid crystals (e.g., 5CB), where uniaxial dielectric properties could emulate
the Lorentz-violating background. Numerical estimates for such systems
illustrate the phenomenological impact of our results and open the possibility
of constraining Lorentz-violating coefficients through precision Casimir
measurements.

Abstract: By worldsheet approach, $n$-point one-loop integrand can be expressed as a
combination of $(n+2)$-point tree-level bi-adjoint scalar (BS) amplitudes under
forward limit. The integrands constructed by this approach have two closely
related features that are different from conventional Feynman diagrams. First,
the denominators of loop propagators are linear functions of the loop momentum.
Second, the local vertex expression is not manifest. In our previous work, a
systematic approach was proposed to handle the nonlocal terms in the one-loop
integrand of Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) theory. Upon canceling the nonlocalities,
quadratic propagator forms of both YMS and Yang-Mills (YM) integrands are
naturally obtained. In this paper, we generalize the calculation to theories
involving gravitons by introducing the one-loop double Yang-Mills-scalar (dYMS)
integrands. The cancellation of the nonlocalities of the dYMS integrand in the
forward limit coincides with the emergence of local multi-point vertices. We
provide two equivalent methods for extracting the vertices and give the final
expression of the dYMS integrand with quadratic propagators. In this formula,
tree-level effective subcurrents, which exhibit double-copy structures, are
attached to the loop propagator line via the local vertices constructed. The
quadratic propagator formulas for Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) and gravity (GR)
integrands are further derived, by the help of the formula for dYMS. The
extraction of local vertices in one-loop dYMS integrand also applies at
tree-level, thus we have the corresponding expressions of tree-level dYMS, EYM,
and GR amplitudes.

### [36] [Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25801)
*Brandon Holton*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild double copy for the Schwarzschild solution, showing that while the symmetries collapse to global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors, proper conformal Killing vectors reveal an infinite-dimensional algebra that is BRST-exact, ensuring quantum consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: String Symmetry Analysis: The study of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild framework is motivated by understanding the underlying symmetries of spacetime solutions in general relativity and their implications for quantum gravity.

Method: Differential Geometry and Algebraic Methods: The authors use techniques from differential geometry, particularly focusing on Killing vectors and conformal Killing vectors, along with BRST cohomology to analyze the symmetries and their implications on the solution structure.

Result: The main result is that the infinite-dimensional conformal Killing vectors, while initially problematic, form BRST-exact modes, meaning they do not contribute physical degrees of freedom. This provides a consistent quantum description of the Kerr-Schild double copy, limiting the physical spectrum to global isometries.

Conclusion: This work clarifies the role of conformal symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy and establishes the quantum consistency of the framework by demonstrating that non-physical modes are eliminated through BRST exactness.

Abstract: We complete our investigation into the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild
double copy for the Schwarzschild solution. In Part I, we showed that the
infinite-dimensional residual gauge algebra collapses to the finite-dimensional
global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors. Here, we extend the
analysis to proper conformal Killing vectors (CKVs), solving the field
equations via the method of characteristics to obtain explicit conformal
solutions. While asymptotic flatness and horizon regularity remove divergent
contributions, the surviving components form a non-trivial infinite-dimensional
algebra, revealing a structural mismatch with the canonical Schwarzschild
solution. We resolve this by constructing a unified, Weyl-compensated BRST
complex, showing that the infinite-dimensional modes are BRST-exact and do not
correspond to physical degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the quantum
consistency of the Kerr-Schild double copy, confirming that the physical
spectrum is restricted to global isometries.

Abstract: We construct a model of 3D quantum gravity based on abelian topological
quantum field theory (TQFT), by defining the gravitational path-integral as a
sum over all 3D topologies with genus-$g$ boundary $\Sigma_g$. The
path-integral of an abelian TQFT $\mathcal T$ on any single topology with
boundary $\Sigma_g$ prepares a stabilizer state. This way, $\mathcal T$
partitions all these topologies into finitely many equivalence classes, where
each topology within a class is associated with the same stabilizer state. The
gravitational path-integral can thus be rephrased as a weighted sum over
representative topologies, which are further organized into orbits under the
mapping class group of $\Sigma_g$. One orbit is represented by handlebodies,
whose average reproduces the ``Poincar\'e series of the vacuum", while
additional orbits describe non-handlebody topologies. The resulting quantum
gravity state is $Sp(2g,\mathbb Z)$-invariant and can be expressed as a
weighted average of 2D CFT partition functions on $\Sigma_g$. This establishes
a duality between a weighted sum over bulk topologies and a weighted sum over
boundary CFTs. We introduce the ``$\lambda$-matrix", which relates bulk and
boundary weights. The $\lambda$-matrix can be fully determined by the set of
topological boundary conditions that the TQFT admits, and we present a
systematic procedure to construct this set. Using this framework, we evaluate
the $\lambda$-matrix and the TQFT gravity state in several tractable examples.

Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the classical and quantum
chaos in a candidate five-dimensional hairy AdS soliton. It is a horizonless
geometry holographically dual to a confining field theory with finite scalar
potential. We probe classical chaos by using particle geodesics and closed
classical string. While the former shows no signature of chaos, the latter
provides chaotic dynamics of the string using the Lyapunov exponent and the
evolution of the Poincar\'e section. Further we perform an independent spectral
analysis using the tools of the random matrix theory (RMT), namely the level
space distributions and the Dyson-Mehta(DM) $\Delta_{3}$-statistics. We observe
a clear transition from the low energy Wigner-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble
(GOE) distribution to the high energy Poisson distribution. This signifies a
flow from quantum chaos in the infrared to integrability in the ultraviolet. We
quantitatively characterize the inherent quantum scrambling in the dual theory
by computing the butterfly velocity, the rate of spatial spread of the
information scrambling, inside the bulk. We undergo two independent holographic
methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction and derivation of
out-of-time-ordered correlators via shockwave analysis. In these methods, we
heuristically treat the region near the soliton tip to analyse the infrared
physics of scrambling similarly as done in the near-horizon region of black
hole. We find that the hair parameter controls various scrambling properties.
Finally, we make comments on the interplay between insulator/superconductor
phase transition in hairy soliton geometry and dynamical transition from
integrability to chaos as both of these are affected by the presence of the
hair parameter.

Abstract: Holography implies scattering in the bulk can be mediated by entanglement on
the boundary. The connected wedge theorem (CWT) of May, Penington, and Sorce is
a concrete example where bulk scattering implies correlation between certain
boundary regions. However the converse does not hold. We investigate a recent
proposal of Leutheusser and Liu for a generalization of the CWT with converse.
We prove the forward direction: having pairs of CFT ``input'' (and likewise
``output'') regions in a phase with connected entanglement wedge implies that a
particular bulk subregion (the intersection of ``input'' and ``output''
entanglement wedges) is non-empty. We then establish a modified version of the
proposal which has a converse, and identify counter-examples to the stronger
conjecture.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a class of nonlocal conformal field theories in two dimensions which
are obtained as deformations of the Virasoro minimal models. The construction
proceeds by coupling a relevant primary operator $\phi_{r,s}$ of the $m$-th
minimal model to a generalized free field, in such a way that the interaction
term has scaling dimension $2-\delta$. Flowing to the infrared, we reach a new
class of CFTs that we call long-range minimal models. In the case $r=s=2$, the
resulting line of fixed points, parametrized by $\delta$, can be studied using
two perturbative expansions with different regimes of validity, one near the
mean-field theory end, and one close to the long-range to short-range
crossover. This is due to a straightforward generalization of an infrared
duality which was proposed for the long-range Ising model ($m = 3$) in 2017. We
find that the large-$m$ limit is problematic in both perturbative regimes,
hence nonperturbative methods will be required in the intermediate range for
all values of $m$. For the models based on $\phi_{1,2}$, the situation is
rather different. In this case, only one perturbative expansion is known but it
is well behaved at large $m$. We confirm this with a computation of infinitely
many anomalous dimensions at two loops. Their large-$m$ limits are obtained
from both numerical extrapolations and a method we develop which carries out
conformal perturbation theory using Mellin amplitudes. For minimal models,
these can be accessed from the Coulomb gas representations of the correlators.
This method reveals analytic expressions for some integrals in conformal
perturbation theory which were previously only known numerically.

Method:  studied semi-classical emission of fermions using a $	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace	hinspace$ model with a Yukawa-like interaction.

Result:  found that fermion pair production contributes significantly to the decay compared to scalar radiation alone.

Conclusion:  provides evidence that fermion-mediated decay can enhance scalar radiation processes in certain models.

Abstract: The amplitude of an excited shape mode in a kink is expected to decay with a
well-known power law via scalar radiation emission due to the nonlinear
self-coupling of the scalar field. In this work we propose an alternative decay
mechanism via pair production of fermions in a simple extension of the $\phi^4$
model in which the scalar field is coupled to a (quantum) fermionic field
through a Yukawa-like interaction term. We study the power emitted through
fermions as a function of the coupling constant in the semi-classical limit
(without backreaction) and compare it to the case of purely scalar radiation
emission.

Abstract: Conformal defects spontaneously break part of the symmetry algebra of a bulk

defect soft theorems. Our derivation is elementary, allowing us to easily
reproduce and generalize constraints on displacement and tilt operators
previously obtained in the literature as well as a plethora of new ones,
including constraints on bulk-defect correlation functions. For line defects we
rewrite constraints in dispersive sum rule form, showing they lead to exact,
optimal bounds on the OPE data of the defect. We test these sum rules in
concrete perturbative examples, finding perfect agreement with existing
calculations and making new predictions for various dCFT data.

Abstract: We study the low-energy dynamics of systems with exact and approximate
higher-form symmetries using gauge/gravity duality. These symmetries are
realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive
$p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory
are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved
higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised
framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged
operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified
holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime
dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute
thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to
characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual
boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation
dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional
electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results
extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and
open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes

Abstract: Recently, novel crystalline constructions known as Cayley-Schreier lattices

topological invariants in a single setup. We underpin these general results
with concrete models and show how they can be implemented in current
experimental platforms. Our work sets the stage for a systematic investigation
of topological insulators and metals with non-Abelian gauge structures.

Abstract: We demonstrate that in an ideal Weyl semimetal, in which the Fermi energy
coincides with the band-touching nodes, weak direct inter-nodal scattering is
irrelevant and, as a result, the chiral charge is (almost) exactly conserved.
This leads to an experimentally-observable effect: in an applied magnetic
field, the charge transport along the field becomes purely ballistic, with the
conductance given by $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum through the sample
cross-section. This is the strongest experimental manifestation of nontrivial
topology in Weyl and Dirac semimetals.

Abstract: Neurodynamic behavior of artificial neuron circuits made of Mott memristors
provides versatile opportunities to utilize them for artificial sensing. Their
small size and energy efficiency of generating spiking electrical signals
enable usage in fully implantable cochlear implants. Here, we propose an
auditory sensing unit realized by a piezo-MEMS (micro-electromechanical
systems) cantilever connected to a VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based
oscillator circuit. This auditory sensing unit is capable of
frequency-selective detection of vibrations and subsequent emission of a neural
spiking waveform. The auditory sensing unit is tested under biologically
realistic vibration amplitudes, and spike rate-encoding of the incoming
stimulus is demonstrated, similarly to natural hearing processes. The
tunability of the output spiking frequency and the shape of the spiking
waveform are also demonstrated to provide suitable voltage spikes for the
nervous system.

Abstract: The orbital degree of freedom has recently attracted significant attention
due to the novel phenomena it enables in condensed matter systems. However, the
interpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles
remains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of
orbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons
and phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in
bosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion
of the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the
latter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional
antiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum
geometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking,
yielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM.
We propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage
generated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the
bosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the
emerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge
between phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding
magnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital
degrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical
control of magnetization and phononic transport.

Abstract: The electrical control of pure spin current remains a central challenge in
spintronics, particularly in time-reversal symmetric systems composed of
nonmagnetic elements, where spin and electric fields interact only indirectly.
In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for electrically tuning pure
spin photocurrent in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry via
a gate electric field. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in
systems with spin-orbit coupling and in-plane mirror symmetry, an out-of-plane
electric field induces spin splitting and reversal in the band structure near
the Fermi energy, enabling magnitude control and direction reversal of the pure
spin photocurrent. To validate this mechanism, we perform first-principles
calculations on germanene, an experimentally realized two-dimensional material.
Beyond amplitude modulation, we reveal that reversing the direction of the
applied electric field leads to a corresponding reversal of the pure spin
photocurrent. Furthermore, we show that the pure spin photocurrent can be tuned
by varying the photon energy and the incident angle of light, providing
additional degrees of control over spin transport. These findings establish a
robust strategy for electric-field-controlled pure spin transport in
two-dimensional materials, offering new possibilities for the development of
optospintronic devices.

TL;DR: Ultra-small Josephson junctions lose phase coherence due to noise and damping, but can be restored under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the coherence properties of superconducting devices is crucial for optimizing their performance and functionality in various applications.

Method: We examined the coherence properties of atomic-scale Pb-Pb Josephson junctions in a scanning tunneling microscope under microwave excitation, observing the effects of thermal fluctuations, magnetic adatoms, and AC driving on phase coherence.

Result: Increasing the AC amplitude reduces phase coherence due to thermal fluctuations. Magnetic adatoms lower the Josephson coupling energy and enhance quasi-particle tunneling. AC driving causes a rapid suppression of coherence attributed to photon-assisted quasi-particle tunneling through Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. These findings reveal that while dissipation is detrimental to phase coherence, it can be counteracted by controlling external parameters like temperature and magnetic fields.

Conclusion: This study provides direct evidence of phase coherence in ultra-small Josephson junctions and highlights the role of dissipation in their transport properties, offering insights into the design and operation of nanoscale superconducting devices.

Abstract: Ultra-small Josephson junctions are strongly influenced by noise and damping
due to energy dissipation into the environment, which are expected to suppress
phase coherence. Here, we investigate the coherence properties of atomic-scale
Josephson junctions in a scanning tunneling microscope under microwave
excitation. Plain Pb-Pb junctions exhibit hysteretic Shapiro steps as signature
of a coherent resonant state. With increasing AC amplitude, phase coherence is
reduced due to an increase of thermal fluctuations. In the presence of magnetic
adatoms the Josephson coupling energy is reduced and quasi-particle tunneling
is enhanced. With AC driving we observe a rapid suppression of coherence that
we ascribe to photon-assisted quasi-particle tunneling through Yu-Shiba-Rusinov
states. Our results highlight the presence of phase coherence and shed light on
the origin of the transition to incoherent transport, thereby revealing the
importance of controlling dissipation in nanoscale superconducting devices.

Abstract: Much attention has been devoted to the use of machine learning to approximate

hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space
topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and
generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a
tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying
the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights
the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Altermagnets possess two key features: non-relativistic alternating spin
splitting (i.e., altermagnetism) and a material-dependent N\'{e}el vector. The
former naturally coexists with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in real
materials on substrates, prompting the question of how SOC affects the magnetic
properties of altermagnets. The latter is crucial for information storage,
making it essential to determine its orientation. To address these issues, we
study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional
(2D) $d$-wave altermagnets by independently varying the N\'{e}el vector
orientation and the SOC strength. Our results demonstrate that the N\'{e}el
vector orientation can be accurately determined via the Ising term without SOC,
or qualitatively inferred via the DM terms with SOC. Moreover, we observe a
novel Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) component distinct from previous reports,
whose emergence is attributed to the synergy between altermagnetism and SOC.
Additionally, through tuning SOC strength, we reveal the evolution of the RKKY
spin models governed by five distinct mechanisms: the spin model may be
determined solely by altermagnetism, solely by SOC, or solely by the kinetic
term; alternatively, altermagnetism may coincidentally yield the same
moderately anisotropic spin model as SOC, or compete with SOC to produce a spin
model with maximal anisotropy. Beyond SOC strength, which mechanism operates
also relies on the N\'{e}el vector orientation and impurity configurations. All
results are numerically verified. These findings -- which were inaccessible in
prior studies due to the limitations of first-order SOC expansion and fixed
N\'{e}el vector orientation -- provide important new insights into the magnetic
properties of altermagnets.

Motivation:  exploration of alternative methods for energy harvesting beyond conventional thermodynamic limits, leveraging quantum systems for improved efficiency.

Method:  experiments using quantum-dot harvester with waste heat from a quantum-point-contact transistor, operated on a non-thermal TL liquid, comparing with quasi-thermalized states.

Result:  higher electromotive force and conversion efficiency when using non-thermal state.

Conclusion:  validation of non-thermal states as beneficial for energy harvesting in quantum systems, suggesting new avenues for efficient energy extraction.

Abstract: Energy harvesting is a technique that generates useful work from waste heat.
Conventional energy harvesters acting on local thermal equilibrium states are
constrained by thermodynamic limits, such as the Carnot efficiency. Quantum
heat engines with non-thermal reservoirs are expected to exceed such limits.
Here, we demonstrate energy harvesting from a nonthermal Tomonaga-Luttinger
(TL) liquid in quantum Hall edge channels, where the non-thermal state is
naturally formed due to the absence of thermalization. The scheme is tested
with a quantum-dot energy harvester working on a non-thermal TL liquid supplied
with waste heat from a quantum-point-contact transistor. Compared to the
quasi-thermalized TL liquid, the non-thermal state prepared under the same heat
is capable of a larger electromotive force and higher conversion efficiency.
These characteristics can be understood by considering a binary Fermi
distribution function of the non-thermal state induced by entropy-conserving
equilibration. TL liquids are attractive non-thermal carriers for excellent
energy harvesting.

Conclusion: 盐梯度为细菌趋宝运动提供了新的调控方式，具有在环境复杂条件下优化微生物导航路径的潜在应用。

Abstract: Bacteria are often required to navigate across confined spaces to reach
desired destinations in biological and environmental systems, allowing critical
functions in host-microbe symbiosis, infection, drug delivery, soil ecology,
and soil bioremediation. While the canonical run-and-tumble motility is
effective in finding targets under confinement, it may not represent the most
ideal strategy due to the continuous monitoring of environmental cues and
stochastic recorrection of their paths. Here, we show that salt gradients can
be exploited to improve the run-and-tumble motility of flagellated soil
bacteria, Pseudomonas putida, by biasing the cells' motion toward salt. Salt
gradients impact bacterial swimming by straightening their runs toward salt,
which we attribute to diffusiophoresis acting asymmetrically around the cell.
This action imposes an effective torque on the cell body that is strong enough
to overcome Brownian rotation, thereby stabilizing the motion and guiding the
cells toward salt with straighter runs. We further demonstrate that imposing
salt gradients in the presence of toxic organic contaminants enhances their
chemotactic dispersion toward the contaminants via diffusiophoresis, suggesting
its potential utility in bioremediation. Our findings reveal a previously
unrecognized mechanism by which salt gradients can bias bacterial motility,
offering new opportunities to control microbial transport in complex
environments.

Abstract: This work presents a rigorous statistical and geometric framework for
analyzing turbulence-impacted beam propagation and image topology with results
obtained using a PMMA slab. The approach models beam intensity distributions as
n-dimensional data set represented through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs),
embedding them into the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices.
By employing information geometric tools, geodesic distances, and
affine-invariant Riemannian metrics, we establish a principled methodology for
quantifying similarity and dissimilarity among beam images. Experimental
results demonstrate topological distance trends, distance statistics, and
correlation measures for different turbulence scenarios, including polarized
and unpolarized cases. Histograms of distance statistics reveal stable
statistical features, with correlation coefficients highlighting the
turbulence-induced variability in PMMA-based beam propagation. The framework
not only provides a systematic foundation for analyzing optical beam statistics
under turbulence but also opens avenues for advanced applications such as deep
learning-based feature reduction, image compression, and secure free-space
optical (FSO) communication. Future directions include refining the GMM-EM
based distance measures, comparative scatter analysis, and developing robust
statistical tools for turbulence imaging. Overall, this study bridges
theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and potential technological
applications in adaptive and applied optics.

TL;DR: This paper validates a new method for tuning specifically the emission of plasmonic nanoparticles via applying static magnetic fields, which is a significant advancement toward realizing tunable nanoscale light sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the need to develop methods for controlling the emission of plasmonic nanoparticles, which are important for various applications in optics and sensing.

Method: The researchers used planar plasmonic tunnel junctions and applied a static magnetic field to observe the modulated electroluminescence. They combined experiments with theoretical models to explain the results.

Result: Applying a magnetic field of a few Teslas caused a 10-20% modulation in the electroluminescence of the tunnel junctions, much larger than what would be expected from the Hall effect.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that static magnetic fields can significantly influence the optical response of plasmonic nanoparticles, opening up new possibilities for creating tunable light sources with precise control.

Abstract: Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metal nanoparticles have been
studied extensively through scattering and absorption. Static magnetic
field-induced changes in plasmonic far-field response stem from the classical
Hall effect and are generally very small in noble metals within the visible
frequency range at readily accessible magnetic fields. Planar plasmonic tunnel
junctions allow the study of nanogap LSPRs through current-driven light
emission. We find that the electroluminescence of such junctions is modulated
by tens of percent with a magnetic field of a few Teslas, exceeding Hall-based
expectations by orders of magnitude. Complementary quantum mechanical and
electromagnetic modeling reveals that a modest static magnetic field can
introduce significant chirality in the transition dipoles generated during the
electron tunneling process. This strongly affects the excitation of LSPRs and
leads to magnetic-field sensitive far-field electroluminescent emission. This
is a new paradigm for tunable nanoscale light sources.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) utilizes a pair of broadband mutually coherent
laser frequency combs to enable high-resolution, high-accuracy spectroscopic
measurements with atomic-clock-level frequency referencing, and rapid,
multiplexed acquisition without moving parts. It has traditionally been
confined to specific domains: terahertz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet,
each requiring distinct comb sources and detection mechanisms tailored to the
nature of the spectroscopic target. Yet, similar techniques may be implemented
in the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions, such as optical
rectification for comb generation and electro-optic sampling for detection,
both using crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. However, in the Reststrahlen
band near phonon resonances in these crystals, typically between 5 and 10 THz,
both linear and nonlinear susceptibilities experience abnormally high
dispersion, and light propagation is strongly suppressed. This confines DCS
operation to spectral regions either below or above the Reststrahlen band and
effectively separating the THz and MIR domains. Here we demonstrate
high-resolution DCS performed simultaneously over two broad spectral bands,
each spanning an octave or more. The measurements cover both the MIR (350-1150
cm$^{-1}$; 8.7-28.5 $\mu$m; 10.5-34.5 THz) and the THz region (80-160
cm$^{-1}$; 62.5-125 $\mu$m; 2.4-4.8 THz), effectively bridging these
traditionally separate regions within a single acquisition. This enables direct
cross-referencing of molecular absorption line strengths across widely
separated spectral domains. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the
simultaneous acquisition of ro-vibrational and pure rotational absorption
spectra of ammonia (NH$_3$) with a spectral resolution of 7.3 MHz (0.00024
cm$^{-1}$), sufficient to fully resolve Doppler-broadened line shapes across
the entire measured spectral range.

Result: The composite design achieved a significant improvement in gate fidelity, reducing the average error probability by nearly a factor of two and decreasing variability by fivefold. The residual error was primarily limited by photon indistinguishability. Classical matrix reconstruction confirmed improved alignment with the ideal CNOT operation.

Conclusion: Composite segmented directional couplers (CSDC) represent a promising and scalable solution for improving the performance of photonic quantum circuits by enhancing gate fidelity while maintaining compactness, passivity, and foundry compatibility.

Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits are a promising platform for scalable quantum
information processing, but their performance is often constrained by component
sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Directional couplers, which are
crucial building blocks for integrated quantum logic gates, are particularly
prone to such limitations, with strong dependence on geometric and spectral
parameters which reduces gate fidelity. Here, we demonstrate that composite
segmented directional couplers (CSDC) offer a fabrication-tolerant alternative
that enhances gate fidelity without active tuning. We design and fabricate a
fully integrated photonic controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate using both uniform and
composite coupler variants and compare their performance via simulation,
classical characterization, and quantum two-photon interference. The composite
design reduces the average error probability by nearly a factor of two and
decreases variability fivefold. The residual error is primarily limited by

Abstract: Photon interconversion in semiconductors is of fundamental importance for
digital imaging and quantum sensing. Nonlinear processes such as
triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) offer photon upconversion (UC) at yields
desired for solid-state optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a multilayer
molecular system where a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer facilitates robust
photon UC. A molecular stack of squaraine DIB-SQ: 6,6-Phenyl C61 butyric acid
methyl ester (PCBM) is optimized for UC by fine tuning the PCBM loading to
engineer charge transfer states that facilitate further triplet generation.
This composite NIR photosensitizer layer, at a 1:3 blend ratio in
heterojunction with rubrene, drives triplet population density to levels
desired for effective TTA. When paired with a fully optimized annihilator layer
of tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) doped rubrene, the NIR sensitizer
produces a photon upconversion quantum yield of 1.36% at 690 nm, with a
significantly low excitation intensity threshold for the onset of the linear
regime.. Time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption spectroscopy,
and magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a detailed
balance of photoexcited states and formation of charge transfer states of
triplet character (3CT), which work in tandem with molecular states to
sensitize the triplet state (T1) of rubrene. This approach of harnessing
near-infrared photons presents promising avenue for advancing solid-state
photon interconversion.

Abstract: Optical Vector Analysers (OVA) are critical for emerging technologies such as
integrated photonics and optical positioning. Achieving a sensitivity near the
Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) while acquiring a wide spectrum allows an accurate
measurement of targets that are fragile, non-linear, or that scatter most of
the probe light away. Existing OVAs operate with a sensitivity orders of
magnitude below the SQL. In this paper, we use a free-running interferometer
with a frequency range of 20 THz as an OVA. We introduce novel methods to
mitigate the phase noise and obtain a unit signal-to-noise ratio for powers at
the fW level. We apply this technique towards quantifying the fabrication
quality of microring resonators in thin-film Lithium Niobate. Our
characterisation yields a signal-to-noise ratio above 1 with much less than 1
circulating photon and reveals a quality factor above 5 millions, unambiguously
attributed to low internal losses.

Abstract: Extracting photons from defect centers is challenging due to the high
refractive index of typical substrates. For nitrogen-vacancy centers in
diamond, reaching saturation count rates above
$2.5\times10^5\,\mathrm{counts}/\mathrm{s}$ so far requires nanofabricated
optics like diamond waveguides or solid immersion lenses. Here we present an
experimental and theoretical study of defect center emission at unmodified
planar dielectric surfaces by quantitative back focal plane imaging and
analytical modeling. Our results indicate that photon count rates approaching
those of nanofabricated optics can also be achieved by oil-immersion optics.
This is due to a dielectric antenna effect which directs the majority of the
emission into the substrate within a narrow angle window suitable for back-side
collection. By quantifying the collection efficiency of back-side detection,
our work also enables a novel measurement method for the quantum efficiency of
shallow defect centers. Its result challenges established values. Possible
reasons for the discrepancy are discussed.

TL;DR: The paper investigates exciton-polariton condensation in square arrays of dielectric silicon and plasmonic silver nanodisks, highlighting key differences in symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) and their implications for lasing and polariton confinement in both materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is to understand the role of material properties in controlling exciton-polariton condensation and its applications in quantum computing and polaritonic circuitry.

Method: The research employs theoretical simulations to analyze the optical properties of the arrays, focusing on mode coupling and interference effects in both dielectric silicon and plasmonic silver nanodisk arrays.

Result: The results show that the material-specific differences in mode coupling lead to distinct behaviors in the BICs, with dielectric silicon exhibits polariton condensation in a $Q_{xy}$ BIC producing a donut-shaped k-space emission, while plasmonic silver supports hybrid polariton modes confined along the polarization axis in real space. Importantly, both materials exhibit similar lasing thresholds and polariton confinement under unpolarized conditions.

Conclusion: This study offers a novel approach to controlling polariton condensation and confinement through material selection, which could advance quantum computing and polaritonic device applications.

Abstract: We investigate exciton-polariton condensation in square arrays, composed of
either dielectric silicon (Si) or plasmonic silver (Ag) nanodisks, covered with
a dye-doped layer. Both arrays support symmetry-protected bound states in the
continuum (BICs) at normal incidence, featuring electric quadrupolar ($( Q_{xy}
$)) and magnetic dipolar ($( m_z $)) characters. Due to differences in mode
coupling, these BICs are split by $(\sim 10$) meV in the Si array, whereas they
remain nearly degenerate in the Ag array. Simulations reveal that interference
in the Ag array results in hybrid modes, $((m_z + i\tilde{Q}_{xy})$) and $((m_z
- i\tilde{Q}_{xy})$), which are polarized along orthogonal directions.
Interestingly, this results in similar lasing thresholds in both Si and Ag
arrays, regardless of the inherent non-radiative losses of Ag, and also a
confinement of the polariton condensates in the Ag array. While condensation in
the Si array occurs in the $( Q_{xy} $) BIC, producing a characteristic
donut-shaped far-field emission in k-space, condensation in the Ag array
populates the hybrid modes, leading to a double-cross emission pattern
extending over a broad range of wave vectors due to the quasi-flatband nature
of this mode. As a result, the Ag array also exhibits a strong confinement
along the polarization axis in real space. However, for unpolarized emission,
there is a similar spatial confinement in both Si and Ag arrays. This control
over the confinement of condensates could also be exploited to control
interactions. Our results highlight a novel mechanism for condensate
confinement with potential applications in quantum computing and polaritonic
circuitry.

Abstract: Capturing molecular dynamics in nanoconfined channels with high
spatiotemporal resolution is a key challenge in nanoscience, crucial for
advancing catalysis, energy conversion, and molecular sensing. Bottom-up
ultrathin plasmonic nanogaps, such as nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) structures,
are ideal for ultrasensitive probing due to their extreme light confinement,
but their perceived sealed geometry has cast doubt on the existence of
accessible transport pathways. Here, counterintuitively, we demonstrate that
ubiquitous ligand-capped NPoM-type nanogaps can form a natural
quasi-two-dimensional nanochannel, supporting molecular transport over
unprecedented length scales ($\gtrsim5$ $\mu$m) with an extreme aspect ratio
($>10^3$). Using wavelength-multiplexed Raman spectroscopy, we resolve the
underlying centripetal infiltration pathway with a spatial resolving power of
$\sim$20 nm. This redefines the NPoM architecture as a sensitive,
\textit{in-situ}, all-in-one "transport-and-probe" platform, enabling
real-time, reusable monitoring of analyte with $\sim$10$^{-11}$ M. This work
establishes a versatile new platform for advancing super-resolved

Abstract: Non-diffracting optical beams are essential tools in photonics, enabling
robust light transport, super-resolution imaging, and spatiotemporal control.
While nonlocal metasurfaces have been proposed for structured-light generation
due to their broad angular dispersion and topological characteristics,
experimental generation of a non-diffracting beam with nonlocal metasurfaces
has not been demonstrated. Here we experimentally realize vortex Bessel beams
using a nonlocal metasurface and establish a direct link between
non-diffracting-beam generation and photonic band curvature. Depending on the
sign of the curvature, the beams exhibit spatially asymmetric non-diffraction,
emerging either in front of or behind the metasurface. This asymmetry arises
from a radial phase gradient in momentum space, which induces effective space
compression or expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate wavelength-dependent
tunability of the beam diameter and propagation distance, and show an
order-of-magnitude enhancement in propagation distance compared to conventional
Laguerre--Gaussian modes. These results position nonlocal metasurfaces as a
compact, tunable platform for spatiotemporally controlled non-diffracting
light.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fresnel incoherent correlation holography (FINCH) is a
self-interference-based incoherent digital holography method. In FINCH, light
from an object point is split into two beams, modulated differently using two
lenses with different focal distances, and creates a self-interference
hologram. At least three phase-shifted holograms are recorded and synthesized
into a complex hologram, which reconstructs the object image without twin image
and bias noises. Compared with conventional imaging, FINCH exhibits a longer
depth of focus (DOF) and higher lateral resolution. In this study, we propose
and demonstrate a new method termed post-engineering of axial resolution in
FINCH (PEAR-FINCH), which enables post-recording DOF engineering for the first
time. In PEAR-FINCH, a library of FINCH holograms catalogued with unique axial
characteristics, DOF, and focus location is recorded by changing the focal
distance of one of the diffractive lenses. Selected holograms from this library
are combined to engineer new axial characteristics not achievable in FINCH. A
two-step reconstruction, involving numerical back-propagation and deconvolution
with a point spread hologram, is implemented. Experiments with multiplane
objects having large axial separations confirm that PEAR-FINCH achieves a
substantially extended DOF compared with direct imaging and FINCH. PEAR-FINCH
will be promising for applications in biomedical imaging, holography, and
fluorescence microscopy.

Motivation: The study aims to investigate crystallization techniques for thin a-Ge films for applications in photostable materials.

Method: The researchers used a multilayer amorphous Si/Ge structure, subjected it to ultrashort (70 fs) mid-IR laser pulses, and analyzed the process using Raman spectroscopy.

Result: Thinner a-Ge films (3.5 nm) crystallized via stress-induced melting, while thicker films (10 nm+) showed reduced crystallization. This is attributed to the islet structure forming nanopores in thin films, reducing stress confinement during heating.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into controlling crystallization in thin amorphous films for tailored electronic applications.

Abstract: Ultrashort pulsed laser annealing is an efficient technique for crystallizing
amorphous semiconductors with the possibility to obtain polycrystalline films
at low temperatures, below the melting point, through non-thermal processes.
Here, a multilayer structure consisting of alternating amorphous silicon and
germanium films was annealed by mid-infrared (1500 nm) ultrashort (70 fs) laser
pulses under single-shot and multi-shot irradiation conditions. We investigate
selective crystallization of ultrathin (3.5 nm) a-Ge film, promising for the
generation of highly photostable nanodots. Based on Raman spectroscopy
analysis, we demonstrate that, in contrast to thicker (above 10 nm) Ge films,
explosive stress-induced crystallization is suppressed in such ultrathin
systems and proceeds via thermal melting. This is likely due to the islet
structure of ultrathin films which results in the formation of nanopores at the
Si-Ge interface and reduces stress confinement during ultrashort laser heating.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of miniaturizing optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) for practical use in next-generation photonics.

Method: An integrated OPA on thin-film lithium niobate is designed and fabricated. A second-harmonic-resonant architecture is employed with pump recirculation to enhance efficiency and power utilization. The design achieves 95% pump conversion efficiency and effectively increases the pump power.

Result: The device demonstrates over 110 nm bandwidth, quantum-limited noise performance, and an order-of-magnitude improvement in power efficiency compared to previous designs.

Conclusion: This work enables practical on-chip OPAs for quantum and classical applications, overcoming previous technological limitations.

Abstract: Optical amplifiers are fundamental to modern photonics, enabling
long-distance communications, precision sensing, and quantum information
processing. Erbium-doped amplifiers dominate telecommunications but are
restricted to specific wavelength bands, while semiconductor amplifiers offer
broader coverage but suffer from high noise and nonlinear distortions. Optical
parametric amplifiers (OPAs) promise broadband, quantum-limited amplification
across arbitrary wavelengths. However, their miniaturization and deployment has
been hampered by watt-level power requirements. Here we demonstrate an
integrated OPA on thin-film lithium niobate that achieves >17 dB gain with <200
mW input power -- an order of magnitude improvement over previous
demonstrations. Our second-harmonic-resonant design enhances both pump
generation efficiency (95% conversion) and pump power utilization through
recirculation, without sacrificing bandwidth. The resonant architecture
increases the effective pump power by nearly an order of magnitude compared to
conventional single-pass designs, while also multiplexing the signal and pump.
We demonstrate flat near-quantum-limited noise performance over 110 nm. Our
low-power architecture enables practical on-chip OPAs for next generation
quantum and classical photonics.

Abstract: Photonic inverse design and, especially, topology optimization, enable

Here, we design and fabricate arrays of CMOS-compatible silicon cavities on
sapphire with extreme subwavelength transverse mode sizes of only 30-40 nm
($\rm V\sim\lambda^3/2500$). These cavities are engineered for deterministic
coupling to a monolayer (or few-layer) excitonic material, producing strong
near-field localization directly beneath the 2D material. Photoluminescence
(PL) measurements show reproducible tenfold enhancements relative to bare
silicon, consistent with numerical simulations that account for material
absorption and fabrication tolerances. Furthermore, time-resolved PL
measurements reveal pronounced lifetime shortening and non-exponential
dynamics, indicating cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions. The
optimized cavity geometry enhances the far-field collection efficiency and
supports scalable integration with van der Waals semiconductors. Our results
show that the arrays of topology-optimized dielectric cavities are a versatile,
scalable platform for controlling excitonic emission and interactions, which
creates new opportunities in nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, and quantum
photonics.

Abstract: In this communication, we examine new formalisms for the construction of the
external space when correlating reference wavefunctions built from
nonorthogonal determinant expansions. Defining the external space in
nonorthogonal approaches is challenging, as every substitution from the
reference wavefunction can potentially mix both internal and external
configurations. As a result, post-nonorthogonal methods are plagued by internal
contamination and linear dependencies in the external space, which may lead to
correlation double counting that results from overlap of the external and
reference spaces. Removal of these internal configurations and
orthonormalization of the excited space basis can be computationally expensive.
In particular, as the excitation operators cannot be subdivided by their action
on orbital subspaces, the external space cannot be partitioned into
non-overlapping subsets as is possible in orthogonal methods. To resolve these
issues, we propose both uncontracted and internally-contracted approaches based
on a natural excitation framework that allows for reduced scaling, more
straightforward separation of excitation types that lead to external and
internal spaces, and allows for a facile translation of orthogonal methods to a
nonorthogonal framework. Several proofs are provided to illustrate the
viability of the proposed approach, using a method-agnostic presentation to
highlight the generality of the approach.

Abstract: Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed
for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses
are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density
matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing
works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining
high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both
numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering
the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose
a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density
in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural
networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to
achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems
up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric
models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing
system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis
sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge,
this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally
transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench
dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this
promising direction.

Abstract: The groundbreaking advance in materials and chemical research has been driven

Motivation: (Investment in strategic infrastructure) is to fund a research project focused on understanding the vibrational modes of water molecules in complex molecular systems.

Method: The researchers developed a computer program based on classical hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations and applied it to simulate two-dimensional correlation spectra of vibrational modes in liquid water, optimizing grid selection and numerical integration for GPU processing.

Result: The code successfully simulates the two-dimensional terahertz-Raman signals of interacting vibrational modes and is available in supplementary material.

Conclusion: This computational framework provides a valuable tool for studying complex vibronic interactions in condensed-phase molecular systems, particularly in water.

Abstract: The multimode Brownian model with nonlinear system-bath coupling offers a
flexible framework for studying both intra- and intermolecular vibrational
modes in condensed-phase molecular systems. This approach allows us to
calculate linear and nonlinear spectra of molecular vibrations and to examine
thermal effects-such as anharmonicity, energy relaxation, and dephasing-as
reflected in the spectral peak profiles. In this study, we present a computer
program based on classical hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations applied to
three vibrational modes of a molecular liquid. The primary objective of
developing this code was to simulate the two-dimensional correlation spectrum
of the intramolecular modes of liquid water. [R. Hoshino and Y. Tanimura, J.

grid selection and numerical integration routines for graphics processing units

resulting two-dimensional terahertz-Raman signals. The code and example

Abstract: In X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), shake-up satellites arise when
core ionization is accompanied by simultaneous charge-neutral valence
excitations. Although these satellites can contain detailed structural
information, they are rarely interpreted due to the lack of accurate and
scalable theoretical methods. Here, we develop and apply a many-body
perturbation theory framework within the $GW$ plus cumulant ($GW+C$) approach
that enables accurate predictions of shake-up satellites in large molecular
systems. For unfused, mono-fused, and doubly fused porphyrin derivatives with
up to 170 atoms, we achieve excellent agreement with experiment, reproducing
both main photoionization signals and satellite features within $0.2-0.3$ eV.
We show that ring fusion strongly affects satellite features, whereas the N 1s
photoionization signals remain unchanged. Our calculations reveal the mechanism
behind these changes, identifying the spatial localization of valence
excitations as the driving force. This work not only deepens understanding of
the shake-up mechanism in porphyrins but also shows how predictive computations

### [78] [Are neural scaling laws leading quantum chemistry astray?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26397)
*Siwoo Lee,Adji Bousso Dieng*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Scaling foundation models in quantum chemistry reveals significant limitations in capturing basic molecular interactions, regardless of dataset size or model capacity.Operative Insights:1. Model performance heavily depends on the inclusion of dissociating diatomic geometries in training data.2. Even large models fail to generalize core Coulombic principles, highlighting critical gaps in scaling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how to scale foundation models effectively in quantum chemistry is crucial for advancing chemical accuracy and enabling extrapolative capabilities. This research explores the limitations of scaling by testing model generalization on fundamental molecular interactions.

Method: The study employs systematic scaling of quantum chemical models across increasing dataset sizes and model capacities. Key metrics include model performance on dissociation energy curves, specifically assessing the ability to predict the bond dissociation energy of H₂.

Result: Models trained only on stable structures fail to generalize, showing poor qualitative predictions of the H₂ energy curve. Including dissociating geometries improves predictions but does not resolve fundamental issues. The largest models, despite extensive training, fail to capture basic Coulombic interactions, indicating a need for improved scaling strategies in learning fundamental scientific principles.

Conclusion: Scaling alone is insufficient to build reliable quantum chemical models. Incorporating dissociating geometries and better encoding Coulombic interactions are essential for advancing molecular modeling accuracy.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws are driving the machine learning community toward
training ever-larger foundation models across domains, assuring high accuracy
and transferable representations for extrapolative tasks. We test this promise
in quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum
chemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting
models' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the
simplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model
capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even
qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and
stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions
roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models
trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating
diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most
strikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two
bare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved
in electronic structure theory. These results suggest that scaling alone is
insufficient for building reliable quantum chemical models.

Abstract: We identify and characterize a first-order dark-state phase transition
between a discrete dark soliton and a uniform superfluid in a Bose-Hubbard
chain with a single lossy site. Using classical-field (truncated-Wigner)
simulations together with a Bogoliubov stability analysis, we show that the
dark-state nature of the soliton suppresses fluctuations and shifts the
critical point relative to the comparable phenomenon of optical bistability in
driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. We then demonstrate that this mechanism
quantitatively captures the bistability phase boundary observed in the
experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 235302 (2016)],
resolving substantial discrepancies in prior modeling efforts. Our results
reveal how driving, dissipation and quantum coherence can interact to induce

Abstract: The pursuit of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems has unveiled
new physics beyond the conventional Hermitian paradigm, yet their realization
in interacting many-body platforms remains a critical challenge. Exploring this
interplay is essential to understand how strong interactions and dissipation
collectively shape topological phases in open quantum systems. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate non-Hermitian spectra topology in a dissipative
Rydberg atomic gas and characterize parameters-dependent winding numbers. By
increasing the interaction strength, the system evolves from Hermitian to
non-Hermitian regime, accompanying emergence of trajectory loop in the complex
energy plane. As the scanning time is varied, the spectra topology becomes
twisted in the complex energy plane manifesting as a topology phase transition
with the sign winding number changed. When preparing the system in different
initial states, we can access a nontrivial fractional phase within a parameter
space that globally possesses an integer winding. Furthermore, by changing the
scanning direction, we observe the differentiated loops, revealing the breaking
of chirality symmetry. This work establishes cold Rydberg gases as a versatile
platform for exploring the rich interplay between non-Hermitian topology,
strong interactions, and dissipative quantum dynamics.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper investigates localization properties in a system of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chains coupled to uniform or clean chains via inter-chain hopping. The key findings are phase transitions between delocalized, intermediate, and localized states as the non-Hermiticity parameter and inter-chain coupling strength vary. An interesting intermediate phase, the non-Hermitian comb effect (NHCE), is identified, where localized and extended states coexist without a clear mobility edge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the localization properties in non-Hermitian quantum systems is crucial for advancing the field of quantum physics, particularly in the context of topological phases and quantum transport phenomena. The study of coupled chains can provide insights into the effects of non-Hermiticity on wavefunction behavior and phase transitions.

Method: The authors employ a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Analytical techniques are used to derive an approximate expression for the non-Hermitian comb effect, while numerical methods such as diagonalization and density of states calculations are employed to identify and characterize different phases in the system.

Result: The simulation results confirm the analytical predictions, showing phase transitions between delocalized, intermediate (NHCE), and localized states. The NHCE is characterized by the coexistence of extended and localized states in the intermediate phase, with no clear mobility edge.

Conclusion: The research reveals the rich phase diagram of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems when coupled, with distinct phases exhibiting unique localization properties. The coexistence of extended and localized states in the NHCE phase opens new avenues for studying such phenomena in quantum systems.

Abstract: We study localization properties in a system of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic
chain coupled to a uniform chain or clean chain by inter-chain hopping. We find
that in the limit of weak inter-chain coupling, such a coupled system exhibits
transitions from delocalized to intermediate phase with increase in the
non-Hermiticity parameter. However, for stronger inter-chain coupling
strengths, the delocalized phase undergoes a transition to localized phase and
then to an intermediate phase. Interestingly, the intermediate phase in this
case exhibits the non-Hermitian comb effect (NHCE), i.e., the coexistence of
localized and extended states rather than being well separated from each other
by any mobility edge which is conventional in any intermediate phase. We
further show that such a NHCE originates from the isolated site limit of the
quasiperiodic chain and provide an analytical explanation supporting the
numerical signatures.

TL;DR: A compact gamma-ray detector module with 4x4 SiPMs and three scintillators (GAGG, YSO, BGO) was developed. They achieved good linearity, but GAGG and YSO showed slight saturation beyond ~2000 keV, while BGO provided stable linearity up to 2500 keV but had reduced sensitivity below 300 keV. Energy resolution was acceptable, with 8.17% for GAGG, 9.3% for YSO, and 10.2% for BGO. These results highlight trade-offs between sensitivity, linearity, and dynamic range for compact gamma-ray spectroscopy applications across the 32 keV-2500 keV range.

Motivation: Gamma-ray spectroscopy is crucial for various applications like nuclear medicine and geology. Compact detectors are desirable for portability and cost-effectiveness.

Method: A 4x4 array of SiPMs was coupled with three scintillators (YSO, GaGG, BGO). The performance was evaluated over an energy range of 32 keV to 2500 keV using standard gamma-ray sources.

Result: All configurations showed good linearity, but limitations in SiPM occupancy affected YSO and GAGG above ~2000 keV. BGO supported stable linearity up to 2500 keV, though sensitivity decreased below 300 keV. Energy resolutions were consistent with expected values, confirming suitable configurations for compact gamma-ray spectroscopy.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights into selecting scintillators for compact gamma-ray spectroscopy applications, emphasizing the balance between energy resolution, dynamic range, and sensitivity.

Abstract: A compact gamma-ray detector module was developed and characterized for
spectroscopic applications across a wide energy range. The detector comprises a
4x4 array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs, Hamamatsu MPPC S13360-3050)
coupled with three different inorganic scintillators (YSO, GaGG, BGO). The
performance of the detector was evaluated over an energy range from 32 keV to
2500 keV using various standard gamma-ray point sources ({241}Am, {137}Cs,
{22}Na, {60}Co, {228}Th). All three detector configurations demonstrated
linearity between pulse height and gamma-ray energy over most of the tested
range. GAGG exhibited the most consistent linear behavior up to 2500 keV. YSO
with a faster decay constant showed linearity up to ~2000 keV, followed by
slight saturation effects likely due to SiPM microcell occupancy limits at
higher photon flux. BGO, characterized by a low light output and longer decay
time, demonstrated stable linearity up to 2500 keV but reduced sensitivity
below 300 keV. The measured energy resolution at 662 keV was 8.17% for GAGG,
9.3% for YSO, and 10.2% for BGO, consistent with their light yield and photon
detection efficiency (PDE) - matching characteristics. The obtained results
showed the trade-offs between scintillator materials in terms of energy
resolution, dynamic range, and linearity, and confirm the suitability of the
tested configurations for compact gamma-ray spectroscopy applications across
the studied energy range.

Abstract: Achieving tritium self-sufficiency is a critical challenge for future fusion
power plants. The BABY 1L experiment, part of the LIBRA project at MIT, aims to
benchmark tritium breeding and release in molten salt breeder systems under
deuterium-tritium (DT) neutron irradiation. Building on the initial
\SI{100}{mL} campaign, BABY 1L introduces a tenfold increase in breeder volume,
improved thermal and gas handling systems, and enhanced neutron diagnostics,
including a proton recoil telescope. We report on results from four irradiation
experiments using sealed-tube DT neutron generators, with tritium collected by
water bubblers measured via liquid scintillation counting. Experimentally
determined Tritium Breeding Ratios (TBRs) were compared to OpenMC neutronics
simulations, showing very good agreement. The measured TBR values demonstrate a
six-fold improvement over the \SI{100}{mL} experiments, largely attributed to
the increased solid angle and improved measurement fidelity. We also
investigate tritium release dynamics and identify diffusion-limited transport
as the dominant regime in the salt volume in the temperature range 630-750
\si{\celsius}. Additionally, we observe that the introduction of hydrogen in
the helium carrier gas significantly accelerates tritium release, consistent
with an isotopic exchange mechanism. All analysis is conducted through the
open-source \texttt{libra-toolbox} \cite{libra-toolbox}, which streamlines
simulation, data processing, and validation across experimental campaigns.
These results provide critical insights into the design and operation of future
liquid breeder systems and demonstrate the maturity of the BABY platform as a
testbed for tritium breeding studies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A novel CZT-based micro-activity dose calibrator has been designed via Monte
Carlo simulation (GATE) to accurately measure low-level activity 225Ac for
targeted alpha therapy (TAT) application. Because even small overdoses in TAT
can induce severe local toxicity, activities in the microcurie down to
nanocurie regime are often required, and accurate activity measurement by dose
calibrators is a priori to safe and effective treatment. Standard dose
calibrators, or high-pressurized gas-filled ionization chambers, are not
suitable in this range due to limited sensitivity and lack of energy
discrimination. To address this, we designed a CZT-based micro-activity
calibrator that (i) adopts a box-shaped well geometry to obtain higher
solid-angle coverage and (ii) applies time-coincident pixel-level clustering to
recover full-energy-peak net counts otherwise lost to multi-site Compton
scattering. Using GATE, serial dilutions from 1.0 uCi down to 1e-6 uCi were
simulated, activities were reconstructed from the 218 and 440 keV gamma peaks
and performance was compared against a NaI(Tl) well counter, which serves as an
alternative to standard dose calibrator. Across six orders of magnitude, the
CZT-based micro-activity dose calibrator exhibited near-unity linearity (slope
m=0.9934) with percent-level bias, whereas the NaI(Tl) counter showed
systematic under-response under identical conditions. These results indicate
that a CZT-based approach can provide accurate low-activity quantification for
TAT, motivating forthcoming hardware validation.

Abstract: A new comprehensive study on the Cs${_2}$ZrCl${_6}$ (CZC) crystal
scintillating properties under different types of irradiation was performed
over a wide temperature range from 5 to 300 K. The light yield (LY) at room
temperature (RT), measured under irradiation by 662 keV $\gamma$ quanta of
$^{137}$Cs, was evaluated to be 53,300$\pm$4,700 photons/MeV corresponding to
approximately 71% of its estimated absolute value. The maximum light emission
was observed in the temperature interval 135-165 K, where the LY reached 56,900
photons/MeV and 19,700 photons/MeV for $\gamma$ quanta and $\alpha$ particles,
respectively. The quenching factor (QF) for $\alpha$ particles increases
smoothly from QF = 0.30 at RT to QF = 0.36 at 135 K. The shape of scintillation
pulses induced by $\alpha$ particles is characterized by three time-constants
(0.3, 2.5 and 11.8 $\mu$s at RT), whereas the average pulse of $\gamma$ induced
events is characterized by two time-constants (1.3 and 11.5 $\mu$s at RT). At
the same time, scintillating properties and pulse-shape discrimination
capability of the CZC exhibit an acute deterioration at temperatures below 135
K. The optimal operating conditions to maximize the scintillating performance
of undoped CZC crystals are discussed.

Motivation: The need to ensure the integrity and performance of detector components in high-stakes environments like the LHC motivates this research into understanding and mitigating potential defects.

Method: The authors describe a series of quality control and assurance tests, specifically focusing on the identification and analysis of pinholes caused by improper electrical connections in the module assembly process.

Result: The study reveals that pinholes have a minor impact on module testing and performance, and the researchers introduce novel methods for detecting affected strips.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that existing testing procedures can be adjusted to accommodate the issue without compromising the functionality of the modules.

Abstract: In preparation for the High-Luminsoity LHC (HL-LHC), the ATLAS detector will
undergo major detector upgrades, including the replacement of the current Inner
Detector with the new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk). The ITk consists of a
pixel detector close to the beamline surrounded by a large-area strip detector.
During detector production, the electrical properties of silicon sensors and
readout electronics must be characterized through a series of quality control
(QC) and quality assurance tests. These tests ensure any defect is captured at
the earliest possible stage. One such defect, called a pinhole, occurs when the
strip implant and the metal readout electrode are shorted through the
intermediary dielectric layer. Notably, the introduction of pinholes during
module assembly and pinhole effects on completed modules, especially on leakage
current measurement circuitry, have never been studied. In this paper, we
investigate the effect of such connections on the sensor leakage current
measurements of completed modules and introduce new ways to locate pinholed
strips. With minor modifications to testing procedures, such defects are shown
not to impede module testing or performance.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in the field of "mechanical computing" is the creation
of truly reprogrammable mechanical structures, where the function of each unit
can be dynamically defined, modified, and accessed on demand, much like
rewriting data on a hard drive. Prior efforts have largely focused on bistable
building blocks, which mimic binary states, but robust and efficient methods
for programming large arrays of such units remain limited. In this study, we
introduce a new approach for defining and reconfiguring the state of mechanical
bits. Specifically, we investigate arrays of pendula whose boundary conditions
break symmetry, effectively transforming them into mechanical bits. When
actuation times are short compared to the natural oscillation periods, the
state of each pendulum can be controlled solely by adjusting the timing of
global boundary conditions. This mechanism enables rapid reprogramming,
arbitrary information writing, and even the construction of a "mechanical
piano" capable of generating user-defined note and chord sequences within only
a few oscillation cycles. Because it integrates seamlessly with diverse
functionalities, our strategy establishes a scalable framework for
reprogrammable mechanical systems and can be readily generalized to other
oscillatory systems like membranes or beams.

Abstract: We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to
bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing
possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might
nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that
superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality,
provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is,
once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large.
In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined
ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of
driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise
to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in
this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We
further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of
spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are
obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim
et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime

Abstract: We develop a theory of the non-equilibrium current response for metallic
systems near quantum critical points where electronic quasiparticles
fractionalize, such as systems near continuous metal-insulator transitions or
composite Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid transitions. Applying a generalized
response theory within a Keldysh path integral framework, we derive a
non-perturbative current noise composition law, wherein the total noise is the
sum of the noise of each fractionalized constituent (bosonic holons and
fermionic spinons), weighted by their respective resistivities. We demonstrate
that the formally derived composition relations can be interpreted in terms of
a simple analogy with resistors in series. We leverage this composition rule
near certain quantum critical points to show that the shot noise can be
suppressed in long nanowires as compared to Fermi liquid expectations due to
the collusion of quantum criticality with fractionalization.

Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the
non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model and XXZ model with the staggered
imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization,
respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity,
mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and
self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal
entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be
capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ
model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In
addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its
effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the
Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed
through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably,
the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional
points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find
that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity
strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
regime of the XXZ model.

*Daiki Sasamoto,Joji Nasu*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores the quantum spin liquid behavior in the S=1 Kitaev model using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, addressing anisotropic spin interactions to determine bosonic quasiparticle properties and spin structure factors. Two decoupling schemes are compared, with a proposed alternative improving physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum spin liquids and spin excitations in extended Kitaev models is crucial for advancing quantum materials research. This paper aims to provide a mean-field framework for these systems, particularly addressing anisotropy.

Method: Schwinger boson mean-field theory is applied, introducing fractional quasiparticles via bond operators. Two decoupling schemes are compared: traditional spinon-based and bond operator-based.

Result: The bond operator-based decoupling provides more accurate momentum dependence in spin structure factors than traditional spinon-based methods. The temperature evolution of the dynamic spin structure factor shows distinct structures developing at higher temperatures, linked to spinon bandwidth narrowing.

Conclusion: This work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum spin liquids in Kitaev models and offers a refined mean-field approach for studying these exotic systems.

Abstract: The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model with a quantum spin liquid
ground state. While this model was originally proposed as an $S=1/2$ spin model
on a honeycomb lattice, extensions to higher-spin systems have recently
attracted attention. In contrast to the $S=1/2$ case, such higher-$S$ models
are not exactly solvable and remain poorly understood, particularly for spin
excitations at finite temperatures. Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model,
which is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles. We investigate this model
using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, introducing bosonic spinons as
fractional quasiparticles by extending bond operators to address anisotropic
spin interactions. We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a
quantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models.
Based on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure
factors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with
respect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong
spectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in
the antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we
propose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond
operators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior
disappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is
consistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the
temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the
zero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature
increases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of
spinons. Finally, we clarify why the two decoupling schemes result in different
momentum dependences and discuss their relationship to previous studies.

*Michelle Ocker,Franziska Walther,Nour Maraytta,Matthieu Le Tacon,Michael Merz,Cornelius Krellner,Kristin Kliemt*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper discusses the single crystals of EuPd₃Si₂, confirming its orthorhombic crystal structure but revealing differences in lattice parameters from previous work. The material exhibits two magnetic transitions, indicating antiferromagnetic ordering below 61 K and spin reorientation at 40 K. Magnetic anisotropy is observed with moments aligning along [100] between 61 K and 40 K, and canting away below 40 K. AFM order below 61 K is noted instead of ferromagnetism at higher temperatures. Changes in structure, composition, or defects may influence magnetic coupling constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's focus on structural, magnetic, and compositional properties, along with its findings on magnetic transitions and anisotropy, suggests an interest in understanding the complex magnetic behavior of EuPd₃Si₂ crystals. The differentiation from previous studies may highlight the importance of crystallographic and chemical factors in determining magnetic coupling constants.

Method: Single crystals were grown using a high-temperature EuPd-flux method. Techniques such as single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, Laue method, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used for structural and chemical characterization. Thermal properties like heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility were measured to study magnetic transitions. Magnetic anisotropy was analyzed using temperature-field phase diagrams and susceptibility data.

Result: The study confirms the orthorhombic crystal structure of EuPd₃Si₂ but finds discrepancies in lattice parameters from prior research. Two magnetic transitions were observed: antiferromagnetic ordering below 61 K and spin reorientation at 40 K. Magnetic anisotropy was characterized with moments aligning along [100] between 61 K and 40 K, and canting away below 40 K. AFM order below 61 K was identified, differing from the ferromagnetic behavior reported in previous studies by Sharma et al., possibly due to structural, compositional, or defect-related changes.

Conclusion: The research provides a comprehensive characterization of EuPd₃Si₂ crystals, highlighting structural, magnetic, and compositional insights. The findings emphasize the role of crystallographic and chemical factors in determining magnetic properties, with implications for future studies on similar compounds.

Abstract: Single crystals of EuPd$_3$Si$_2$ were grown using a high-temperature
EuPd-flux method. The material was structurally and chemically characterized by
single-crystal x-ray diffraction, powder x-ray diffraction, Laue method and
energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The structural analysis confirmed the
orthorhombic crystal structure (space group $Imma$) but revealed differences in
the lattice parameters and bond distances in comparison to previous work by
Sharma et al.. The composition is close to the ideal 1:3:2 stoichiometry with
an occupation of 7 % of the Si sites by Pd. The heat capacity, electrical
resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility show two magnetic transitions
indicating antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N1}= 61\,\rm K$ and a spin
reorientation at $T_{\rm N2}= 40\,\rm K$. The orthorhombic material shows
magnetic anisotropy with field applied along the three main symmetry axes,
which is summarized in the temperature-field phase diagrams. The susceptibility
data hint to an alignment of the magnetic moments along $[100]$ between $T_{\rm
N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$. Below $T_{\rm N2}$ the magnetic structure changes to an
arrangement with moments canted away from $[100]$. In contrast to published
work by Sharma et al., the single crystals investigated in this study show AFM
order below $T_{\rm N1}$ instead of ferromagnetism that sets in at higher
$T_{\rm C1}=78\,\rm K$ which might originate from certain differences in the
structure, composition or defects that have an impact on the dominant coupling
constants of the RKKY interaction.

Abstract: We performed high-field magnetization, magnetocaloric effect (MCE), and NMR
measurements on the Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet
Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$. The observations of the 1/3-magnetization plateau, the
split NMR lines, and the thermal activation behaviors of the spin-lattice
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ between 2 T and 15.8 T provide unambiguous evidence of
a gapped up-up-down (UUD) magnetic ordered phase. For fields between 15.8 T and
18.5 T, the anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility, the slow saturation of the
NMR line spectral ratio with temperature, and the power-law temperature
dependence of $1/T_1$ suggest the ground state to be a spin supersolid with
gapless spin excitations. With further increasing the field, the Gr\"{u}neisen
ratio, extracted from the MCE data, reveals a continuous quantum phase
transition at $H_{\rm C}\approx$ 19.5 T and a universal quantum critical
scaling with the exponents ${\nu}z~\approx~$1. Near $H_{\rm C}$, the large
high-temperature MCE signal and the broad peaks in the NMR Knight shift and
$1/T_1$, manifest the strong spin fluctuations driven by both magnetic
frustration and quantum criticality. These results establish
Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ as a candidate platform for cryogenic magnetocaloric
cooling.

Motivation: 对称性在量子物理中扮演着核心角色，特别是在复杂量子系统中的动态演化过程中。研究ABA作为对称性恢复的直接 probe，有助于理解热化效应和信息 scrambling的机制。

Method: 使用精确对角化方法，在cSYK模型中从对称性不对称的乘积态进行quench，计算ABA和熵的演化。利用数理工具分析ABA的动态行为及其与纯度的关系。

Result: ABA快速减少并趋于稳定，表明系统进入无序环境后迅速达到局部热化态。量子Mpemba效应被观察到，系统越远离对称性，ABA减少越快。利用 Pinsker type界，ABA的减少与子系统纯度提升相关，提示ABA是对称性恢复的重要指标。

Conclusion: ABA在研究对称性恢复与热化效应方面具有重要意义。通过ABA可以追踪量子系统如何达到局部热化态，特别是有限尺寸系统中的相变行为。

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration
-- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in
the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (cSYK) model with a conserved U(1) charge.
Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement
entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric
product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with
the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent
decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size
effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual
cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum
Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach
lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more
robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower
bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity,
identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism.
These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry
restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in
fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.

Abstract: The interplay between electronic correlations and band topology is a central
theme in modern condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the
effects of on-site Hubbard interactions on the topological, magnetic, and
quantum geometric properties of the Creutz ladder, a paradigmatic model of a
one-dimensional topological insulator. Using a self-consistent mean-field
approach, we uncover a first-order, interaction-driven phase transition that is
simultaneously magnetic and topological. We demonstrate that as the Hubbard
interaction $U$ is increased, the system's ground state abruptly switches from
an anti-ferromagnetic (AF) configuration to a ferromagnetic (F) one. This
magnetic transition coincides with a topological transition, marked by a
quantized jump in the Zak phase from $\pm\pi$ to $0$. We systematically compute
the phase diagrams in the parameter space of on-site energy staggering
($\epsilon$) and inter-chain hopping asymmetry ($\lambda$), revealing the
critical interaction strength $U_c$. Furthermore, we analyze the quantum
geometry of the Bloch states by calculating the Fubini-Study metric,
demonstrating that its components exhibit divergences that precisely signal the
topological phase transition. By analyzing the full energy spectrum, we
distinguish the true ground state from metastable excited states that emerge
past the critical point. Our results establish the Creutz-Hubbard ladder as a
minimal model for studying interaction-induced topological phenomena and
suggest a potential route for controlling magnetic, topological, and geometric
properties via electronic correlations.

Abstract: In one-dimensional p-wave superconductors with short-range interactions,
topologically protected Majorana modes emerge, whose mass decays exponentially
with system size, as first shown by Kitaev. In this work, we extend this
prototypical model by including power law long-range interactions within a
self-consistent framework, leading to the self-consistent long-range Kitaev
chain (seco-LRKC). In this model, the gap matrix acquires a rich structure
where short-range superconducting correlations coexist with long-range
correlations that are exponentially localized at both chain edges
simultaneously. As a direct consequence, the topological edge modes hybridize
even if their wavefunction overlap vanishes, and the edge mode mass inherits
the asymptotic scaling of the interaction. In contrast to models with imposed
power law pairing, where massive Dirac modes emerge for exponents $\nu < d$, we
analytically motivate and numerically demonstrate that, in the fully
self-consistent model, algebraic edge mode decay with system size persists for
all interaction exponents $\nu > 0$, despite exponential wave function
localization. While the edge mode remains massless in the thermodynamic limit,
finite-size corrections can be experimentally relevant in mesoscopic systems
with effective long-range interactions that decay sufficiently slowly.

Abstract: Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated
collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are
related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear
altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number
of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform
magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band
filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining
phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge
density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide
parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and
altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of
spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split
fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We
discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the

Abstract: A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous
transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts
pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to
external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward
as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum
critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely
unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum
critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of
superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the
transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is
accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a
particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state,
and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies
photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological
performance.

Conclusion:  this paper presents a novel solution to the challenges in cryogenic qubit control. the multiplexed photonic receivers combined with cryogenic CMOS provide a cost-effective, scalable alternative to coaxial cables and other current methods, paving the way for efficient large-scale quantum computing.

Abstract: Current control techniques for cryogenically cooled qubits are realized with
coaxial cables, posing multiple challenges in terms of cost, thermal load,

include cryogenic CMOS electronics at 4 K, and photonic links for direct qubit

interface for direct qubit control utilizes optical or sub-THz bands. We
present the possible tradeoffs of this platform, and compare it with current
state-of-the-art cryogenic CMOS and conventional coaxial approaches. We assess
the feasibility of adopting these efficient links for a wide range of microwave
qubit power levels. Specifically, we estimate the heat load to achieve the
required signal-to-noise ratio SNR considering different noise sources,
component losses, as well as link density. We show that multiplexed photonic
receivers at 4 K can aggressively scale the control of thousands of qubits.
This opens the door for low cost scalable quantum computing systems.

Method: Used Quantum Computer: Quantinuum H2 Quantum Computer; Code: [4,2,2] code; Technique: Converting detected logical errors into random resets; Processes: Simulations of open quantum systems with continuous detection (rate equals reset rate); Timing: Near break-even performance at short times.

error detection. In particular, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to
perform logical simulations of a non-equilibrium phase transition using the
[[4,2,2]] code. Importantly, by converting detected errors into random resets,
which are an intended part of the dissipative quantum dynamics being studied,
we avoid any post-selection in our simulations, thereby eliminating the
exponential cost typically associated with error detection. The encoded
simulations perform near break-even with unencoded simulations at short times.

Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, is
vital for the realization of, e.g., quantum networks, distributed quantum
computing, and quantum repeaters. The microwave-to-optical quantum transduction
is of particular interest in the field of superconducting quantum computing,
since interconnecting dilution refrigerators is considered inevitable for
realizing large-scale quantum computers with fault-tolerance. In this review,
we overview recent theoretical and experimental studies on the quantum
transduction between microwave and optical photons. We describe a generic
theory for the quantum transduction employing the input-output formalism, from
which the essential quantities characterizing the transduction, i.e., the
expressions for the transduction efficiency, the added noise, and the
transduction bandwidth are derived. We review the major transduction methods
that have been experimentally demonstrated, focusing the transduction via the
optomechanical effect, the electro-optic effect, the magneto-optic effect, and
the atomic ensembles. We also briefly review the recent experimental progress
on the quantum transduction from superconducting qubit to optical photon, which
is an important step toward the quantum state transfer between distant
superconducting qubits interconnected over optical fibers.

Abstract: Rydberg atoms have great potential for microwave (MW) measurements due to
their high sensitivity, broad carrier bandwidth, and traceability. However, the
narrow instantaneous bandwidth of the MW receiver limits its applications.
Improving the instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver is an ongoing challenge.
Here, we report on the achievement of an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth MW
receiver via a linear array of scalable Rydberg vapor cells with Stark comb,
where the Stark comb consists of an MW frequency comb (MFC) and a
position-dependent Stark field. In the presence of the Stark field, the
resonance MW transition frequency between two Rydberg states is position
dependent, so that we can make each MFC line act as a local oscillator (LO)
field to resonantly couple one Rydberg cell. Thus, each cell receives part of a
broadband MW signal within its instantaneous bandwidth using atomic heterodyne
detection, achieving the measurements of the broadband MW signal
simultaneously. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the MW
receiver with 210~MHz instantaneous bandwidth using an MFC field with 21 lines.
Meanwhile, we achieve an overall sensitivity of 326.6~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$.
In principle, the method allows for achieving an arbitrary instantaneous
bandwidth of the receiver, provided we have enough MFC lines with enough power.
Our work paves the way to design and develop a scalable MW receiver for
applications in radar, communication, and spectrum monitoring.

Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a
non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As
illustrated by Wigner, all symmetries forming a group structure (and hence
invertible) must be either unitary or antiunitary. Relinquishing this
assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of
quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates
that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective}
unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This
extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space
to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby
broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum
theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how,
in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may
be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being
used.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are a key platform for quantum
sensing and quantum information, combining long coherence times with
controllable spin-spin interactions. Most of current quantum algorithms rely on
optical access, which limit device integration and applicability in opaque or
miniaturized settings. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical approach,
photocurrent double electron-electron resonance (PC-DEER), permitting
exploiting local dipolar interactions between individual NV spin qubits or
ensembles and nearby paramagnetic defects with sub-confocal resolution. PC-DEER
extends photocurrent NV readout from single-spin to spin-bath control and
coherent manipulation, enabling characterization of bath-induced noise and
effective deployment of noise-reduction protocols. We resolve the signatures of
substitutional nitrogen (P1) and NVH centers with reproducible contrast by
using electrical signals. Our results establish a scalable, optical-free spin
readout strategy that bridges fundamental studies of spin environments with
deployable quantum technologies, advancing the integration of diamond-based
sensors into solid-state quantum devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum
chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly
complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a
phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called
$\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a
holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator
remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body
system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related
concept of $\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a
phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding
is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding
under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and
size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and
(ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\lambda_L \leq 2
\alpha$ (with $\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\alpha$ the growth rate),
which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not
saturate this bound, with $h = \lambda_L / 2\alpha <1$, the winding with Pauli
size $\ell$ becomes $\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\ell^{1/h}$. We
illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
(SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model.

Abstract: As present day quantum hardware is limited by various noise mechanisms,
quantum advantage can only be reached in the near-term by designing
noise-resilient quantum algorithms. In this work, we employ state-of-the-art
quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to characterize the noise channels
of IBM quantum processors under realistic runtime constraints. As our main
application, we compare the Trotter time-evolution of three- and four-qubit
wave functions to a compressed quantum circuit version of the same evolution
operator. By analysing the spectral properties of the two process channels, we
find that the compressed circuit systematically yields larger eigenvalue
moduli, demonstrating better noise resilience.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that all-to-all Hamiltonians provide a highly efficient method for simulating quantum circuits, significantly outperforming traditional methods by factors related to circuit depth and system size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and enhancing the information-processing capabilities of quantum systems through all-to-all interactions is a key objective in both theoretical and experimental quantum physics.

Method: The authors introduce a systematic approach using all-to-all Hamiltonians, achieving faster simulation times by exploiting non-commuting Hamiltonians and diverse physical concepts.

Result: The study reveals that all-to-all Hamiltonians enable quantum computations to be completed in much shorter timescales compared to conventional methods, particularly when considering system size and circuit depth.

Conclusion: This research extends our understanding of quantum circuit simulation, highlighting the potential of all-to-all interactions in advancing quantum computing technologies.

Abstract: All-to-all interactions arise naturally in many areas of theoretical physics
and across diverse experimental quantum platforms, motivating a systematic
study of their information-processing power. Assuming each pair of qubits
interacts with $\mathrm{O}(1)$ strength, time-dependent all-to-all Hamiltonians
can simulate arbitrary all-to-all quantum circuits, performing quantum
computation in time proportional to the circuit depth. We show that this naive
correspondence is far from optimal: all-to-all Hamiltonians can process
information on much shorter timescales.
  First, we prove that any two-qubit gate can be simulated by all-to-all
Hamiltonians on $N$ qubits in time $\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ (up to factor $N^{\delta}$
with an arbitrarily small constant $\delta>0$), with polynomially small error
$1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$. Immediate consequences include: 1) Certain
$\mathrm{O}(N)$-qubit unitaries and entangled states, such as the
multiply-controlled Toffoli gate and the GHZ and W states, can be generated in
$\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ time; 2) Trading space for time, any quantum circuit can be
simulated in arbitrarily short time; 3) Information could propagate in a fast
way that saturates known Lieb-Robinson bounds in strongly power-law interacting
systems.
  Our second main result proves that any depth-$D$ quantum circuit can be
simulated by a randomized Hamiltonian protocol in time
$T=\mathrm{O}(D/\sqrt{N})$, with constant space overhead and polynomially small
error.
  The techniques underlying our results depart fundamentally from the existing
literature on parallelizing commuting gates: We rely crucially on non-commuting
Hamiltonians and draw on diverse physical ideas.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper describes the first continuous-wave (CW) interferometer utilizing quantum resources to achieve Heisenberg scaling, outperforming classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance precision measurement using CW interferometry by integrating quantum resources beyond classical capabilities.

Method: The method involves a Mach-Zehnder interferometer illuminated with squeezed light sources and a nonlinear estimator to extract a differential phase modulation signal.

Result: The interferometer achieves precision scaling faster than classical limits, approaching Heisenberg scaling.

Conclusion: Continuous operation of quantum interferometers is feasible and resource-efficient, surpassing classical scaling limitations in pulsed modes.

Abstract: Continuous-wave (CW) interferometry has stood at the frontier of precision
measurement science since its inception, where it was used to search for the
luminiferous ether, to the present day, where it forms the basis of
interferometric gravitational-wave detection. Quantum theory predicts that this
frontier can be expanded more rapidly by employing certain quantum resources,
compared with the case of using only classical resources. In the quantum case,
we can achieve ``Heisenberg scaling'', which manifests as a quadratic
improvement over the best possible classical precision scaling. Although
Heisenberg scaling has been demonstrated in pulsed operation, it has not been
demonstrated for continuous operation. The challenge in doing so is two-fold:
continuous measurements capable of Heisenberg scaling were previously unknown,
and the requisite CW quantum states are fragile. Here we overcome these
challenges and demonstrate the first CW interferometer exhibiting resource
efficiency approaching Heisenberg scaling. Our scheme comprises a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer illuminated with a pair of squeezed light sources, followed by a
nonlinear estimator of the output homodyne record to estimate a differential
phase modulation signal that drives the interferometer. We observe that this
signal can be extracted with a precision that scales faster than what is
allowed classically, and approaches the Heisenberg scaling limit.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement using the Barnett effect in a spinning ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled with a microwave cavity and an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The scheme involves tuning photon frequency detuning, selecting the cavity-magnon coupling regime, adjusting the nonlinear gain, and controlling the phase shift of the OPA. The results show that increasing the OPA's gain significantly enhances entanglement nonreciprocity and its tolerance to thermal occupation, offering potential applications in quantum information processing and communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonreciprocity is a key resource for quantum technologies, including quantum communication and computation. This paper presents a practical approach to achieve non-reciprocal entanglement, which is essential for advancing these fields, especially under thermal fluctuations.

Method: The authors propose a system involving a spinning ferrimagnetic sphere, a microwave cavity, and an OPA. They utilize the Barnett effect, which induces nonreciprocal spin-magnetic interactions, to generate non-reciprocal entanglement. The method involves tuning several parameters, including photon frequency detuning, cavity-magnon coupling strength, OPA gain, and phase shift.

Result: The study reveals that increasing the OPA's gain significantly enhances the strength of nonreciprocal entanglement and its stability against thermal occupation. The proposed scheme is resilient to thermal fluctuations, making it suitable for practical implementations in quantum technologies.

Conclusion: This work establishes a promising pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices. The findings have broad implications for advancing quantum information processing and communication technologies. The enhanced nonreciprocity under higher gains and despite thermal fluctuations opens new avenues for practical applications in quantum devices.

Abstract: Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals
to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a
method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement via the Barnett effect in a
spinning ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity
that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett
effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. All entanglements with
ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning,
appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain,
and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement
nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced
by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly
enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway
for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential
applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This
proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal
devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an experimental boson sampling-based quantum accelerator for Monte Carlo integration, leveraging importance sampling to enable hybrid quantum-classical computation. The protocol is validated through a proof-of-principle experiment, demonstrating a resource-efficient and accurate method to compute quantum corrections with near-term photonic devices, though it depends on several noise factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently a push to demonstrate practical quantum advantage for near-term quantum devices. Computing Monte Carlo integrals efficiently on quantum hardware represents a promising application in scientific computing. This paper fills the gap by presenting a practical design that leverages quantum-classical hybrid methods, addressing both potential advantages and necessary validations.

Method: The protocol takes a hybrid approach, combining quantum and classical techniques. It uses boson sampling as a quantum accelerator for Monte Carlo integration tasks. Importance sampling is employed to decompose the integrand into a part that can be sampled quantumly and a part that can be computed classically. The quantum device's role is confined to generating samples from a specific probability distribution, while the classical post-processing handles the evaluation-based computation. The method ensures that the problem structure is amenable to quantum-classical integration, with a critical point being that the classical post-processing must be sensitive to high-order quantum correlations for computational hardness.

Result: The proof-of-principle experiment successfully validates the proposed protocol. It computes the first-order energy correction for a three-boson system in a harmonic trap under an Efimov-inspired perturbation. The experimental outcomes are consistent with both theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. The deviations, which explain the experimental accuracy, are attributed to factors such as photon distinguishability, discretization effects, and unitary imperfections in the quantum implementation. Moreover, an error budget is provided, quantifying the impact of these noise sources.

Conclusion: This paper provides a compelling demonstration of a practical quantum-classical hybrid approach to accelerate Monte Carlo integration tasks. It showcases a method that is both resource-efficient and accurate enough for potential real-world applications. However, the practicality and scalability will depend on further addressing noise challenges, such as photon distinguishability and other experimental imperfections.

Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of boson sampling as a hardware
accelerator for Monte Carlo integration. Our approach leverages importance
sampling to factorize an integrand into a distribution that can be sampled
using quantum hardware and a function that can be evaluated classically,
enabling hybrid quantum-classical computation. We argue that for certain
classes of integrals, this method offers a quantum advantage by efficiently
sampling from probability distributions that are hard to simulate classically.
We also identify structural criteria that must be satisfied to preserve
computational hardness, notably the sensitivity of the classical
post-processing function to high-order quantum correlations. To validate our
protocol, we implement a proof-of-principle experiment on a programmable
photonic platform to compute the first-order energy correction of a three-boson
system in a harmonic trap under an Efimov-inspired three-body perturbation. The
experimental results are consistent with theoretical predictions and numerical
simulations, with deviations explained by photon distinguishability,
discretization, and unitary imperfections. Additionally, we provide an error
budget quantifying the impact of these same sources of noise. Our work
establishes a concrete use case for near-term photonic quantum devices and
highlights a viable path toward practical quantum advantage in scientific
computing.

Abstract: Long-range systems, characterized by couplings that decay as a power law
$r^{-\alpha}$, are of fundamental importance and attract widespread interest
across diverse physical phenomena. Among these, bosonic systems are
particularly significant due to their theoretical importance and experimental
relevance. In this Letter, we propose a classical algorithm with a
quasipolynomial runtime to efficiently approximate the partition function of
long-range bosonic systems at high temperatures. For finite-range systems, the
complexity improves to almost polynomial time. We also present a rigorous proof
for the power-law decay of correlation functions. This property, known as
clustering of correlation, is well-established for finite-range spin models.
However, in sharp contrast, has remained largely unexplored for long-range
bosonic systems. The results presented here address two long-standing gaps
concerning the computational complexity and correlation clustering in such
systems. The methodology we introduce provides new tools for future studies of
challenging problems in statistical and quantum many-body physics concerning
bosonic system and computational complexity.

Abstract: Optimizing over separable quantum objects is challenging for two key reasons:
determining separability is NP-hard, and the dimensionality of the problem
grows exponentially with the number of qubits. We address both challenges by
introducing a heuristic algorithm that leverages a quantum co-processor to
significantly reduce the problem's dimensionality. We then numerically
demonstrate that see-saw-type optimization performs well in lower-dimensional
settings. A notable feature of our approach is that it yields feasible
solutions, not just bounds on the optimal value, in contrast to many
outer-approximation-based methods. We apply our method to the problem of
finding separable states with minimal energy for a given Hamiltonian and use
this to define an entanglement measure for its ground space. Finally, we
demonstrate how our approach can approximate the separable ground energy of
Hamiltonians up to 28 qubits.

Abstract: Quantum computers are a revolutionary class of computational platforms with
applications in combinatorial and global optimization, machine learning, and
other domains involving computationally hard problems. While these machines
typically operate on qubits, which are quantum information elements that can
occupy superpositions of the basis states 0 and 1, recent advances have
demonstrated the practical implementation of higher-dimensional quantum systems
(qudits) across various hardware platforms. In these hardware realizations, the
higher-order states are less stable and thus remain coherent for a shorter
duration than the basis 0 and 1 states. Moreover, formal methods for designing
efficient encoder circuits for these systems remain underexplored. This
limitation motivates the development of efficient circuit techniques for qudit
systems (d-level quantum systems). Previous works have typically established
generating gate sets for higher-dimensional codes by generalizing the methods
used for qubits. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework for
optimizing encoder circuits for prime-dimension stabilizer codes. This
framework is based on novel generating gate sets whose elements map directly to
efficient Clifford gate sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method on key codes, achieving a 13-44 percent reduction in encoder circuit
gate count for the qutrit (d = 3) codes [[9,5,3]], [[5,1,3]], and [[7,1,3]],
and a 9-21 percent reduction for the ququint (d = 5) code [[10,6,3]] when
compared to prior work. We also achieved circuit depth reductions up to 42
percent.

*Zhongyi Jiang,Simon Geisert,Sören Ihssen,Ioan M. Pop,Mohammad H. Ansari*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A multi-mode tunable coupler improves gate fidelity in superconducting quantum processors by enabling nonlinear control of qubit interactions, achieving high on-off ratios and suppressing unintended couplings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the fidelity of quantum gates is crucial for scalable quantum computing. Decoupling qubits to prevent unintended interactions is a fundamental challenge in quantum processor design.

Method: The proposed multi-mode coupler uses a nonlinear control mechanism to manipulate interactions across different excitation manifolds. It ensures high efficiency in the one-excitation space while minimizing leakage into the two-excitation space.

Result: The design achieves a high on-off ratio for entangling operations and effectively suppresses residual coupling, leading to improved gate fidelity.

Conclusion: This advancement offers a pathway to achieve scalable and reliable quantum gates, enhancing the practicality of superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Tunable couplers are a key building block of superconducting quantum
processors, enabling high on-off ratios for two-qubit entangling interactions.
While crosstalk can be mitigated in idle mode, conventional single-mode
couplers lack independent control over interactions in the one- and
two-excitation manifolds, leading to unitary errors such as leakage during gate
operations. Moreover, even at the nominal decoupled point, residual
wavefunction delocalization persists, causing unintended qubit-qubit coupling.
Here we propose a multi-mode tunable coupler that enables nonlinear control of
interactions across excitation manifolds, achieving a high on-off ratio in the
one-excitation manifold while suppressing coupling in the two-excitation
manifold. The proposed design also realizes complete localization between
qubits, providing perfect isolation at the decoupled point and opening new
possibilities for scalable, high-fidelity quantum gates.

Method: 研究了两个相互作用的双原子系统，分别计算了有与无Lamb级情況下的热流。

Result: 当温度梯度较小时，Lamb级抑制了热流；当温度梯度较大时，热流受到限制但仅在有Lamb级时才可达最大值，这一发现扩展了量子热力学理论。

Conclusion: Lamb级不 markdown 是量子热流中的关键因素，需纳入量子热力学分析。

Abstract: The Lamb shift as an additional energy correction induced by environments
usually has a marginal contribution and hence is neglected. We demonstrate that
the Lamb shift, which modifies the energy levels, can influence the heat
current to varying extents. We focus on the steady-state heat current through
two coupled two-level atoms, respectively, in contact with a heat reservoir at
a certain temperature. We find that the Lamb shift suppresses the steady-state
heat current at small temperature gradients, while at large gradients, the heat
current is restricted by an upper bound without the Lamb shift but diverges
when it is included. These results not only demonstrate the Lamb shift's
critical role in quantum heat transport but also advance our understanding of
its impact in quantum thermodynamics.

Abstract: Solving the electronic Schr\"odinger equation for strongly correlated systems
remains one of the grand challenges in quantum chemistry. Here we demonstrate
that Transformer architectures can be adapted to capture the complex grammar of
electronic correlations through neural network backflow. In this approach,
electronic configurations are processed as token sequences, where attention
layers learn non-local orbital correlations and token-specific neural networks
map these contextual representations into backflowed orbitals. Application to
strongly correlated iron-sulfur clusters validates our approach: for
$\left[\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{~S}_2\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$
([2Fe-2S]) (30e,20o), the ground-state energy within chemical accuracy of DMRG
while predicting magnetic exchange coupling constants closer to experimental
values than all compared methods including DMRG, CCSD(T), and recent neural
network approaches. For $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_4
\mathrm{S}_4\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([4Fe-4S]) (54e,36o), we
match DMRG energies and accurately reproduce detailed spin-spin correlation
patterns between all Fe centers. The approach scales favorably to large active
spaces inaccessible to exact methods, with distributed VMC optimization
enabling stable convergence. These results establish Transformer-based backflow
as a powerful variational ansatz for strongly correlated electronic structure,
achieving superior magnetic property predictions while maintaining chemical
accuracy in total energies.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a deterministic single-photon source in the terahertz (THz)
regime, triggered by a sequence of coherent optical pulses. The scheme
leverages the permanent dipole moment of a single-polar quantum emitter to
induce THz transitions between optically dressed states, enhanced by a resonant
coupling to a hybrid THz cavity. We present a cavity design that delivers high
efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability while also enabling easy
tunability of the emission frequency across the THz range. A key challenge in
this new class of dressed-state sources is that, unlike standard solid-state
single-photon sources, the dressed nature of the transitions can lead to
undesired optical repumping during emission due to spontaneous photon emission
in the visible range, which reduces the purity of the THz single-photon state.
We show that this issue can be mitigated through optimized pulse areas and a
sufficiently high Purcell rate, criteria that are met by our proposed cavity
design. Finally, we demonstrate the significant purity enhancement of
postselected THz photons by means of optical heralding, illustrating the new
opportunities unlocked by the unique integration of terahertz and visible
technologies with dressed polar quantum emitters.

Conclusion: 该发现为量子计算和量子通信提供了重要的理论框架，并揭示了施特林'er操作与量子态区分之间的深层联系。

Abstract: Quantum state discrimination plays a central role in defining the possible
and impossible operations through a restricted class of quantum operations. A
seminal result by Bennett et al. [Phys. Rev. A 59, 1070 (1999)] demonstrates
the existence of a set of mutually orthogonal separable quantum states that
cannot be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical
communication, a phenomenon known as nonlocality without entanglement. We show
that a parallel structure exists in the resource theory of magic: there exists
a set of mutually orthogonal stabilizer states that cannot be perfectly
distinguished by stabilizer operations, which consist of Clifford gates,
measurements in the computational basis, and additional ancillary stabilizer
states. This phenomenon, which we term 'nonstabilizerness without magic,'
reveals a fundamental asymmetry between the preparation of classically
efficiently simulatable stabilizer states and their discrimination, which
cannot be performed by classically efficiently simulatable quantum circuits. We
further discuss the implications of our findings for quantum data hiding, the
no-cloning of stabilizer states, and unconditional verification of non-Clifford
gates.

Abstract: This work characterises families of guiding states for the Guided Local
Hamiltonian problem, revealing new connections between physical constraints and
computational complexity. Focusing on states motivated by Quantum Chemistry and
Hamiltonian Complexity, we extend prior BQP-hardness results beyond
semi-classical subset states. We demonstrate that broader state families
preserve hardness, while maintaining classical tractability under practical
parameter regimes. Crucially, we provide a constructive proof of BQP
containment for the canonical problem, showing the problem is BQP-complete when
provided with a polynomial-size classical description of the guiding state. Our
results show quantum advantage persists for physically meaningful state
classes, and classical methods remain viable when guiding states admit
appropriate descriptions. We identify a Goldilocks zone of guiding states that
are efficiently preparable, succinctly described, and sample-query accessible,
allowing for a meaningful comparison between quantum and classical approaches.
Our work furthers the complexity landscape for ground state estimation
problems, presenting steps toward experimentally relevant settings while
clarifying the boundaries of quantum advantage.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了现有知识，展示了如何快速构建一致的量子随机单元，这对于理解量子快 scrambling和量子引力模型至关重要。

Abstract: Understanding how fast physical systems can resemble Haar-random unitaries is
a fundamental question in physics. Many experiments of interest in quantum
gravity and many-body physics, including the butterfly effect in quantum
information scrambling and the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, involve
queries to a random unitary $U$ alongside its inverse $U^\dagger$, conjugate
$U^*$, and transpose $U^T$. However, conventional notions of approximate
unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) fail to capture these
experiments. In this work, we introduce and construct strong unitary designs
and strong PRUs that remain robust under all such queries. Our constructions
achieve the optimal circuit depth of $O(\log n)$ for systems of $n$ qubits. We
further show that strong unitary designs can form in circuit depth $O(\log^2
n)$ in circuits composed of independent two-qubit Haar-random gates, and that
strong PRUs can form in circuit depth $\text{poly}(\log n)$ in circuits with no
ancilla qubits. Our results provide an operational proof of the fast scrambling
conjecture from black hole physics: every observable feature of the fastest
scrambling quantum systems reproduces Haar-random behavior at logarithmic
times.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient detection of topological phase transitions in quantum systems.

Method: Propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm using many-body localized quantum evolution and unsupervised clustering of local measurements.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm significantly amplifies quantum state differences, facilitating efficient phase transition detection without complex measurements or full density matrix reconstruction.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, feasible solution for detecting topological phase transitions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, characterizing topological phase transitions
typically requires complex many-body topological invariants, which are costly
to compute and measure. Inspired by quantum reservoir computing, we propose an
unsupervised quantum phase detection method based on a many-body localized
evolution, enabling efficient identification of phase transitions in the
extended SSH model. The evolved quantum states produce feature distributions
under local measurements, which, after simple post-processing and
dimensionality reduction, naturally cluster according to different Hamiltonian
parameters. Numerical simulations show that the evolution combined with local
measurements can significantly amplify distinctions between quantum states,
providing an efficient means to detect topological phase transitions. Our
approach requires neither complex measurements nor full density matrix
reconstruction, making it practical and feasible for noisy intermediate-scale
quantum devices.

Result: The paper presents that while significant progress has been made, integrating quantum electrodynamics remains essential.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that further advancements in ultrafast laser physics will require the reintroduction of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics concepts.

Abstract: In its beginnings, the physics of intense laser-matter interactions was the
physics of multiphoton processes. The theory was reduced then to high-order
perturbation theory, while treating matter and light in a quantum manner. With
the advent of chirped pulse amplification developed by D. Strickland and G.
Mourou, which enabled generation of ultra-intense, ultra-short, coherent laser
pulses, the need for a quantum electrodynamics description of electromagnetic
(EM) fields practically ceased to exist and lost relevance. Contemporary
attoscience (AS), and more generally ultrafast laser physics, awarded the Nobel
Prize in 2023 to P. Agostini, F. Krausz, and A. L'Huillier, commonly uses the
classical description of EM fields while keeping a fully quantum description of
matter. The progress and successes of AS in the last 40 years have been
spectacular, with an enormous amount of fascinating investigations in basic
research and technology. Yet a central question remains: can ultrafast laser
physics continue to advance without reintroducing quantum electrodynamics and
quantum optics into its description of light-matter interactions? This article
discusses future perspectives at the intersection of strong-field physics and
quantum optics.

Abstract: We show that the Guided Local Hamiltonian problem for stoquastic Hamiltonians
is (promise) BPP-hard. The Guided Local Hamiltonian problem is a variant of the
Local Hamiltonian problem that incorporates an additional input known as a
guiding state, which is promised to overlap with the ground state. For a range
of local Hamiltonian families, this problem is (promise) BQP-hard, though for
stoquastic Hamiltonians, the complexity was previously unknown. Our results are
achieved by first reducing from quantum-inspired BPP circuits to 6-local
stoquastic Hamiltonians. We prove particular classes of quantum states, known
as semi-classical encoded subset states, can guide the estimation of the ground
state energy. Subsequent analysis shows the BPP-hardness is not dependent on
the locality, i.e., the result holds for 2-local stoquastic Hamiltonians.
Additional arguments further the BPP-hardness to Hamiltonians restricted to a
square lattice. We also find for stoquastic Hamiltonians with a fixed local
constraint on a subset of the system qubits, the Guided Local Hamiltonian
problem is BQP-hard.

Abstract: Resonance fluorescence from a single two-level system is a cornerstone of
quantum optics. In the strong driving regime, its emission spectrum exhibits
the iconic Mollow triplet, with each spectral component corresponding to a
transition between distinct atom-photon dressed states. Here, we experimentally
study the resonance fluorescence spectrum under a novel driving configuration
in which a second gigahertz-frequency field drives the Rabi transition between
two atom-photon dressed states. Our experiment is performed on a single
semiconductor quantum dot strongly driven by a laser and a surface acoustic
wave. We observe emission spectra that are significantly altered from the
standard Mollow triplet, including the dynamical cancellation of resonance
fluorescence at the central emission frequency. These spectra are explained by
a theoretical model that incorporates the hybridization of the two-level
system, the optical field, and the acoustic field. Motivated by this model, we
experimentally validate the condition for optimal cooling of acoustic phonons
in an emitter-optomechanical system. Our results offer new insights into the
quantum interactions among single two-level systems, optical fields, and
acoustic fields in the strong driving limit, with important applications in
nonclassical acoustic state generation, quantum transduction, and quantum
sensing of thermal motions.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a provably secure way of generating a
secret key, which can later be used for encoding and decoding information. In
this paper we analyze the effects of an eavesdropper's variable-strength
measurements on QKD. Two types of measurements have been considered: (i) a
probe-based model, commonly referred to as a "weak measurement", in which each
qubit is weakly coupled to a continuous variable probe which is later
projectively measured (ii) a probeless model, usually referred to as a "partial
measurement", where only a small (tunable) part of all transmitted photons is
projectively measured and the rest are transmitted with no disturbance. The
information gain of the eavesdropper and the quantum-bit-error-rate (QBER) are
computed for each case. An experimental realization of an intercept-and-resend
attack based on variable-strength partial measurements is demonstrated in a
time-bin-encoded, fiber-based simplified Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol,
which is compatible with data centers. It is shown that the measured
information gain and QBER follow the theoretical curves across the full
coupling range, validating the partial-measurement model and clarifying its
relation to the well-known monitoring channel. Further attacks involving photon
number splitting and noise injection during the calibration stage are also
analyzed. The results highlight the theoretical differences between weak and
partial measurements, while also demonstrating the practicality of probeless
eavesdropping in the case of real-world QKD systems.

TL;DR: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for precision oncology show potential to outperform classical methods despite evolving hardware limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomarker discovery in precision oncology benefits from quantum-enhanced classical algorithms, bridging quantum and classical computing advancements.

Method: Co-designed algorithms for feature selection on near-term quantum hardware, balancing algorithmic and physical device constraints.

Result: Demonstrated quantum advantage in specific tasks, suggesting Near/Intermediate-Term Quantum Computing (NITQC) potential.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches could revolutionize precision oncology and apply to other fields, highlighting the evolving landscape of quantum computing.

Abstract: We present a case study and forward-looking perspective on co-design for
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, centered on the goal of empirical quantum
advantage (EQA), which we define as a measurable performance gain using quantum
hardware over state-of-the-art classical methods on the same task. Because
classical algorithms continue to improve, the EQA crossover point is a moving
target; nevertheless, we argue that a persistent advantage is possible for our
application class even if the crossover point shifts. Specifically, our team
examines the task of biomarker discovery in precision oncology. We push the
limitations of the best classical algorithms, improving them as best as we can,
and then augment them with a quantum subroutine for the task where we are most
likely to see performance gains. We discuss the implementation of a quantum
subroutine for feature selection on current devices, where hardware constraints
necessitate further co-design between algorithm and physical device
capabilities. Looking ahead, we perform resource analysis to explore a
plausible EQA region on near/intermediate-term hardware, considering the
impacts of advances in classical and quantum computing on this regime. Finally,
we outline potential clinical impact and broader applications of this hybrid
pipeline beyond oncology.

Conclusion: 该研究为参数化量子动力学的特征图表示方法提供了理论框架和分析工具，为量子优化和模拟提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: We derive and analyze three feature map representations of parametrized
quantum dynamics, which generalize variational quantum circuits. These are (i)
a Lie-Fourier partial sum, (ii) a Taylor expansion, and (iii) a
finite-dimensional sinc kernel regression representation. The Lie-Fourier
representation is shown to have a dense spectrum with discrete peaks, that
reflects control Hamiltonian properties, but that is also compressible in
typically found symmetric systems. We prove boundedness in the spectrum and the
cost function derivatives, and discrete symmetries of the coefficients, with
implications for learning and simulation. We further show the landscape is
Lipschitz continuous, linking global variation bounds to local Taylor
approximation error - key for step size selection, convergence estimates, and
stopping criteria in optimization. This also provides a new form of polynomial
barren plateaux originating from the Lie-Fourier structure of the quantum
dynamics. These results may find application in local and general surrogate
model learning, which we benchmark numerically, in characterizations of
hardness and phase transitions in the problem instances, and for meta-parameter
heuristics in quantum optimizers.

Abstract: We investigate measures of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems governed
by Gaussian free fermionic dynamics. Standard indicators of non-Markovian
behavior, such as the BLP and LFS measures, are revisited in this context. We
show that for Gaussian states, trace-based distances -- specifically the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm -- and second-order R\'enyi mutual information can be
efficiently expressed in terms of two-point correlation functions, enabling
practical computation even in systems where the full density matrix is
intractable. Crucially, this framework remains valid even when the density
matrix of the system is an average over stochastic Gaussian trajectories,
yielding a non-Gaussian state. We present efficient numerical protocols based
on this structure and demonstrate their feasibility through a small-scale
simulation. Our approach opens a scalable path to quantifying non-Markovianity
in interacting or measured fermionic systems, with applications in quantum
information and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Recently, proposals for realizing a nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase
transition (SQPT) have been put forward, based on either nonreciprocal
interactions between two spin ensembles or the Sagnac-Fizeau shift in a
spinning cavity. However, experimental implementation of such a nonreciprocal
SQPT remains challenging. This motivates the search for new mechanisms capable
of producing a nonreciprocal SQPT. Here, we propose an alternative approach to
realize a nonreciprocal SQPT, induced by the magnon Kerr effect (MKE), in a
cavity magnonic system, where magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are
coupled to cavity photons. The Kerr coefficient $K$ is positive (negative),
i.e., $K>0$ ($K<0$), when the bias magnetic field is aligned along the
crystallographic axis [100] ([110]) of the YIG sphere. We show that the
steady-state phase diagrams differ significantly for both cases with $K > 0$
and $K < 0$, which is the origin of the nonreciprocal SQPT. By further studying
the steady-state magnon occupation and its fluctuations versus the parametric
drive strength, we demonstrate that the SQPT becomes nonreciprocal,
characterized by distinct critical thresholds for $K > 0$ and $K < 0$.
Moreover, we introduce a bidirectional contrast ratio to quantify this
nonreciprocal behavior. Our work provides a new mechanism for realizing the
nonreciprocal SQPT, with potential applications in designing nonreciprocal
quantum devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need to improve the efficiency of quantum circuit compilation in large-scale trapped-ion architectures, as shuttle operations are a major overhead in EML-QCCD systems.

Method: MUSS-TI employs a multi-level scheduling approach, inspired by classical computing multi-level memory scheduling, designed to be aware of the distinct roles of different zones in the QCCD layout to minimize shuttle operations.

Result: The paper demonstrates substantial improvements: MUSS-TI reduces shuttle operations by 41.74% for 30-32 qubits, and by 73.38% and 59.82% for 117-128 qubits and 256-299 qubits, respectively, showcasing its effectiveness in scaling.

Conclusion: MUSS-TI represents a significant advancement in optimizing trapped-ion quantum computing systems by efficiently reducing shuttle operations, thereby enhancing scalability and practicality.

Abstract: Trapped-ion computing is a leading architecture in the pursuit of scalable
and high fidelity quantum systems. Modular quantum architectures based on
photonic interconnects offer a promising path for scaling trapped ion devices.
In this design, multiple Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) units are
interconnected through entanglement module. Each unit features a multi-zone
layout that separates functionalities into distinct areas, enabling more
efficient and flexible quantum operations. However, achieving efficient and
scalable compilation of quantum circuits in such entanglement module linked
Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (EML-QCCD) remains a primary challenge for
practical quantum applications.
  In this work, we propose a scalable compiler tailored for large-scale
trapped-ion architectures, with the goal of reducing the shuttling overhead
inherent in EML-QCCD devices. MUSS-TI introduces a multi-level scheduling
approach inspired by multi-level memory scheduling in classical computing. This
method is designed to be aware of the distinct roles of different zones and to
minimize the number of shuttling operations required in EML-QCCD systems. We
demonstrate that EML-QCCD architectures are well-suited for executing
large-scale applications. Our evaluation shows that MUSS-TI reduces shuttle
operations by 41.74% for applications with 30-32 qubits, and by an average of
73.38% and 59.82% for applications with 117-128 qubits and 256-299 qubits,

TL;DR: 研究拥挤量子密钥分布（CVQKD）系统中的本地振荡器（LLO）模式，该方法通过消除本地振荡器信道、增强鲍的检测性能和减少信道泄露引起的额外噪声，从而有效提升了系统的安全性与性能。然而，由于信号与本地振荡器由不同的激光器产生，且信号通过不可信的量子信道传输，其脉宽可能产生偏差。这种偏差会直接影响鲍的检测精度与参数估计，使密钥速率计算不准确。同时，脉宽偏差可能导致潜在的安全漏洞。本文研究了LLO-CVQKD系统中局部振荡器与信号脉宽不匹配时的实际安全问题。首先，我们建立了脉宽不匹配的模型，并分析了其对鲍检测的影响。其次，通过模拟分析了密钥速率对不同偏差等级的敏感性。基于此分析表明，这种偏差会使密钥参数在计算密钥速率过程中被误估计，导致系统密钥速率过高被估计。因此，这种不完全的偏差会为爱 Dee（Eve）提供通过这一漏洞进攻实际系统的可能。为此，我们设计了在鲍端监测信号与本地振荡器脉宽，并重构本地振荡器波形以使二者再次同步的方法。该方法有效消除脉宽偏差所导致的不利影响，可以有效抵御爱 Dee通过利用此漏洞进行攻击。

Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems, using a
local local oscillator (LLO) scheme removes the local oscillator side channel,
enhances Bob's detection performance and reduces the excess noise caused by
photon leakage, thereby effectively improves the system's security and
performance. However, in this scheme, since the signal and the LO are generated
by different lasers and the signal propagates through the untrusted quantum
channel, their pulse widths may become mismatched. Such mismatches may reduce
the precision of detection at Bob, affecting parameter estimation processes and
leading to inaccurate calculations of the secret key rate. Moreover, mismatches
may introduce potential security loopholes. Thus, this paper investigates the
practical security issues of the LLO-CVQKD system when pulse width mismatch
occurs between the local oscillator and the signal. We first model the case of
pulse width mismatch and analyze its impact on Bob's detection. Then, we
simulate the secret key rate under different mismatch levels. Based on the
analysis, we find that under such mismatch, the key parameters involved in
secret key rate calculation are incorrectly estimated, leading to an
overestimation of the system's secret key rate. Therefore, this imperfect
mismatch can open a loophole for Eve to perform attacks in practical systems.
To close this loophole, we design a scheme at Bob to monitor the pulse widths
of both the signal and the local oscillator, and to reshape the waveform of the
local oscillator so that the two lights are matched again. This method
eliminates the adverse effects caused by pulse width mismatch and effectively
resists Eve's attacks which exploit this loophole.

Abstract: The ability to extend the lifetime of a logical qubit beyond that of the best
physical qubit available within the same system, i.e., the break-even point, is
a prerequisite for building practical quantum computers. So far, this point has
been exceeded through active quantum error correction (QEC) protocols, where a
logical error is corrected by measuring its syndrome and then performing an
adaptive correcting operation. Autonomous QEC (AQEC), without the need for such
resource-consuming measurement-feedback control, has been demonstrated in
several experiments, but none of which has unambiguously reached the break-even
point. Here, we present an unambiguous demonstration of beyond-break-even AQEC
in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where a photonic logical qubit
encoded in a superconducting microwave cavity is protected against photon loss
through autonomous error correction, enabled by engineered dissipation. Under
the AQEC protection, the logical qubit achieves a lifetime surpassing that of
the best physical qubit available in the system by 18\%. We further employ this
AQEC protocol to enhance the precision for measuring a slight frequency shift,
achieving a metrological gain of 6.3 dB over that using the most robust
Fock-state superposition. These results illustrate that the demonstrated AQEC
procedure not only represents a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum
computation but also offers advantages for building robust quantum sensors.

Abstract: Quantum many-body problems are central to various scientific disciplines, yet
their ground-state properties are intrinsically challenging to estimate. Recent
advances in deep learning (DL) offer potential solutions in this field,
complementing prior purely classical and quantum approaches. However, existing
DL-based models typically assume access to a large-scale and noiseless labeled
dataset collected by infinite sampling. This idealization raises fundamental
concerns about their practical utility, especially given the limited
availability of quantum hardware in the near term. To unleash the power of
these DL-based models, we propose AiDE-Q (\underline{a}utomat\underline{i}c
\underline{d}ata \underline{e}ngine for \underline{q}uantum property
estimation), an effective framework that addresses this challenge by
iteratively generating high-quality synthetic labeled datasets. Specifically,
AiDE-Q utilizes a consistency-check method to assess the quality of synthetic
labels and continuously improves the employed DL models with the identified
high-quality synthetic dataset. To verify the effectiveness of AiDE-Q, we
conduct extensive numerical simulations on a diverse set of quantum many-body
and molecular systems, with up to 50 qubits. The results show that AiDE-Q
enhances prediction performance for various reference learning models, with
improvements of up to $14.2\%$. Moreover, we exhibit that a basic supervised
learning model integrated with AiDE-Q outperforms advanced reference models,
highlighting the importance of a synthetic dataset. Our work paves the way for
more efficient and practical applications of DL for quantum property
estimation.

Abstract: The Kitaev chain has been extensively explored in the context of uniform
couplings, with studies focusing either on purely nearest-neighbor interactions
or on systems dominated by long-range superconducting pairing. Building on
these investigations, we introduce a hybrid Kitaev chain in which the lattice
is partitioned into two segments: the left segment comprises nearest-neighbor
couplings, while the right segment incorporates long-range pairing. To probe
the role of the interface, we study two scenarios: a decoupled (suppressed
hopping) case, where the segments are isolated, and a coupled case, where they
are connected via interface hopping that enables coherent tunneling. Using this
setup, we investigate the behavior of Majorana zero modes at the interface
between the two segments, finding that in the decoupled case, Majorana zero
modes remain sharply localized at the left segment chain edges while massive
Dirac modes remain in right segment chain edges, with their energies and
localization strongly dependent on the long-range pairing exponent. Introducing
a finite interface coupling enables coherent transfer of Majorana zero modes
from the edges of the left segment to those of the right segment of the chain.
We characterize this dynamics by the fidelity of state transfer, dynamical
rotation, and inverse participation ratio. We show the signature of MZM
transfer across the interface by the spatiotemporal profile of the probability
distribution of the time evolved state.

Abstract: We investigate the open problem of the existence of genuinely unextendible
product bases (GUPBs), that is, multipartite unextendible product bases (UPBs)
which remain unextendible even with respect to biproduct vectors across all
bipartitions of the parties. To this end, we exploit the well-known connection
between UPBs and graph theory through orthogonality graphs and orthogonal
representations, together with recent progress in this framework, and employ
forbidden induced subgraph characterizations to single out the admissible local
orthogonality graphs for GUPBs. Using this approach, we establish that GUPBs of
size thirteen in three-qutrit systems-the smallest candidate GUPBs-do not
exist. We further provide a partial characterization of graphs relevant to
larger bases and systems with ququart subsystems.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), a quintessential NP-hard

but limited by exponential complexity in large instances. We propose a hybrid
quantum-classical framework integrating variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
optimisation with classical machine learning, using K-means clustering for

Evaluated on 80 European cities (from 4 to 80 cities, 38,500 samples in total)
via Qiskit's AerSimulator and ibm_kyiv 127-qubit backend, the hybrid approach
outperforms quantum-only methods, achieving an approximation ratio of 1.0287 at
80 cities, a 47.5% improvement over quantum-only's 1.9614, nearing the

(interquartile range, IQR - the spread of the middle 50% of results relative to
the median - from 0.06 to 0.04), enhancing stability despite noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) noise. This framework underscores hybrid

Abstract: We study the problem of optimally generating quantum gates in a logical
subspace embedded in a larger Hilbert space, where the dynamics is also
affected by unknown static imperfections. This general problem is widespread
across various emergent quantum technology architectures. We derive the
fidelity susceptibility in the computational subspace as a measure of
robustness to perturbations, and define a cost function that quantifies leakage
out of the subspace. We tackle both effects using a two-stage optimization
where two cost functions are minimized in series. Specifically, we apply this
framework to the generation of single-qubit gates in a superconducting transmon
system, and find high-fidelity solutions robust to detuning and amplitude
errors across various parameter regimes. We also show control pulses which
maximize fidelity while minimizing leakage at all times during the evolution.
However, finding control solutions that address both effects simultaneously is
shown to be much more challenging, indicating the presence of a trade-off
relation.

Abstract: Bell nonlocality exemplifies the most profound departure of quantum theory
from classical realism. Yet, the extent of nonlocality in quantum theory is
intrinsically bounded, falling short of the correlations permitted by the
relativistic causality (the no-signaling) principle. A paradigmatic example is
the Popescu-Rohrlich correlation: two distant parties sharing arbitrary
entanglement cannot achieve this correlation, though it can be simulated with
classical communication between them. Here we show how such post-quantum
correlations can instead be simulated using intrinsically non-signaling
physical resources, and implement the proposed scheme using a quantum circuit
on a four-qubit photonic platform. Unlike the conventional approaches, our
method exploits dynamical correlations between distinct physical systems, with
intrinsic randomness suppressing any signaling capacity. This enables the
realization of post-quantum correlations both with and without entanglement. We
also analyze how the simulation scheme extends to beyond quantum nonlocal
correlations in multipartite systems. Our experimental demonstration using a
photonic system establishes a versatile framework for exploring post-quantum
correlations in both foundational settings and as a resource for computation
and security applications.

Abstract: Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum
communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single
photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon
events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum
communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered
photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for
real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD
readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based
high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full
waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time;
2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position
metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each
detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy
achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs
~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world
case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission
system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2
times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks
a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.

*Xiao Huang,Guanhua Chen,Yao Yao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文研究了量子电路中的非局部魔法资源与矩阵乘法态的态维数之间的标度规律。研究发现，非局部魔法资源收敛于一个与系统尺寸呈对数关系的态维数，而纠缠度则呈指数关系增长。这种差异表明，尽管纠缠度对于模拟量子电路在经典计算机上有限制，但非局部魔法资源作为一种特性标记，可以增强模拟能力。此外，通过内在的标度特性实现了对非局部魔法资源与额外纠缠度之间的信息分离，表明纠缠度不能单独解释非局部魔法资源的增长和传播。

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，如何高效模拟量子电路成为重要的研究方向。本论文为解决这一问题提供了新的视角，通过研究非局部魔法资源与纠缠度的关系，揭示了有用资源与纠缠度的区别，为优化资源利用提供了理论依据。

Method: 该论文采用的是Haar-随机量子电路的蒙特卡洛采样方法，结合矩阵乘法态的方法对系统进行了数值模拟和分析。

Result: 通过数值模拟，论文得到了两个主要结果：(1)非局部魔法资源的收敛态维数与系统尺寸呈对数关系；(2)纠缠度的收敛态维数与系统尺寸呈指数关系。这两个结果清晰地展示了资源与纠缠度在系统演化中的标度特性及其物理含义。

Conclusion: 在量子电路的模拟中，纠缠度作为主要衡量标准有其局限性，而非局部魔法资源作为一种独特的特性资源具有更强的模拟能力。其标度特性为数据库优化和资源利用提供了一个新的视角和方向。

Abstract: In design and simulation of quantum circuits with multiple units, the
computational ability is greatly limited by quickly increasing entanglement,
and the ordinary sampling methods normally exhibit low efficiency. Herein, we
uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the nonlocal magic resource and the bond
dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is,
the nonlocal magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic
scale with the system size. It means, in the practical simulations of quantum
circuits, merely small bond dimension suffices to bear with the dynamics of
stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy with rank $n=1,2$. On the other hand, the
entanglement converges on a bond dimension exponentially scaled in the system
size. This remarkable difference reveals that, while the simulation of
entanglement on a classical computer is limited, the utilization of nonlocal
magic resource as a characterization could make the simulation power much
stronger. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation
between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement, achieving an
indication that it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving
force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.

Abstract: Advancing large-scale quantum computing requires superconducting circuits

integrated with Si/SiGe quantum wells, creating a hybrid platform designed for

TL;DR: 研究通过测量设计中的反对比读out方法，探讨了这种策略在量子力学中的极限。通过自同化（self-fidelity）作为投影态空间中的随机变量，并采用皮尔逊相关系数作为设备agnostic的全局对立度量，建立了定理：对于任何非平凡的两个量子操作，自同化不能在态空间的每个点上成为点态互补的相关性。这意味着，存在一个基于量子几何的下限，即反对比度的数学下限无法超越，这一结论对所有硬件和噪声模型都适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者在量子测量设计中，试图通过反对比度读out的方式来抑制共同模式贡献，评估这种策略在量子力学中的潜力。研究的目标是确定反对比度在量子 Unitary 感应协议中的理论极限。

Method: 研究者通过自同化（自反馈，self-fidelity）作为随机变量，在投影态空间上进行建模，并使用皮尔逊相关系数来衡量两个量子操作之间的全局对立。研究使用了定理证明：对于任何非平凡的两个量子操作，自同化不能在态空间的每个点上成为点态互补的相关性。

Result: 研究得出结论：在量子态空间中，自同化不能在所有点上实现完全反态的相关性，这意味着存在一个基于量子几何的下限，即反对比度的数学下限无法超越。具体包括在单一 qubit 的布洛赫球（Bloch-sphere）Ramsey 模型中，即使在理论上最佳调谐条件下，仍存在剩余的共同模式成分；在高维情况下，通过 Haar 策划或其他设计矩恒等式简化了集合均值和协方差，得出了与实现细节无关的相同结论。

Conclusion: 这项研究为量子传感器协议中的反对比度提供了模型独立的理论准则，表明了反对比度在量子力学中的理论极限。研究结论表明，反对比度的下限是由量子几何决定的，与具体硬件和噪声模型无关，因此在所有情况中都有一个内在的限制，旨在提高量子测量设计的信任度和可扩展性。

Abstract: In measurement design, it is common to engineer anti-contrast readouts -- two
measurements that respond as differently as possible to the same inputs so that
common-mode contributions are suppressed. To assess the fundamental scope of
this strategy in unitary dynamics, we ask whether two evolutions can be made
uniformly opposite over a broad input ensemble, or whether quantum mechanics
imposes a structural limit on such opposition. We address this by treating
self-fidelity (survival probability) as a random variable on projective state
space and adopting the Pearson correlation coefficient as a device-agnostic
measure of global opposition between two evolutions. Within this framework we
establish the following theorem: For any nontrivial pair of unitaries,
self-fidelity maps cannot be point-wise complementary correlation on the entire
state space. Consequently, the mathematical lower edge of the correlation bound
is not physically attainable, which we interpret as a unitary-geometric floor
on anti-contrast, independent of hardware specifics and noise models. We make
this floor explicit in realizable settings. In a single-qubit Bloch-sphere
Ramsey model, a closed-form relation shows that a residual common-mode
component persists even under nominally optimal tuning. In higher dimensions,
Haar/design moment identities reduce ensemble means and covariances of
self-fidelity to a small set of unitary invariants, yielding the same
conclusion irrespective of implementation details. Taken together, these
results provide a model-independent criterion for what anti-contrast can and
cannot achieve in unitary sensing protocols.

*Guangyi Li,Yu Gan,Zeguan Wu,Xueyue Zhang,Zheshen Zhang,Junyu Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A novel domain-specific architecture called Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM) is introduced to alleviate the heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates in quantum random access memories (QRAMs). The architecture is designed specifically for data with an affine Boolean structure and achieves optimal logical circuit depth and space complexity using only Clifford gates. This results in a zero T-count, effectively eliminating the non-Clifford gate bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for data-intensive quantum algorithms has led to the development of QRAMs. However, the reliance on non-Clifford gates poses a significant challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a specialized architecture for data with affine Boolean structures, offering a solution that minimizes the use of expensive non-Clifford gates.

Method: The authors demonstrate that the gate interactions for implementing matrix A form a bipartite graph. By applying König's edge-coloring theorem, they derive optimal logical circuit depth and space complexity for Stab-QRAM. The architecture exclusively uses Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero T-count.

Result: Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth and space complexity of O(log N) for N data items. By avoiding non-Clifford gates, it completely circumvents the associated costs, making it highly suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. The paper highlights its applications in discrete dynamical systems and Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms.

Conclusion: Stab-QRAM represents a significant advancement in QRAM design by addressing the non-Clifford gate bottleneck. Through its efficient use of Clifford gates, it provides a practical solution for implementing data-intensive quantum algorithms on emerging quantum hardware.

Abstract: Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum
algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are
hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates
(e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement
fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM
(Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine
Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over
$\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series
analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate
interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By
applying K\"{o}nig's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that
Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data
items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is
constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero
$T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck,
eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it
exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We
highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications
in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear
Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive
tasks on emerging quantum hardware.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect, showing that the AB phase difference can be expressed in terms of electric and magnetic fluxes. The authors explore how the AB effect behaves in different inertial reference frames, concluding that it is fundamentally an electromagnetic phenomenon without inherent magnetic or electric components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The AB effect is a fundamental quantum phenomenon, and understanding its dependence on electric and magnetic fluxes across reference frames is crucial for unifying electromagnetic theory.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis and mathematical derivations to explore the AB effect in various reference frames, emphasizing a topological approach.

Result: The paper finds that the AB phase difference arises from electromagnetic fluxes, making the traditional electric or magnetic labels redundant.

Conclusion: The AB effect is inherently electromagnetic, not purely electric or magnetic, across all reference frames.

Abstract: Recent works showed that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase difference for a
quantum charged particle can be written in terms of electric and magnetic
fluxes in a spacetime surface whose boundaries are the possible particle
worldlines in the interferometer, relative to the possible paths. After
presenting this result in a more detailed way, reinforcing its topological
nature, we study the magnetic and electric versions of the AB effect in
different inertial reference frames. We find a particular reference frame for a
magnetic AB effect where the magnetic flux has a null contribution for the AB
phase difference, which is entirely due to an electric flux. Also, we find a
particular reference frame for an electric AB effect where the electric flux
has a null contribution for the AB phase difference, which is entirely due to a
magnetic flux. In this sense, the nomenclatures 'magnetic AB effect' and
'electric AB effect' lose their meaning. We have electromagnetic AB effects.

transforms as main building blocks. In particular, for the unitary group, our
method is efficient in space and time. Finally, our general oracle for forward
queries can be easily modified into oracles for conjugate, transpose, and
inverse queries, thus unifying all four query types.
