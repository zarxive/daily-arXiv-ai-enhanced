Abstract: VOXES is a Von Hamos X-ray spectrometer developed at the INFN National Laboratories of Frascati for high-resolution laboratory X-ray spectroscopy in the 5--20~keV range. It uses curved mosaic crystals and motorized positioning stages to perform wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) with sub-10~eV tunable resolution for extended and dilute samples. Recent developments include the integration of an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) line based on a silicon pin-diode detector, which enables flux monitoring and simultaneous ED and WD measurements. In addition, a dedicated liquid-sample holder has been introduced, and a Y-shaped support geometry, crucial for switching to a transmission layout, provides mechanical compatibility with laboratory XAS, now under implementation. These upgrades expand the versatility and automation of VOXES, strengthening its role as a table-top platform for laboratory X-ray spectroscopy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the design and numerical simulation of a spiking neuron capable of on-chip machine learning. Built within the CMOS+X framework, the spiking neuron consists of an NMOS transistor combined with a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This NMOS+MTJ unit, when simulated in the industry-standard circuit simulation software LTspice, reproduces multiple functions of a biological neuron, including threshold spiking, latency, refractory periods, synaptic integration, inhibition, and adaptation. These behaviors arise from the intrinsic magnetization dynamics of the MTJ and do not require any additional control circuitry. By interconnecting the NMOS+MTJ neurons, we construct a model of an analog multilayer network that learns through spike-timing-dependent weight updates derived from a gradient-descent rule, with both training and inference modeled in the analog domain. The simulated CMOS+X network achieves reliable spike propagation and successful training on a nonlinear task, indicating a feasible path toward compact, low-power, in-memory neuromorphic hardware for edge applications.

Abstract: In this work, we report on the design and fabrication of p-NiO/Ga2O3 trench junction barrier schottky diodes (JBSD) integrated with space-modulated junction termination extension (SM-JTE) and compare the performance with planar Ni/Ga2O3 schottky diodes (SBDs) and p-NiO/Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs). The JBSDs achieved breakdown voltages exceeding 1.8 kV along with low leakage currents (<10-2 A/cm2), while displaying low turn on voltage (VON) of ~1V, which is similar to that of planar Ni/Ga2O3 SBDs. The fabricated devices showed excellent forward characteristics with low differential on-resistance (Ron,sp) ranging from 4-10.5 mΩ-cm2, for fin width between 0.6- 1.25 microns. Best performing device with fin width of 0.85μm showed a unipolar figure of merit (FOM) of ~0.7GW/cm2. This work showcases the benefits of trench JBS design along with SM-JTE edge-termination for efficient high-performance kilovolt-class \b{eta}- Ga2O3 diodes.

Abstract: In this article, a new formula for computing Cayley's first hyperdeterminant in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol is given. It is then shown that this formula can be used to compute the hyperdeterminant of symmetric hypermatrices in polynomial time with respect to their order (assuming fixed side length).

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QGShap是一种基于量子计算的Shapley值方法，用于提高图神经网络的解释性。该方法通过 amplitude amplification 在 coalition 评估中达到平方级速度提升，同时保持精确的 Shapley 计算。实验结果表明，QGShap 在 fidelity 和解释准确性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图神经网络在多个领域中的广泛应用，如药物发现和社会网络分析，透明性和可解释性成为 key challenge。现有的 Shapley 基础方法虽然有数学上的优势，但计算成本过高，限制了其实际应用。寻求一种既能保持 fidelity 又能提高效率的方法成为研究焦点。

Method: 该研究提出了一种基于量子计算的 Shapley 值方法，称为 QGShap。该方法利用 amplitude amplification 技术加速 coalition 的评估过程，从而实现了二次速度提升。与传统的经典方法不同，QGShap 通过保持精确的 Shapley 计算，避免了 approximation 和 trade-offs，确保了解释的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，QGShap 在 fidelity 和解释准确性方面得到了显著提升。在所有评估指标中，QGShap 的性能均不低于经典方法。这表明 QGShap 既保持了 Shapley 值的精确性，又提升了解释性。

Conclusion: QGShap 为图神经网络的解释性研究提供了一种创新的解决方案。通过结合量子计算和 Shapley 值方法，QGShap 在保持数学严谨性的同时，显著提升了计算效率。我们建议研究人员和从业者在实际应用中尝试 QGShap，以提高模型的透明性和可靠性。过于受限的实现可能削弱其实际应用的价值。未来的研究方向值得探索如何进一步优化计算效率和扩展方法的适用范围。对于实践者来说，QGShap 的实现可能仍面临实现细节等挑战。我们得出结论：当前阶段，虽然 QGShap 成为了一个强大的工具，但其在大规模图中的应用仍需continue exploration。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become indispensable in critical domains such as drug discovery, social network analysis, and recommendation systems, yet their black-box nature hinders deployment in scenarios requiring transparency and accountability. While Shapley value-based methods offer mathematically principled explanations by quantifying each component's contribution to predictions, computing exact values requires evaluating $2^n$ coalitions (or aggregating over $n!$ permutations), which is intractable for real-world graphs. Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility. We introduce QGShap, a quantum computing approach that leverages amplitude amplification to achieve quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation while maintaining exact Shapley computation. Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs. The implementation of QGShap is available at https://github.com/smlab-niser/qgshap.

### [7] [Generating redundantly encoded resource states for photonic quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03131)
*Samuel J. Sheldon,Pieter Kok*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Researchers propose a method to deterministically generate redundantly encoded photonic resource states for measurement-based quantum computing, reducing errors and loss dependence using single quantum emitters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies on complex entangled states, and probabilistic methods can be inefficient. This work aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of generating photonic cluster states.

Method: The method involves using single quantum emitters to redundantly encode graph states with GHZ states, achieving deterministic generation with improved success rates.

Result: The protocol reduces error rates and makes fusion more reliable by accounting for loss, enhancing resource state quality for quantum computing.

Conclusion: This advances photonic quantum computing by providing a robust method to generate essential resource states with high efficiency.

Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computing relies on the generation of large entangled cluster states that act as a universal resource on which logical circuits can be imprinted and executed through local measurements. A number of strategies for constructing sufficiently large photonic cluster states propose fusing many smaller resource states generated by a series of quantum emitters. However, the fusion process is inherently probabilistic with a 50% success probability in standard guise. A recent proposal has shown that, in the limit of low loss, the probability of achieving successful fusion may be boosted to near unity by redundantly encoding the vertices of linear graph states using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states [Quantum 7, 992 (2023)]. Here we present a protocol for deterministically generating redundantly encoded photonic resource states using single quantum emitters, and study the impact of protocol errors and photonic losses on the generated resource states and type-II photonic fusion. Our work provides a route for efficiently constructing complex entangled photonic qubit states for photonic quantum computing and quantum repeaters.

Abstract: The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers to large sizes requires the implementation of many parallel qubit readouts. Here we present an ultrastable superconducting-qubit readout method using the multi-tone self-phase-referenced Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique, originally developed for use with optical cavities. In this work, we benchmark PDH readout of a single transmon qubit, using room-temperature heterodyne detection of all tones to reconstruct the PDH signal. We demonstrate that PDH qubit readout is insensitive to microwave phase drift, displaying $0.73^\circ$ phase stability over 2 hours, and capable of single-shot readout in the presence of phase errors exceeding the phase shift induced by the qubit state. We show that the PDH sideband tones do not cause unwanted measurement-induced state transitions for a transmon qubit, leading to a potential signal enhancement of at least $14$~dB over traditional heterodyne readout.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum annealers are emerging as programmable, dynamical experimental platforms for probing strongly correlated spin systems. Yet key thermal assumptions, chiefly a Gibbs-distributed output ensemble, remain unverified in the large-scale regime. Here, we experimentally and quantitatively assess Gibbs sampling fidelity across system sizes spanning over three orders of magnitude. We explore a wide parameter space of coupling strengths, system sizes, annealing times, and D-wave hardware architectures. We find that the naively assumed scaling law for the effective temperature requires a non-negligible, coupling-independent offset that is robust across machines and parameter regimes, quantifying residual non-thermal effects that still conform to an effective Gibbs description. These non-idealities are further reflected in a systematic discrepancy between the physical temperature inferred from the sampled ensemble and the nominal cryogenic temperature of the device. Our results systematically assess the viability of quantum annealers as experimental platforms for probing classical thermodynamics, correct previous assumptions, and provide a physically grounded thermometry framework to benchmark these machines for future thermodynamic experiments.

Abstract: Edge bit in an average symmetry protected topological (ASPT) mixed state is studied. The state is protected by one strong $Z_2$ and one weak (average) $Z_2$ symmetries. As analogous objects of pure symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, the ASPT possesses edge bits. In particular, the analogous operator response exists, that is, symmetry fractionalization. The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the quantum resource requirements of a dataset generated from simulations of two-dimensional, periodic, incompressible shear flow, aimed at training machine learning models. By measuring entanglement and non-stabilizerness on MPS-encoded functions, we estimate the computational complexity encountered by a stabilizer or a tensor network solver applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations across different flow regimes. Our analysis reveals that, under specific initial conditions, the shear width identifies a transition between resource-efficient and resource-intensive regimes for non-trivial evolution. Furthermore, we find that the two resources qualitatively track each other in time, and that the mesh resolution along with the sign structure play a crucial role in determining the resource content of the encoded state. These findings offer useful guidelines for the development of scalable, quantum-inspired approaches to fluid dynamics.

### [13] [In Situ Quantum Analog Pulse Characterization via Structured Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03193)
*Yulong Dong,Christopher Kang,Murphy Yuezhen Niu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We examine the use of in situ learning for pulse reconstruction in analog quantum simulators, addressing the challenge of requiring high-fidelity pulse control. The challenge is significant because existing methods are tailored for digital gate characterization but not for learning continuous pulse trajectories. Our solution is an algorithm that extends Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) to directly learn smooth pulse trajectories from queries of the time-ordered propagator. This method avoids the inefficiencies caused by conventional Trotterization-based methods, particularly with increased scaling issues. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we conclude that our approach provides high accuracy, strong efficiency, and robustness against common errors such as SPAM and depolarizing errors, making it a superior tool for validating analog quantum simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing is advancing, and analog quantum simulators are crucial for exploring physical phenomena like phase transitions and non-equilibrium processes. However, controlling high-fidelity pulses in these simulators remains a challenge, as traditional methods are inadequate for this purpose. This gap leads us to explore alternative methods for accurate pulse control and simulation.

Method: Our method involves extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to enable in situ learning of pulse trajectories. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, we reconstruct smooth pulse trajectories directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator. This approach avoids the inefficiencies of conventional Trotterization-based methods and mitigates scaling issues.

Result: Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, our method demonstrates high accuracy, strong efficiency, and robustness against common errors such as SPAM and depolarizing errors. Our findings indicate that this approach is highly effective for validating analog quantum simulators and detecting hardware faults.

Conclusion: We have successfully developed an algorithm that successfully addresses the challenge of learning high-fidelity pulse trajectories in analog quantum simulators. By extending the Quantum Signal Processing framework, we have devised a method that is more efficient and robust than previous approaches, offering a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators can directly emulate time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics, enabling the exploration of diverse physical phenomena such as phase transitions, quench dynamics, and non-equilibrium processes. Realizing accurate analog simulations requires high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control, yet existing calibration schemes are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot be readily extended to learn continuous pulse trajectories. We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults.

Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.

### [15] [Excess work in counterdiabatic driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03274)
*Lucas P. Kamizaki,Marcus V. S. Bonança*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: papers show that counterdiabatic driving, while adiabatic internally, requires energy expenditure in the form of excess work, which can be quantified and used to optimize the driving protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understanding the energy cost of quantum driving protocols is essential for optimizing them and minimizing energy consumption.The counterdiabatic method, which achieves adiabatic dynamics without dissipation, raises questions about its energetics and practicality.

Method: the paper draws on the mandelstam-tamm bound to relate the adiabaticity of counterdiabatic driving to the spreading of energy between eigenstates during the process.the authors propose a new interpretation of the counterdiabatic hamiltonian parameters to capture the energy cost, which traditional methods miss.

Result: by introducing this new approach, they successfully quantify the excess work as the driving protocol's energy cost and apply it to the landau-zener model, demonstrating practical application and effectiveness.

Conclusion: the paper bridges a gap in understanding the energetics of counterdiabatic driving and opens new possibilities for optimizing such protocols by accounting for the energy cost.

Abstract: Many years have passed since the conception of the quintessential method of shortcut to adiabaticity known as counterdiabatic driving (or transitionless quantum driving). Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.

Abstract: We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order Rényi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier using capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators from NbTiN and NbN films shows unprecedented amplification performance, exceeding state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers in gain, gain bandwidth, and compression power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation comes from the need for improved quantum measurement, specifically overcoming challenges like magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and stringent low-temperature requirements in superconducting qubits. Alternative platforms, such as parametric amplifiers, are sought to enhance performance and scalability.

Method: The researchers utilized a coupled-mode theoretical model to analyze the pump-induced mode modifications and a hybridized modes framework, combining these with published device measurements to design and fabricate the Kerr-nonlinear resonators.

Result: The NbN-based device exhibits superior performance with a larger Kerr coefficient, narrower gain bandwidth, and effectively cancels third-order intercept point issues, achieving exceptionally high compression powers for single-sideband amplification.

Conclusion: The success of this parametric amplifier represents a significant leap in quantum-limited amplification, providing a more robust and scalable option for advanced quantum technologies compared to existing Josephson devices.

Abstract: Parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies.

Abstract: Non-trivial dispersion relations engineered in photonic waveguide for the precise control of atomic dynamics has recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we study a system in which atoms are coupled to one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguides with long-range hoppings. By carefully engineering the jth-order nearest neighbor (JNN) hoppings between resonators, we construct linear dispersion relations with the chiral characteristic. To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings. Our study thus provides a unified framework for simulating atom-environment couplings with arbitrary dispersion relations.

Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.

Conclusion: 这项研究为量子态制备提供了一种新的方法，尤其是在强耦合 regime 下。这为量子计算和量子信息理论的发展提供了重要的理论基础和实验参考。

Abstract: We establish new theoretical results demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of system bath interaction models for quantum thermal and ground state preparation. Unlike existing analyses, which relies on the weak coupling Lindblad limit and require $O(ε)$ coupling strengths for $ε$ accuracy, leading to slow mixing, we rigorously show that accurate state preparation remains possible far beyond this regime. In particular, even when the cumulative coupling strength remains constant rather than vanishing, the induced quantum channel still approximately fixes the target state. Our proof introduces new techniques for controlling all orders of the Dyson expansion and for analyzing the associated multidimensional operator Fourier transforms. These bounds substantially improve upon prior results, and numerical simulations on the TFIM and Hubbard models further confirm the robustness of the system bath interaction framework across both weak and strong coupling regimes.

TL;DR: Si/SiO2 (SiMOS) systems face challenges in achieving high-fidelity electron shuttling compared to Si/SiGe systems, but simulations reveal possible ways to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electron shuttling in SiMOS devices is vital due to their potential for advanced electronic applications, especially in semiconductor devices.

Method: 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device were conducted, building on prior 2D models.

Result: Simulations show that oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects can collapse electron shuttling to bucket-brigade mode, but increasing confinement restores conveyor-belt operation and improves reliability.

Conclusion: SiMOS devices can achieve reliable charge transport under specific conditions, though challenges like oxide roughness and defects pose significant hurdles.

Abstract: Extensive theoretical and experimental work has established high-fidelity electron shuttling in Si/SiGe systems, whereas demonstrations in Si/SiO2 (SiMOS) remain at an early stage. To help address this, we perform full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device, building on earlier 2D modelling. We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures.

Abstract: We develop a complex-entropy framework for Wigner negativity and apply it to avoided crossings in an oval quantum billiard. For a real Wigner function the Gibbs--Shannon functional becomes complex; its imaginary part, proportional to the Wigner-negative volume, serves as an entropy-like measure of phase-space nonclassicality. A sign-resolved decomposition separates the total negative weight from its phase-space distribution and defines a negative-channel Fisher information that quantifies how sensitively the negative lobe reshapes as a control parameter is varied. This structure yields a Cauchy--Schwarz bound that limits how rapidly the imaginary entropy, and hence the Wigner negativity, can change with the parameter. In the oval billiard, avoided crossings display enhanced negativity and an amplified negative-channel Fisher response, providing a clear phase-space signature of mode hybridization. The construction is generic and extends to other wave-chaotic and mesoscopic systems with phase-space representations.

*Mohana Priya Thinesh Kumar,Pranavishvar Hariprakash*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Introduce Quantum Graph Hash (QGH-256), a new quantum hashing algorithm that produces 256-bit fingerprints by mapping messages to weighted graphs via quantum phase estimation, enhancing sensitivity and robustness against input perturbations for post-quantum applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum cryptography is evolving rapidly, and robust hashing algorithms are essential to ensure data security under quantum computing threats. This paper presents QGH-256 to address these needs, offering a novel approach for post-quantum hashing.

Method: QGH-256 operates by mapping messages to graphs using weighted edges determined by discrete random walks on a toroidal grid. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) extracts the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian's eigencomponents in a superposition state, ensuring all eigenvalues contribute. The resulting fingerprint is a 256-bit digest.

Result: QGH-256 demonstrates effectiveness and security through implementation on a 4x4 grid, showing acceptable performance despite the trade-off between collision probability and execution time. The fingerprint captures both spectral and dynamical properties, resulting in high sensitivity to input changes.

Conclusion: QGH-256 provides a promising quantum hashing method with strong collision resistance and differentiation capability between non-isomorphic graphs, making it a valuable tool for post-quantum cryptographic systems.

Abstract: We present Quantum Graph Hash (QGH-256), a novel quantum spectral hashing algorithm that generates high-entropy fingerprints from message-induced graphs. Each input message is mapped to a weighted graph via a discrete random walk on an n X n toroidal grid, where the walk dynamics determine the edge weights. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is then used to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Unlike standard QPE settings, the phase estimation is performed with respect to a superposition state (a uniform superposition over all node basis states) rather than an eigenvector, ensuring that all eigencomponents contribute to the resulting spectrum. This yields spectral features that distinguish even co-spectral but non-isomorphic message-induced graphs. The final spectral fingerprint is converted into a 256-bit digest, producing a compact representation of the input. As the fingerprint encodes both spectral and dynamical properties of the message-induced graph, the resulting hash exhibits strong sensitivity to input perturbations and provides a structurally rich foundation for post-quantum hashing. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we implement QGH-256 on a 4 X 4 toroidal grid, chosen empirically: smaller grids exhibit collisions, whereas larger grids significantly increase execution time. The entire pipeline is implemented in Qiskit, and we use a seeded statevector simulator to obtain stable, noise-free results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current experiments of GKP codes face limitations in squeezing, which restricts their performance. This paper introduces ES-ZNE as a solution to improve the code's effectiveness without increasing squeezing requirements.

Method: ES-ZNE involves measuring logical observables at various finite energies and extrapolating results to an ideal, infinite-energy state. It uses simulation of a GKP qubit under a pure-loss channel to demonstrate its efficacy.

Result: Simulations show ES-ZNE successfully mitigates finite-energy errors, achieving ideal expectation values and revealing a clear error threshold beyond which the code's benefits diminish.

Conclusion: ES-ZNE provides a practical method for improving near-term bosonic quantum processors' performance by trading off sampling resources for physical squeezing resources.

Abstract: The performance of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, an approach to hardware-efficient quantum error correction, is limited by the finite squeezing capabilities of current experimental platforms. To circumvent this hardware demand, we introduce Energy-Scaled Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ES-ZNE), a quantum error mitigation protocol that uses the mean photon number of the GKP code as a tunable effective noise parameter. The protocol measures logical observables at a series of accessible finite energies and extrapolates the results to the ideal, infinite-energy limit using an ansatz based on the code's asymptotic error scaling. Through simulating a GKP qubit under a pure-loss channel, we demonstrate that ES-ZNE successfully mitigates finite-energy errors, recovering the ideal expectation values (within numerical uncertainty) in the shallow-noise regime. Furthermore, by computationally removing artifacts arising from the finite-energy encoding, our method characterizes the intrinsic performance of the ideal GKP code, revealing a sharp error threshold beyond which the code's corrective power diminishes. These results establish ES-ZNE as a practical, software-based strategy for enhancing the performance of near-term bosonic quantum processors, trading sampling overhead for demanding physical resources like high squeezing.

Abstract: Quantum communication protocols seek to leverage the unique properties of quantum systems for coordination or communication tasks, usually with guarantees of security or anonymity that exceed what is possible classically. One promising domain of application is elections, where strong such guarantees are essential to ensure legitimacy. We experimentally implement a recently proposed election protocol from Centrone et al. such that no one, including a potential central authority, can know the preferred candidate of any voter other than themself. We conduct a four-party election, generating and distributing four-partite GHZ states with $\approx 89\%$ fidelity and successfully recording voters' intentions $\approx 87\%$ of the time.

Abstract: Continuous time quantum walks on exponentially large, sparse graphs form a powerful paradigm for quantum computing: On the one hand, they can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. On the other hand, they are themselves BQP-complete, providing an alternative framework for thinking about quantum computing -- a perspective which has indeed led to a number of novel algorithms and oracle problems. Recently, simulating the dynamics of a system of harmonic oscillators (that is, masses and springs) was set forth as another BQP-complete problem defined on exponentially large, sparse graphs. In this work, we establish a direct and transparent mapping between these two classes of problems. As compared to linking the two classes of problems via their BQP-completeness, our mapping has several desirable features: It is transparent, in that it respects the structure of the problem, including the geometry of the underlying graph, initialization, read-out, and efficient oracle access, resulting in low overhead in terms of both space and time; it allows to map also between restricted subsets of instances of both problems which are not BQP-complete; it provides a recipe to directly translate any quantum algorithm designed in the quantum walk paradigm to harmonic oscillators (and vice versa); and finally, it provides an alternative, transparent way to prove BQP-completeness of the harmonic oscillator problem by mapping it to BQP-completeness construction for the quantum walk problem (or vice versa).

Result: The method reduces the circuit depth required for implementing global gates, offering a promising approach for optimizing quantum circuit compilation in distributed quantum computing environments.

Conclusion: This research suggests significant implications for future work in quantum circuit compilation and the design of quantum data centers, particularly in enhancing the efficiency of distributed quantum computations utilizing global gates.

Abstract: Much recent work on distributed quantum computing have focused on the use of entangled pairs and distributed two qubit gates. But there has also been work on efficient schemes for achieving multipartite entanglement between nodes in a single shot, removing the need to generate multipartite entangled states using many entangled pairs. This paper looks at how multipartite entanglement resources (e.g., GHZ states) can be useful for distributed fan-out operations; we also consider the use of qudits of dimension four for distributed quantum circuit compression. In particular, we consider how such fan-out operations and qudits can be used to implement circuits which are challenging for distributed quantum computation, involving pairwise qubit interactions, i.e., what has been called global gates (a.k.a. global Mølmer-Sørensen gates). Such gates have been explored to possibly yield more efficient computations via reduced circuit depth, and can be carried out efficiently in some types of quantum hardware (e.g., trapped-ion quantum computers); we consider this as an exploration of an ``extreme'' case for distribution given the global qubit-qubit interactions. We also conclude with some implications for future work on quantum circuit compilation and quantum data centre design.

Method: The authors propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme by utilizing nonreciprocal coupling. The method involves one nanoparticle being cooled directly by an optical cavity, while the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. They then use analytical solutions and numerical simulations to validate their approach.

Abstract: Optomechanical cooling of levitated nanoparticles has become an essential topic in modern quantum physics, providing a platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena and high-precision sensing. However, conventional cavity-assisted cooling is fundamentally constrained by cavity dissipation and environmental noise, limiting the attainable minimum temperature. In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme through nonreciprocal coupling between two levitated nanoparticles, where one particle is directly cooled by an optical cavity and the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling. This study demonstrates a new cooling mechanism driven by non-Hermitian interactions, offering theoretical guidance for realizing controllable energy flow and deep cooling in levitated optomechanical systems, and paving the way for future developments in quantum control and sensing technologies.

Abstract: Quantifiers of stationarity, classicality, purity and vorticity are derived from phase-space differential geometrical structures within the Weyl-Wigner framework, after which they are related to the hyperbolic stability of classical and quantum-modified Hamiltonian (non-linear) equations of motion. By examining the equilibrium regime produced by such an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, a correspondence between Wigner flow properties and hyperbolic stability boundaries in the phase-space is identified. Explicit analytical expressions for equilibrium-stability parameters are obtained for quantum Gaussian ensembles, wherein information quantifiers driven by Wigner currents are identified. Illustrated by an application to a Harper-like system, the results provide a self-contained analysis for identifying the influence of quantum fluctuations associated to the emergence of phase-space vorticity in order to quantify equilibrium and stability properties of Hamiltonian non-linear dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper explores the metrological limits of temperature sensing in open quantum systems, focusing on non-Gaussian states and their performance compared to Gaussian states under identical energy constraints. It establishes analytic bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and derives scaling laws that highlight when non-Gaussian probes outperform Gaussian ones. The analysis reveals a distinct linear-in-time QFI enhancement unique to Fock states, in contrast to the quadratic scaling of Gaussian states. These findings are supported by numerical simulations and mapped onto experimental platforms like circuit QED.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of non-Gaussian states in temperature sensing is crucial for advancing quantum thermometry. The paper addresses the unresolved metrological limits in open quantum systems, providing insights into the quantum thermodynamic advantage of non-Gaussian states in noisy environments, which is essential for practical quantum technologies. This motivates the exploration of the relationship between resourcefulness (non-Gaussianity) and thermometry, especially in terms of resource efficiency and practical implementation. The significance of this work depends on whether it bridges the gap between theoretical findings and practical applications for quantum sensors in realistic settings.

Method: The authors use a combination of analytical methods, such as deriving bounds on QFI using non-Gaussian states under a time-local master equation, and numerical simulations. They focus on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation, which allows precise scaling analysis without approximating the quantum dynamics. This methodological approach enables them to compare non-Gaussian and Gaussian states and derive exact results applicable to any Gaussian probe state.

Result: The key results are that non-Gaussian states outperform Gaussian states in temperature estimation, particularly in their linear-in-time QFI enhancement. Specifically, Fock states exhibit a unique linear scaling of QFI with time, which is stronger than the quadratic scaling of Gaussian states. These findings are physically intuitive, as non-Gaussianity increases the sensitivity to environmental interactions, providing a tractable method to enable sensing in realistic scenarios. The results are experimentally verifiable through numerical simulations and practical quantum technology platforms such as circuit QED.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the metrological potential of non-Gaussian states in temperature sensing, revealing the conditions under which they outperform Gaussian states. The clear theoretical framework and the development of analytic bounds and scaling laws offer a foundation for extending this work to more complex quantum systems and real-world applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

Abstract: The fundamental metrological limits of temperature sensing in open quantum systems remain largely unresolved, particularly regarding the role of non-Gaussian quantum resources. In this letter, we establish analytic bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation using non-Gaussian states undergoing dissipative bosonic evolution. By focusing on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation, we derive precise scaling laws that elucidate when and how non-Gaussian probes decisively outperform Gaussian states under identical energy constraints. Our analysis uncovers a distinct linear-in-time QFI enhancement unique to Fock states, in contrast to the inherently weaker, quadratic scaling of Gaussian probes. These theoretical insights are substantiated through exact numerical simulations and mapped onto experimentally accessible platforms such as circuit QED. Our results not only clarify the quantum thermometric advantage of non-Gaussianity but also chart a realistic pathway toward harnessing it in noisy quantum technologies.

Abstract: Many spintronic, magnetic-memory, and neuromorphic devices rely on spatially varying magnetic fields. Quantitatively imaging these fields with full vector information over extended areas remains a major challenge. Existing probes either offer nanoscale resolution at the cost of slow scanning, or widefield imaging with limited vector sensitivity or material constraints. Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to bridge this gap, but a practical camera-based vector magnetometry implementation on relevant microstructures has not been demonstrated. Here we adapt a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices. By resolving the Zeeman shifts of the four NV orientations, we reconstruct the stray-field vector generated by microfabricated permalloy structures that host multiple stable remanent states. Our implementation achieves a spatial resolution of $\approx 0.52 ~μ\mathrm{m}$ across an $83~μ\mathrm{m} \times 83~μ\mathrm{m}$ field of view and a peak sensitivity of $ (828 \pm 142)~\mathrm{nT\,Hz^{-1}}$, with acquisition times of only a few minutes. These results establish pulsed widefield NV magnetometry on standard microscopes as a practical and scalable tool for routine vector-resolved imaging of complex magnetic devices.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a cornerstone of classical scientific computing, and there is growing interest in whether quantum computers can accelerate such simulations. To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3}{4}(1+\frac{D}{2})} \times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force. This upper bounds the scaling improvement over classical algorithms by $O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3D}{8}})$. However, our numerical investigations suggest a lower speedup, with a scaling estimate of $O(\mathrm{Re}^{1.936} \times q_M)$ for $D=2$. Our results give robust evidence that small, but nontrivial, quantum advantages can be achieved in the context of CFD, and motivate the need for additional rigorous end-to-end quantum algorithm development.

Abstract: Cubic phase states provide the essential non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum computing. We show that they also offer significant potential for quantum metrology, surpassing the phase-sensing sensitivity of all Gaussian states at equal average photon number. Optimal sensitivity requires only moderate initial squeezing, and the non-Gaussian advantage remains robust against loss and detection noise. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that several experimentally relevant preparation schemes surpass Gaussian limits, in some cases reaching the sensitivity of cubic phase states. Our results establish cubic phase states as a promising resource for quantum-enhanced precision measurements beyond Gaussian limits.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider the problem of searching for the Largest empty rectangle in a 2D map, and the one-dimensional version of the problem is the problem of searching for the largest empty segment. We present a quantum algorithm for the Largest Empty Square problem and the Largest Empty Rectangle of a fixed width $d$ for $n\times n$-rectangular map. Query complexity of the algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ for the square case, and $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d})$ for the rectangle with a fixed width $d$ case, respectively. At the same time, the lower bounds for the classical case are $Ω(n^2)$, and $Ω(nd)$, respectively. The Quantum algorithm for the one-dimensional version of the problem has $O(\sqrt{n}\log n\log\log n)$ query complexity. The quantum lower bound for the problem is $Ω(\sqrt{n})$ which is almost equal to the upper bound up to a log factor. The classical lower bound is $Ω(n)$. So, we obtain the quadratic speed-up for the problem.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Conventional classical solvers are commonly used for solving matrix equation systems resulting from the discretization of SIEs in computational electromagnetics (CEM). However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural "parallelization" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems.

Conclusion: 该方法在量子系统和随机矩阵模型中表现出 promise，但有时精度有限。需要在不同情况下调整方法或寻求改进。

Abstract: We provide a brief overview of approaches for calculating the density of states of quantum systems and random matrix Hamiltonians using the tools of free probability theory. For a given Hamiltonian of a quantum system or a generic random matrix Hamiltonian, which can be written as a sum of two non-commutating operators, one can obtain an expression for the density of states of the Hamiltonian from the known density of states of the two component operators by assuming that these operators are mutually free and by using the free additive convolution. In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states. Subsequently, we describe a perturbation scheme that can be developed from the subordination formulas for the Cauchy transform of the density of states and use it to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the density of states in various models, such as the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble and the Anderson model with on-site disorder.

Motivation:  secure and private voting is crucial for democratic societies, and the increasing reliance on classical systems raises concerns about security threats, driving the need for a quantum-based solution.

Method:  used greenberger-horne-zeilinger (GHZ) states to create an information-theoretically secure voting protocol, implemented the protocol experimentally in two scenarios with 4 voters, 2 candidates, and larger groups.

Result:  the protocol was successfully demonstrated in both small and moderate scale voting settings, highlighting its scalability and security.

Conclusion:  proposed quantum-based voting protocol provides an enhanced security framework for democratic voting processes, offering a promising solution in the era of quantum computation.

Abstract: Quantum information protocols offer significant advantages in properties such as security, anonymity, and privacy for communication and computing tasks. An application where guaranteeing the highest possible security and privacy is critical for democratic societies is electronic voting. As computational power continues to evolve, classical voting schemes may become increasingly vulnerable to information leakage. In this work, we present the experimental demonstration of an information-theoretically secure and efficient electronic voting protocol that, crucially, does not rely on election authorities, leveraging the unique properties of quantum states. Our experiment is based on a high-performance source of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and realizes a proof-of-principle implementation of the protocol in two scenarios: a configuration with four voters and two candidates employing privacy enhancement techniques and an election scenario supporting up to eight voters and sixteen candidates. The latter is particularly well-suited for secure board-level elections within organizations or small-scale governmental contexts.

Abstract: Uncertainty is fundamental in modern power systems, where renewable generation and fluctuating demand make stochastic optimization indispensable. The chance constrained unit commitment problem (UCP) captures this uncertainty but rapidly becomes computationally challenging as the number of scenarios grows. Quantum computing has been proposed as a potential route to overcome such scaling barriers. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of quantum annealing platforms to the chance constrained UCP. Focusing on a scenario approximation, we reformulated the problem as a mixed integer linear program and solved it using DWave hybrid quantum classical solver alongside Gurobi. The hybrid solver proved competitive under strict runtime limits for large scenario sets (15,000 in our experiments), while Gurobi remained superior on smaller cases. QUBO reformulations were also tested, but current annealers cannot accommodate stochastic UCPs due to hardware limits, and deterministic cases suffered from embedding overhead. Our study delineates where chance constrained UCPs can already be addressed with hybrid quantum classical methods, and where current quantum annealers remain fundamentally limited.

Abstract: We propose a formulation of quantum measurement within a modified framework of frames, in which a quantum system - a single qubit - is directly coupled to a classical measurement bit. The qubit is represented as a positive probability distribution over two classical bits, a and a', denoted by p(aa'). The measurement apparatus is described by a classical bit $α= \pm 1$, initialized in the pure distribution $p(α) = \frac{1}{2}(1 + α)$. The measurement interaction is modeled by a quasi-bistochastic process $ S(bb'β\mid aa'α)$ - a bistochastic map that may include negative transition probabilities, while acting on an entirely positive state space. When this process acts on the joint initial state $p(aa')p(α)$, it produces a collapsed state $p(bb'\midβ)$, yielding the measurement outcome $β$ with the correct quantum-mechanical probability $p(β)$. This approach bypasses the von Neumann chain of infinite couplings by treating the measurement register classically, while capturing the nonclassical nature of measurement through the quasi-bistochastic structure of the interaction.

Abstract: The theoretical description of broadband, multimode quantum pulses undergoing a second-order $χ^{(2)}$-nonlinear interaction can be quite intricate, due to the large dimensionality of the underlying phase space. However, in many cases only a few broadband (temporal) modes are relevant before and after the nonlinear interaction. Here we present an efficient framework to calculate the relation between the quantum states at the input and output of a nonlinear element in their respective relevant modes. Since the number of relevant input and output modes may differ, resulting in an open quantum system, we introduce the generalized Bloch-Messiah decomposition (GBMD), reducing the description to an equal number of input and output modes. The GBMD enables us to calculate the multimode Wigner function of the output state by convolving the rescaled Wigner function of the reduced input quantum pulse with a multivariate Gaussian phase-space function. We expand on this result by considering two examples input states: A Fock state in a single broadband mode and a two-mode squeezed vacuum, both in the THz-frequency regime, up-converted to a single output broadband mode of optical frequencies. We investigate the effect, the convolution and thermalization due to entanglement breakage have on the output Wigner function by calculating the von Neumann entropy of the output Wigner function. The methods presented here can be used to optimize the amplification or frequency conversion of broadband quantum states, opening an avenue to the generation and characterization of optical quantum states on ultrafast time scales.

TL;DR: A subclass of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians obeying anti-commutation relations with their conjugates was studied. A Hermitian basis was found that spans the bi-orthonormal energy eigenvectors. Using modified projectors built from these eigenvectors, the generalized density matrix for PT-symmetric evolution was calculated, leading to the determination of ergotropy for a closed system. The PT-symmetric system's behavior under different non-Hermiticity regimes was analyzed in an open system context. Finally, the consistency of the three laws of thermodynamics for the PT-symmetric system in an open system scenario was examined. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding thermostability, entropy, and ergotropy in PT-symmetric systems.

Motivation: PT-symmetric systems have gained significant attention in quantum physics due to their unique properties and potential applications in various fields, including optics, thermodynamics, and condensed matter physics. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of ergotropy and the laws of thermodynamics in such systems, which could have practical implications in both theoretical and applied contexts.

Method: The research employed a combination of mathematical analysis and theoretical modeling. The authors first derived the necessary conditions for a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian to admit a Hermitian basis and then constructed generalized density matrices using modified projectors. Ergotropy was calculated, and the system's behavior under different non-Hermiticity regimes was analyzed. The consistency of thermodynamic laws was verified through rigorous calculations and logical reasoning.

Result: The key results of this study include the identification of a Hermitian basis spanning bi-orthonormal energy eigenvectors for a subclass of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians, the successful calculation of the generalized density matrix and ergotropy for a closed system, the analysis of ergotropy in an open system setup, and the verification of the consistency of the three laws of thermodynamics in PT-symmetric systems. These findings expand our understanding of thermostability, entropy, and ergotropy in PT-symmetric systems.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding ergotropy and thermodynamic laws in PT-symmetric systems, both in closed and open setups. The results have the potential to guide future research in quantum thermodynamics and PT-symmetric physics applications.

Abstract: For a subclass of a general $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric Hamiltonian obeying anti-commutation relation with its conjugate, a Hermitian basis is found that spans the bi-orthonormal energy eigenvectors.

The $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system, in an open system scenario, is studied to understand ergotropy under different regimes of non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian. The consistency of the three laws of thermodynamics for the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system in an open system scenario is also analyzed.

Abstract: The accurate and efficient detection of quantum entanglement remains a central challenge in quantum information science. In this work, we study the detection of entanglement of polarized photons for measurement devices that are solely specified by rotational symmetry. We derive explicit positive operator valued measures (POVMs) showing that from a quantum information perspective any such setting is classified by one real measurable parameter r. In Particular, we give a POVM formulation of the Klein--Nishina formula for Compton scattering of polarized photons. We provide an SDP-based entanglement certification method that operates on the full measured statistics and gives tight bounds, also considering semi-device independent scenarios. Furthermore, we show that, while Bell violations are impossible with rotationally covariant measurements, EPR steering can still be certified under one-sided symmetry constraints. Finally, we present a rotationally covariant showcase experiment, analyzing the scattering of polarized optical light in a selection of soft drinks. Our results suggest that lemonade-based detectors are suitable for entanglement detection.

Abstract: Quantum high-harmonic generation (HHG) is a growing field of research with capabilities of providing high photon-number entangled states of light. However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces TARA, a novel framework for quantum anomaly detection combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing. The framework provides rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios. TARA offers two approaches: TARA k for quantum-classical discrimination with high accuracy and TARA-m for real-time monitoring with anytime valid error control. Theoretically, the framework confirming conformal prediction validity even under exchangeability conditions and demonstrating significant security margins across quantum processors, revealing a potential bias in standard calibration methods used in prior research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring Security in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) through rigorous certification methods that provide statistical guarantees under finite-sample and adversarial conditions is crucial for practical implementations. This paper aims to address the limitations in existing certification methods by introducing a robust framework for quantum anomaly detection.

Method: The paper introduces the TARA framework, which combines conformal prediction and sequential martingale testing. TARA k is based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, while TARA-m employs betting martingales for streaming detection. Theoretical proofs establish the framework's validity under exchangeability conditions, and extensive validation is conducted on IBM Torino and IonQ quantum processors.

Result: The TARA framework demonstrates robust performance across different quantum processors, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Notably, it reveals that same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points, suggesting potential biases in current certification methods.

Conclusion: TARA represents a significant advancement in the certification of QKD security, providing rigorous statistical guarantees and practical benefits for real-world implementations. However, the potential biases in calibration methods indicate the need for further refinement in future studies to ensure accurate and robust certification.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) security fundamentally relies on the ability to distinguish genuine quantum correlations from classical eavesdropper simulations, yet existing certification methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios. We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness.

Abstract: We introduce a finite-time protocol that thermalizes a quantum harmonic oscillator, initially in its ground state, without requiring a macroscopic bath. The method uses a second oscillator as an effective environment and implements sudden quenches of the oscillator frequencies and coupling. Owing to the Gaussian nature of the dynamics, the thermalization condition reduces to three solvable equations, yielding exact analytic solutions for a dense discrete set of temperatures and numerical solutions in all other cases. Any target temperature can be approximated with arbitrary precision, with a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The simplicity of the protocol makes it a promising tool for rapid, controlled thermalization in quantum thermodynamics experiments and state preparation.

Abstract: The discovery of Bell that there exist quantum correlations that cannot be reproduced classically is one of the most important in the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as having practical implications. Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.

Abstract: As a contribution towards quantizing three-dimensional gravity, we show at the classical level that Euclidean three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant is uplifted to the $SU(2)$-invariant sector of Kodaira-Spencer gravity on a Calabi-Yau three-fold. Kodaira-Spencer gravity appears in the target space description of the B-model topological string theory and describes deformations of a complex structure. We prove that given a reference solution of Einstein gravity in the first-order formulation, a second off-shell configuration uplifts to a unique complex structure deformation in six dimensions. If the configuration satisfies Einstein's equations, the complex structure deformation is integrable, i.e. a solution of Kodaira-Spencer gravity. We demonstrate the uplift explicitly for Bañados solutions. Our construction embeds three-dimensional gravity into topological string theory and AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality into twisted holography.

Abstract: We develop techniques to treat massive Kaluza-Klein modes to arbitrary order in perturbation theory. The Higgs mechanism that renders the higher Kaluza-Klein modes massive is displayed. To this end we give an algorithm in perturbation theory that yields new fields with the following characteristics: they are gauge invariant under all higher-mode gauge transformations, which are broken, but they transform covariantly under the zero-mode gauge transformations, which are unbroken. We employ the formulation of field theory in terms of $L_{\infty}$ algebras together with their homotopy transfer, which here maps the gauge redundant fields of gravity to gauge invariant fields. We illustrate these results, as a proof of concept, for Kaluza-Klein theory on a torus. In an accompanying paper these results will be applied to a large class of generalized Scherk-Schwarz backgrounds in exceptional field theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the equation of motion of the Euclidean IKKT matrix model, and realize a new type of classical saddle that only exists in $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit. Under the assumption that the matrices are the generators of $\mathfrak{so}(n,m)$, we identify a unique solution, that is, $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. Even though it has $6$ generators and thus $6$ non-zero matrices, they are not independent due to the $2$ Casimir constraints in $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. Exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure and the Casimir constraints, we derive the effective metric that a test probe propagates on. The resulting effective metric exhibits an $SO(3)$ symmetry, matching the spatial symmetry of our universe.

Abstract: We review aspects of entanglement entropy in the quantum mechanics of $N\times N$ matrices, i.e. matrix quantum mechanics (MQM), at large $N$. In doing so we review standard models of MQM and their relation to string theory, D-brane physics, and emergent non-commutative geometries. We overview, in generality, definitions of subsystems and entanglement entropies in theories with gauge redundancy and discuss the additional structure required for definining subsystems in MQMs possessing a $U(N)$ gauge redundancy. In connecting these subsystems to non-commutative geometry, we review several works on `target space entanglement,' and entanglement in non-commutative field theories, highlighting the conditions in which target space entanglement entropy displays an `area law' at large $N$. We summarize several example calculations of entanglement entropy in non-commutative geometries and MQMs. We review recent work in connecting the area law entanglement of MQM to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, highlighting the conditions in which $U(N)$ invariance implies a minimal area formula for the entanglement entropy at large $N$. Finally, we make comments on open questions and research directions.

Abstract: Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L μ_L = c_R μ_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct charges for four-dimensional spacetimes with a non-vanishing cosmological constant, including charges that are not conserved because of a leaky boundary and charges associated with corner terms in the symplectic current. The construction leads to manifestly finite charges for any choice of boundary conditions, and reveals new charges in partial Bondi gauge for an enlarged class of field configurations which are not fully on-shell, including a Weyl charge for conformal boundary conditions. In addition, we generalize the variational principle for AdS$_4$ gravity with Dirichlet boundary conditions to a wedge of spacetime where the conformal boundary includes a corner. The boundary data is completely general, with no conditions restricting time dependence or the determinant of the metric. The Ward identities associated with boundary diffeomorphisms are shown to reproduce the evolution equations for the mass and angular momentum of fully on-shell field configurations.

Motivation: 这项研究的核心动机是探索CFT及相关理论中的内核结构及其应用。

Method: 研究采用分析方法，具体方法包括：对内核的表达式进行解析，研究其性质和行为，以及基于这些性质进行推导和证明。

Result: 我们证明：对于所有合理数参数b²∈ℚ×，结合内核的解决方案可以表示为两种不同内核的线性组合。这表明内核空间比先前认为的更大，且它们在Liouville动量上有平方根分支点奇点而不具有反射对称性。这种跨现象表明了Liouville理论在不同参数域中的复杂性和一致性，尤其是在c∈ℚ左半区中的自我一致性和模对称性。

Conclusion: 我们得出结论，无论参数域如何改变，内核的行为在本质上类似于 semiclassical 和一阶精确，这在二维共形 Bootstrap 及三维 TQFT 中有一个负 cosmological 常数的纯 3d 量子引力中具有重要意义。

Abstract: We report novel analytic results for the Virasoro modular and fusion kernels relevant to 2d conformal field theories (CFTs), 3d topological field theories (TQFTs), and the representation theory of certain quantum groups. For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\infty,1]\cup[25,\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant.

Abstract: We construct a generalized Yang-Mills (YM) theory with two real couplings, interpolating continuously between the Self-Dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) limit (also called Chalmers-Siegel theory) and physical Yang-Mills theory. The kinetic coupling $ε$ controls local fluctuations and anti-instanton weight, while the topological coupling $g$ controls the instanton weight. Both couplings are asymptotically free. We derive an exact all-order relation between the beta functions of the two couplings, revealing a Renormalization Group invariant, a new dimensionless expansion parameter $Λ_ε/ Λ_g$ into the study of YM theory. In the SDYM limit, the vacuum is populated by a finite density of topological defects, yet local correlators decay algebraically, consistent with a non-unitary conformal field theory. We confirm this mechanism via compactification on arbitrary size $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$, where the vacuum maps to a non-interacting ideal gas of monopole-instantons. As the kinetic coupling is turned on, a mass gap and confinement scale emerge.

TL;DR: The paper examines the chiral symmetry breaking minima and other potential minima in supersymmetric symplectic QCD perturbed by Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB). It finds that all Sp(N_c) theories to which AMSB can be applied (N_f < 3(N_c + 1)) possess stable chiral symmetry breaking minima, which are plausibly continuously connected to the vacua of QCD-like Sp(N_c) theories for large SUSY breaking and are protected from runaways to incalculable minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of minimally supersymmetric theories under SUSY-breaking is a central task in theoretical particle physics. Exploring the chiral symmetry breaking minima and potential minima in such models is essential for building a consistent picture of low-energy physics in these theories.

Method: The authors conduct a detailed analysis of the moduli space of the theory, focusing on the conditions for the existence of stable chiral symmetry breaking minima. They employ methods from algebraic geometry and analysis to map out the structure of the moduli space and identify the regions where such minima exist.

Result: The authors conclude that all Sp(N_c) theories to which AMSB can be applied exhibit stable chiral symmetry breaking minima. These minima are smoothly connected to the large SUSY-breaking limits, providing a stable ultraviolet completion for these theories.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of the vacuum structure of supersymmetric theories with Sp(N_c) gauge groups under AMSB. The stable chiral symmetry breaking minima identified suggest that these theories can consistently serve as a foundation for low-energy effective theories in particle physics.

Abstract: We present a careful study of the chiral symmetry breaking minima and other potential minima in supersymmetric symplectic QCD ($Sp(N_c)$ with $N_f$ flavors) perturbed by Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB). Although the case of $N_f = N_c +1$ requires particular care due to the inherently strongly coupled nature of the quantum modified moduli space, we are able to show that all $Sp(N_c)$ theories to which AMSB can be applied ($N_f < 3(N_c + 1)$) possess stable chiral symmetry breaking minima, which are plausibly continuously connected to the vacua of QCD-like $Sp(N_c)$ theories for large SUSY breaking, and are protected from runaways to incalculable minima.

Abstract: The scattering equations relate massless scattering kinematics to marked points on a Riemann sphere, and underpin remarkable formulae for the full tree-level S-matrices of many interesting QFTs, including cubic biadjoint scalars, Yang-Mills theory and general relativity. The scattering equations arise from worldsheet correlators of ambitwistor string theories, which has enabled their generalisation to anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in certain cases. In this paper, we use the scattering equations and ambitwistor strings to prove the correspondence between an appropriate flat limit of boundary correlators in AdS and Carrollian scattering amplitudes -- massless amplitudes written in position space on the null conformal boundary -- for any number of external states and spacetime dimensions in tree-level, cubic scalar theories. We first derive the Carrollian version of the scattering equations in Minkowski space and their associated Carrollian amplitude formulae, by direct Fourier transform from momentum space and from ambitwistor strings with a Carrollian basis of vertex operators. We then take the flat limit of known formulae for all tree-level boundary correlators of cubic scalar theories in AdS, recovering the Carrollian amplitudes in flat space. In the special case of AdS$_3$, we also make some comments on the flat space limit of spinning boundary correlators.

TL;DR: The paper analyze integral kernels for functions of a minimal second-order differential operator on curved spacetime, showing they can be expanded similarly to the DeWitt expansion. The authors separate the information related to the operator and the function into two types: HaMiDeW coefficients and basis/massive kernels. They calculate these for operator functions of the form exp(-τ F^ν)/(F^μ + λ) using Mellin-Barnes integrals, addressing issues like term-by-term integration validity, IR divergence regularization, and physical interpretation of the expansions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study is relevant for understanding the mathematical structure of quantum field theory on curved spacetime, particularly in areas like quantum gravity or cosmology.

Method: The authors employ functional analysis and expansions similar to the DeWitt heat kernel technique, using Mellin-Barnes integrals to calculate the required kernels. They rigorously address convergence issues and regularization of divergent integrals.

Result: The expansion separates the operator's bundle geometry from the function's functional form, providing a clear separation of data encoded in the two types of kernels. This leads to a novel understanding of operator functions on curved spacetime with applications in theoretical physics.

Conclusion: This paper provides a significant mathematical framework for analyzing operator functions on curved spacetime, offering a new approach to handle IR divergences and understand the operator's properties through their kernel expansions.

Abstract: We consider integral kernels for functions $f(\hat F)$ of a minimal second-order differential operator $\hat F(\nabla)$ on a curved spacetime. We show that they can be expanded in a functional series, analogous to the DeWitt expansion for the heat kernel, by integrating the latter term-by-term. This procedure leads to a separation of two types of data: all information about the bundle geometry and the operator $\hat F(\nabla)$ is still contained in the standard HaMiDeW coefficients $\hat a_k[F | x,x']$ (we call this property ``off-diagonal functoriality''), while information about the function $f$ is encoded in some new scalar functions $\mathbb{B}_α[f | σ]$ and $\mathbb{W}_α[f | σ, m^2]$, which we call basis and complete massive kernels, respectively. These objects are calculated for operator functions of the form $\exp(-τ\hat F^ν)/(\hat F^μ+ λ)$ as multiple Mellin--Barnes integrals. The article also discusses subtle issues such as the validity of the term-by-term integration, the regularization of IR divergent integrals, and the physical interpretation of the resulting expansions.

Abstract: We construct a novel effective field theory for a compact body coupled to gravity, whose key feature is that the dynamics of gravitational perturbations is explicitly determined by known solutions in black hole perturbation theory in four dimensions. In this way, the physics of gravitational perturbations in curved space are already encoded in the effective field theory, thus bypassing the need for the higher-order calculations that constitute a major hurdle in standard approaches. Concretely, we model the compact body as a spherical shell, whose finite size regulates short-distance divergences in four dimensions and whose tidal responses are described by higher-dimensional operators. As an application, we consider scalar perturbations and derive new results for scalar Love numbers through ${\cal O} (G^9)$ for Schwarzschild black holes and for generic compact bodies. Finally, our analysis reveals an intriguing structure of the scalar black-hole Love numbers in terms of the Riemann zeta function, which we conjecture to hold to all orders.

Conclusion: 这项研究扩展了AdS/CFT对偶性，揭示了三维至六度空间中M-理论与CFT之间的深层联系。

Abstract: We consider M-theory on the backgrounds AdS$_4\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{N_f}$ and AdS$_7\times S^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$, which have fixed point locii AdS$_{d+1}\times S^3$ for $d=3,6$. These theories are holographically dual to certain CFTs in $d=3,6$ with eight supercharges. We compute the bulk cubic couplings between graviton KK modes and gluon KK modes living on the fixed points of these theories, which are generically extremal. We use these couplings to compute the graviton exchange term that appears in the strong coupling expansion of holographic correlators of gluon KK modes $\langle 22pp\rangle$ in these theories, and check that it matches the expected flat space limit. We express the answer in terms of a new reduced correlator solution to the superconformal Ward identities, which we derive for all CFTs with eight supercharges in $3\leq d\leq6$.

Abstract: The dynamics of N=1 SUSY gauge theories with matter in adjoint and fundamental representations and the superpotentials given by Arnold's ADE singularities has been extensively studied in the literature. It was also conjectured that supersymmetric models with $W_{A_k}$, $W_{D_{k+2}}$ and $W_{E_7}$ superpotentials possess a dual description. In this paper we revisit the analysis of the moduli space of $A_k$ and $D_{k+2}$ models by considering the duality along nilpotent directions on the moduli space. While our analysis provides additional evidence for the duality conjecture in $W_{A_k}$ models, we show that the duality conjecture fails for the $W_{D_{k+2}}$ models.

TL;DR:  paper discusses the Tomimatsu--Sato (TS) family and its relation to integrable systems like the YTSF equation. It shows how the TS geometry fits into a τ-function hierarchy in stationary axisymmetric general relativity. This helps link exact solutions to integrable systems in spacetime structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Since algebro-integrable systems have applications in mathematical physics, understanding how specific geometries fit into such frameworks is important for exploring exact solutions and integrability in relativity. This paper contributes to connecting TS black holes with integrable systems, aiding in the study of exact solutions, their algebraic properties, and possible applications in physics and mathematics.

Method:  The paper employs techniques like the Ernst potential, τ ratio (τ₁/τ₀), and Hirota operators. It decomposes the Einstein equations into cubic and quartic parts, identifies symmetric structures, and connects to specific integrable equations. This analytical approach allows linking the TS geometry to known integrable systems, thereby uncovering hidden mathematical structures.

Result:  The study reveals an integrable structure within the TS family, specifically through a cubic quartic hierarchy linked to the YTSF equation for δ=2. This shows that the TS geometry naturally emerges from integrable τ-function hierarchies, offering a deeper understanding of its formation and properties in general relativity. The result provides insights into the algebraic and integrative properties of black hole solutions, contributing to the theoretical framework for exact spacetime solutions.

Conclusion:  The paper concludes that the TS family exhibits an integrable τ-function structure, representing a significant step in connecting exact solutions in general relativity with integrable systems. This has implications for advanced studies in mathematical physics and for generating explicit models in gravitational theories. The results support the TS metric as a member of a broader class of solutions with inherent integrable properties. mastered technologies and tools enhance understanding of complex spacetime structures.

Abstract: The Tomimatsu--Sato (TS) family generalizes the Kerr black hole to higher multipole order $δ$ and has long been regarded as algebraically complicated without any clear integrability. We show instead that stationary axisymmetric vacuum Einstein equations, when the Ernst potential is written as a $τ$--ratio $\mathcal{E}=τ_1/τ_0$, admit a universal decomposition of the Ernst numerator into a cubic part containing all second derivatives and a quartic \emph{gradient envelope}. The cubic sector can be written in terms of $Z_3$--symmetric trilinear Hirota operators, revealing a hidden integrable structure. For $δ=2$, using the explicit Tomimatsu--Sato polynomials, we verify that this trilinear sector coincides with a Yu--Toda--Sasa--Fukuyama (YTSF) equation-type kernel. Thus the TS geometry forms a gravitational realization of a multilinear $τ$--function hierarchy in stationary axisymmetric general relativity.

Abstract: We have sifted through astrophysical data collected by various radial velocity and gravitational microlensing searches for exoplanets with the goal of identifying potential signs of the presence of primordial black holes (PBH). Our motivation is that those hypothesized remnants of inhomogeneous energetic fluctuations in the early universe, though too small for direct detection, are thought to have a mass range similar to that of planets. Thereby, if captured by stars, they could conceivably make their presence known through stellar wobbles picked up by means of Doppler spectroscopy in the radial velocity method, or alternatively through microlensing. In our analysis of such data, we have identified potential PBH contenders by ruling out any exoplanet candidates that have been detected through direct imaging or transit methods, as they would have sizes consistent with planets rather than PBHs. In particular we focus on the objects Kepler-21 Ac, HD 219134 f, Gliese 686 b, HR 5183 b, HD 20794 e, and Wolf 1061 d, each of which has been found using the radial velocity method but never imaged (either directly or through transit). We also examine the microlensing events MOA 2009-BLG-387L and OGLE-2016-BLG-1540, which offer promise as candidate PBHs. We present these as a representative, but not exclusive list, of potential PBH contenders. Furthermore, future imaging, especially focused on signals of planetary dimensions versus evaporation signatures, might clarify which of these are indeed exoplanets.

### [66] [Inferring black hole formation channels in GWTC-4.0 via parametric mass-spin correlations derived from first principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03152)
*Emanuele Berti,Francesco Crescimbeni,Gabriele Franciolini,Simone Mastrogiovanni,Paolo Pani,Grégoire Pierra*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper compares various formation scenarios for binary black holes (BBHs) using data from GWTC-4.0. The analysis finds that a positive mass-spin correlation is supported, particularly by second-generation mergers. The spins' orientation is less constraining, but the primordial scenario doesn’t fit well with the data. The hierarchical Bayesian models show that the scenario with isolated stellar evolution, dense clusters, AGN disks, and primordial BHs has the best fit. The data supports this model over the primordial one but doesn’t provide strong evidence for or against the other processes like spins being aligned or random. However, more data is needed to confirm these conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the formation and properties of binary black holes is crucial for interpreting gravitational wave observations and testing theories of gravity and black hole physics. The paper aims to distinguish between different formation mechanisms by analyzing the spin and mass correlations in the data.

Method: The authors used hierarchical Bayesian inference on the GWTC-4.0 dataset to compare models of BBH formation scenarios. They incorporated parameterized models that predict spin-mass correlations based on first principles, considering factors like stellar evolution, dense clusters, AGN disks, and primordial black holes.

Result: The study reveals that the observed data supports scenarios involving isolated stellar evolution, dense clusters, AGN disks, and primordial black holes. A positive correlation between black hole mass and spin magnitude is found, with second-generation mergers contributing more spins at larger masses. Spin orientations are less constrained, with the cluster and AGN scenarios being less distinguished by the current data. The primordial scenario is inconsistent with the data and accounts for fewer observed events.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a hierarchical formation model, involving a mix of isolated stellar evolution, dense clusters, AGN disks, and primordial black holes, provides the best fit to the data. The evidence favors this model significantly over the primordial one but does not conclusively rule out the cluster and AGN scenarios, which require more data to distinguish.

Abstract: We investigate the differences between several proposed formation scenarios for binary black holes (BBHs), including isolated stellar evolution, dynamical assembly in dense clusters and AGN disks, and primordial BHs. Our approach exploits the predicted spin features of each formation channel, and adopts parameterized models of the predicted correlations between the spin magnitudes (and orientations) and mass, inspired by first principles. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence. Finally, the mass-spin correlation predicted by the primordial scenario gives a poor fit to the data, and this scenario can only account for a subset of the observed events.

Abstract: We study, for the first time, the evolution of a scalar cloud bound to an evaporating black hole. Our simulations of the associated Schrödinger-Poisson system for non-relativistic and spherically symmetric clouds reveal that a scalar cloud may (partially) survive as a self-gravitating boson star if the black hole evaporates adiabatically until its mass becomes less than one half of the cloud's mass. This yields a novel mechanism for boson star formation and shows that, as previously conjectured, bosonic dark matter production by light primordial black holes may result in micro-boson stars with very large occupation numbers, greatly enhancing their potential detectability even for very weakly interacting dark matter particles.

Abstract: Many of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics, such as the strength of electromagnetism or the masses of elementary particles, must lie in precise ranges for stars, planets, and chemistry to exist. Why the universe has such these values is one of the deepest questions in science. Here we propose that these constants arise from quantum mechanics itself. By enlarging the configuration space of quantum cosmology, we treat the constants of nature as part of the wavefunction of the universe. The universal wavefunction contains support for many possible sets of constants, and early-universe processes cause these possibilities to decohere into distinct classical universes. Our universe is one such branch, compatible with complexity and life. We defined the Grand Hilbert Space as the direct sum of U-sectors, each representing a distinct set of physical laws. We derived the Meta-Wheeler--DeWitt equation, which governs the dynamics of the theory parameters. We showed that in the Planck era, the kinetic terms for these parameters are active, creating a state of primordial coherence where the laws of physics effectively fluctuate. This formalism offers a quantitative tool for high-energy physics. We proposed that the total integrated amplitude over theory space serves as a Bayesian evidence metric, allowing for the statistical comparison of rival microscopic theories based on their fertility in generating habitable sectors. Finally, this work makes a specific, falsifiable prediction: there will never be a successful, purely mathematical derivation of the Standard Model parameters.

Abstract: Can the thermodynamic arrow of time in a single universe be reversed, even temporarily, within semiclassical gravity without invoking additional universes or branches? We address this question in a single, connected spacetime where quantum field theory is coupled to classical general relativity, and where black holes, traversable wormholes, and time-symmetric or retrocausal formulations of quantum mechanics might naively appear to open channels for entropy export or cancellation. After distinguishing fine-grained, coarse-grained, and generalized gravitational entropy, and formulating a cosmological coarse-grained entropy, we treat black hole evaporation, wormholes constrained by quantum energy inequalities, and two-time boundary-value frameworks (including absorber-type and two-state-vector formalisms) within a common information-theoretic language. We then introduce a "Global Entropy Transport" (GET) framework and derive a sectoral inequality that bounds the net decrease of matter-plus-radiation entropy in terms of changes in horizon area and correlation (mutual-information) terms, assuming the generalized second law and modern focusing and energy conditions. Within this framework, black holes, wormholes, and retrocausal protocols can at most redistribute entropy among matter, radiation, and gravitational sectors and reshape the local pattern of entropy production. They do not, under current semiclassical, holographic, and statistical-mechanical constraints, permit a genuine reversal of the universal thermodynamic arrow in a single connected universe.

Method: the radial motion is treated as the same equation as without the magnetic field, but the magnetic field significantly affects the motion in other directions.

Result: horizons and fields

Conclusion: Charged test particles' motions are significantly influenced by magnetic fields, especially in confined and extreme environments like near black holes.

Abstract: We study the motion of a charged test particle in the spacetime with a spherically symmetric black hole which is immersed in a monopole magnetic field. We show that the radial motion of the charged test particle is governed by completely the same equation as that in the case of no magnetic field. This result implies that the black hole will acquire the electric charge if it is surrounded by the collisionless plasma composed of protons and electrons which obey the Maxwell velocity distribution. The drastically different situation appears in the tangential motions of charged test particles due to the magnetic field. The trajectory of a charged test particle in the black hole with the magnetic field of the order of 10 Gauss near the black hole, is confined on a very thin cone as long as the specific angular momentum of the particle is not much larger than the gravitational radius of the black hole times the speed of light. This result leads to a possibility that a plasma lump can hover over the black hole and is very hot, in the monopole magnetic field.

Motivation: The study uses black-hole solutions of covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to confront it with stringent probes like black-hole shadows and the Event Horizon Telescope measurements to validate its applicability.

Method: The research employs static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory and utilizes EHT data, S2-star precession, and gravitational lensing to analyze deviations from the Schwarzschild model.

Result: Case I shows minimal deviations, while Case II offers significant corrections that could be observable, with EHT data providing tight bounds and strong lensing enhancing these constraints.

Conclusion: Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity's strong-field predictions are open to future testing using advanced imaging and precise measurements.

Abstract: Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.

Abstract: By solving a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in Kerr geometry, we uncover new phenomena and key characteristics of quantized vortices in quantum fluids near a Kerr black hole. The formation of these vortices induces rotational or turbulent flows, which profoundly alter the fluid properties and revise those dark matter models describing axion condensates, ultralight boson clouds, and other scalar fields in the vicinity of spinning black holes. As macroscopic, quantum, and topological defects, these vortices can stably orbit the black hole over extended periods, establishing their viability as novel probes for investigating black hole physics. For instance, we calculate the angular velocities of orbiting vortices to quantitatively characterize the frame-dragging effect, a classic prediction of general relativity. Additionally, we observe that relatively large vortices are accreted onto the black hole, wrapping around it while undergoing splitting and reconnecting processes. In quantum fluids with high vortex densities, turbulent flows emerge, accompanied by the formation of a vortex boundary layer near the event horizon. Beyond the ergosphere, we find vortex emissions and energetic outbursts, which may provide crucial insights into analogous astrophysical events recently discovered by the XRISM satellite.

Abstract: The reduction of dynamical systems which are invariant under changes of global scale is well-understood, for classical theories of particles, and fields. The excision of the superfluous degree of freedom describing such a scale leads to a dynamically-equivalent theory, which is frictional in nature. In this article, we extend the formalism to physical models, of both particles and fields, described by singular Lagrangians. Our treatment of classical field theory is based on the manifestly covariant Hamilton De-Donder Weyl formalism, in which the Lagrangian density is introduced as a bundle morphism on the pre-multisymplectic velocity phase space $J^1E$. The results obtained are subsequently applied to a number of physically-motivated examples, as well as a discussion presented on the implications of our work for classical General Relativity.

Abstract: We obtain relativistic solutions of spherically symmetric accretion by a dynamical analysis of a generalised Hamiltonian for higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordström (RN) Black Hole (BH). We consider two different fluids namely, an isotropic fluid and a non-linear polytropic fluid to analyse the critical points in a higher-dimensional RN BH. The flow dynamics of the fluids are studied in different spacetime dimensions in the framework of Hamiltonian formalism. The isotropic fluid is found to have both transonic and non-transonic flow behaviour, but in the case of polytropic fluid, the flow behaviour is found to exhibit only non-transonic flow, determined by a critical point that is related to the local sound speed. The critical radius is found to change with the spacetime dimensions. Starting from the usual four dimensions it is noted that as the dimension increases the critical radius decreases, attains a minimum at a specific dimension ($D>4$) and thereafter increases again. The mass accretion rate for isotropic fluid is determined using Hamiltonian formalism. The maximum mass accretion rate for RN BH with different equations of state parameters is studied in addition to spacetime dimensions. The flow behaviour and mass accretion rate for a change in BH charge is also studied analytically. It is noted that the maximum mass accretion rate in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH is the lowest, which however, increases with the increase in charge parameter in a higher-dimensional RN BH.

*Shitong Guo,Yan-Gang Miao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Black holes can reveal strong-field gravity through their unique spectroscopy. Current modified gravity tests rely on waveform models of general relativity, but this might introduce systematics and limit applicability. A new hierarchical Bayesian framework connects ringdown observations (damped sinusoids) with theoretical quasinormal modes, bypassing waveform matching. It includes a soft-truncation module for finite parameter space validity and quantitative diagnostics for stable analysis windows. Applied to GW250114 in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, it shows a robust posterior for the coupling ζ, though limited information. Limited by parameter space, coupling values might partially absorb spectral deviations. The framework is flexible and sets a foundation for future strong-field gravity tests with next-generation detectors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong-field gravity testing using black hole spectroscopy is crucial for understanding gravity theories beyond general relativity. Current methods face limitations in model-specific biases and applicability. A new methodology bridging ringdown observations and theoretical models could enhance precision and reduce systematics.

Method: A theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework is developed to connect ringdown observations (damped sinusoids) with quasinormal mode spectra. It uses a soft-truncation module for parameter space validity and includes diagnostics for stable analysis windows. The framework is implemented within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and applied to GW250114. Bayesian inference is used to analyze the coupling ζ's posterior distribution, demonstrating robustness against priors and limited information.

Result: The analysis of GW250114 in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and simulation studies reveal that the posterior for ζ is robust against prior assumptions but remains weakly informative. The framework shows potential to recover zero coupling values, yet Kerr-based priors may partially absorb spectral deviations from alternative gravity theories.

Conclusion: This work provides a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, offering a novel approach to studying strong-field physics without relying on waveform models.

Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful probe of strong-field gravity in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $ζ$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $ζ$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $ζ$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.

Method: Simulations of the three-body system using different approximations and modifications were conducted to assess their impact on stability.

Result: PM approximation and MOND destabilize the system, while MOGA modification enhances stability.

Conclusion: Approximations and modifications like PM and MOND can significantly affect the stability of celestial systems, whereas MOGA seems more effective in maintaining stability.

Abstract: Large-scale simulations of celestial systems are based on approximations or modifications of classical dynamics. The approximations are with ``particle-mesh'' (PM) substitutions of the attractions from objects far away, or one modify the Newtonian accelerations (MOND) or the gravities (MOGA). The PM approximation and MOND modification of classical dynamics break the invariances of classical dynamics. The simple three-body system (TBS) is the simplest system to test the approximations and modifications of celestial dynamics, and it is easy to implement on a computer. Simulations of the TBS show that the PM approximation and MOND destabilize TBS. In contrast, the MOGA modification of gravity by replacing Newton's inverse square attraction with an inverse attraction for far-away interactions stabilizes the system. The PM approximation and the MOND modification of classical dynamics do not preserve the momentum and angular momentum of a conservative system exactly, and PM does not obey Newton's third law. Although the errors and shortcomings of these PM approximations and MOND modifications are small, they cause the instability of the regular dynamics.

Abstract: Motivated by integrating the dilaton field (as a UV correction) with dRGT-like massive gravity (as an IR correction) into Einstein gravity, we investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of black holes within this gravitational framework. We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $β$, $α$, and the massive parameters ($η_{1}$ and $η_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dilaton coupling constant ($α$), charge ($q$), the massive gravity parameter ($η_1$), and the graviton mass ($m_g$) on the radius of the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadow. Moreover, the theoretical shadow radius is compared to the observational data from $Sgr A^*$. Additionally, we investigate the energy emission rate of these black holes, revealing that these parameters substantially influence the emission peak.

Abstract: In order to explain the late-time acceleration of the Universe, we present a reconstructed version of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory in this work, which is inspired by the integrating the fractional holographic dark energy with the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff. This reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity model shows a geometrically motivated dark energy component and naturally recovers General Relativity in the appropriate limit. The free parameters of the model are constrained using the latest DESI BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ exhibits excellent consistency with observational data, with high values of $R^2$ and low values of $χ^2_{\min}$, AIC, and BIC, confirming the model's strong statistical performance relative to $Λ$CDM. With current $q(0) \in [-0.40, -0.32]$ and a transition redshift $z_{\text{tr}} \sim 0.56$--$0.72$, the dynamical diagnostics show a smooth transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase. While the $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a negative slope, indicating that the model is not $Λ$CDM, the effective equation-of-state parameter $ω_{\text{eff}}(z)$ stays within the quintessence regime ($-1 < ω_{\text{eff}} < -1/3$). The analysis of classical energy conditions shows that the WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied throughout the cosmic evolution, with a violation of the SEC at lower-redshift, which is consistent with late-time acceleration. Linear homogeneous perturbation analysis further confirms the model's dynamical stability. Conclusively, the FHDE-inspired reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity provides a stable, observationally compatible, and geometrically motivated alternative to $Λ$CDM, that successfully describes the late-time cosmic acceleration within the symmetric teleparallel framework.

Abstract: Naked singularities are hypothetical astrophysical entities featuring gravitational singularities without event horizons. In this study, we analyze the shadow properties of Kerr Modified Gravity (Kerr MOG) naked singularities (KMNSs). We show that the KMNS shadow can appear closed, open, or even vanish, depending on the dimensionless spin parameter a, the modified gravity parameter alpha, and the observer's inclination angle. We identify the critical conditions under which the KMNS shadow develops a gap, a unique feature not present in BH shadows. We analyze the properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding a KMNS, within the framework of MOG characterized by the parameter alpha. The study includes a detailed examination of the spacetime geometry and the equations of motion for test particles. In addition, we adopt a simplified model for the disk's radiative flux, temperature distribution, and spectral luminosity. Our analysis primarily focuses on the flux distribution of the accretion disk around KMNS with identical mass but varying spin and MOG deformation parameters. This allows us to explore how modifications in rotation and the MOG parameter alpha influence the radiative properties of the disk. Further, these observational signatures may serve as effective tools for clearly distinguishing KMNS from standard Kerr naked singularities (KNSs), where the MOG parameter alpha = 0

Abstract: In this work, we investigate tensor perturbations in a de Sitter background within the framework of Chern-Simons modified gravity. We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology.

Abstract: We study black holes in shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity extended by a cubic Galileon interaction with a distinct energy scale. Introducing this hierarchy profoundly modifies the theory's phenomenology. The cubic interaction allows for smaller black holes, and can generate a screening mechanism near the horizon, making large Gauss-Bonnet couplings consistent with gravitational-wave bounds. Observable quantities such as the scalar charge, the innermost stable circular orbit, and its frequency are most affected for small black holes. The resulting multi-scale effective field theory remains technically natural and offers new avenues to probe gravity in the strong-field regime.

Abstract: Reliable operation of high-power proton cyclotrons is a critical requirement for Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) and other large-scale applications. Beam tuning in such machines is traditionally performed manually, a process that can be slow, non-optimal, and difficult to execute in the presence of faults or changing conditions. To address this, we developed and deployed a machine learning (ML) based tuning framework on the Injector 2 cyclotron at PSI, chosen as an ideal testbed for high-power operation. The system combined a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm with real-time diagnostics and control, and incorporated accelerator-physics inspired adaptations such as an overshoot strategy that reduced magnetic field settling times by nearly a factor of six. Over an extensive 12-day operational test campaign, relatively long in the context of real-time ML experiments, the ML agent successfully tuned the machine across multiple operating points, achieving convergence within hours and maintaining stable beam extraction with reduced losses. Beyond initial tuning, the system was also operated in evaluation mode overnight, where it autonomously monitored and corrected the machine to compensate for drifts, demonstrating robustness and long-term stability. Crucially, the learned policy generalized reliably from low-current training to higher-current operation, underscoring its scalability. These results constitute the first demonstration of ML-assisted tuning on a high-power cyclotron, with direct relevance to ADS-class drivers.

TL;DR: A multiscale model of retinal hemodynamics that couples 1D vasculature with capillary-tissue systems using an analytic solution for faster computation was developed. The model showed mathematical robustness and high predictive accuracy. By exploring the influence of various parameters, the model elucidated key factors in controlling retinal hemodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding retinal hemodynamics is crucial for identifying and treating various retinal diseases. The complexity of the retinal vasculature and its interaction with surrounding tissues make modeling this system particularly challenging. Thus, the motivation to develop a robust, multiscale model becomes clear.

Method: A multiscale modeling approach was employed, integrating one-dimensional models for arteries and veins with coupled Darcy equations for capillaries and interstitial tissue. An analytic solution for the capillary-tissue coupled system was utilized, which provided a simplified interpretation and efficient computation.

Result: The analytic solution introduced a dynamic coupling condition between capillary beds and nearby arterial/venous flows. The mathematical analysis revealed the model's truncation error and convergence properties, ensuring its reliability. The model's predictive accuracy was validated against experimental data, and it outperformed other models in interpreting retinal hemodynamic phenomena.

Conclusion: This study contributes a novel multiscale modeling framework for retinal hemodynamics, supported by rigorous mathematical analysis and empirical validation. The model offers a powerful tool for advancing our understanding and treatment of retinal diseases.

Abstract: Mathematical modelling of the microcirculatory hemodynamics in the retina is an essential tool for understanding various diseases of the retina, yet remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of the retinal vasculature and its coupling to surrounding tissue. To address this, we develop a multiscale model that couples retinal vasculature across scales with interstitial tissue. Our model combines the one-dimensional (1D) model for arteries and veins with the coupled Darcy equations for capillaries and tissue. The model uses an analytic solution for capillary-tissue coupled system that provides a simple interpretation of the results along with much faster computation. The analytic solution implies a dynamic coupling condition that links the capillary bed with upstream arterial and downstream venous flows. The model is mathematically robust, demonstrated through analysis of the solution's truncation error and convergence. Its predictive accuracy is verified against experimental data and other models, making it useful in interpreting experimental results. Finally, the role of various parameters in controlling retinal hemodynamics is explored.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for predictability in virus behavior, driving the development of V-Dynamics as a tool to anticipate and mitigate future threats.

Method: V-Dynamics models host-virus interactions as a synchronized dual chaotic system governed by reactivity (ρ) and modulation by generation time (σ). It incorporates measurable constants like viral replication and immune evasion cross sections, rooted in quantum mechanics, to predict pandemic trajectories.

Result: The framework successfully predicted trends in SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron variants, enabling proactive measures to reduce transmission and socioeconomic impacts.

Conclusion: V-Dynamics offers a comprehensive approach to pandemic preparedness, integrating chaos theory and quantum mechanics to provide a roadmap for future pandemic prevention.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a key vulnerability: our failure to anticipate novel viral threats. Moving beyond descriptive virology, we introduce V-Reactor Dynamics (V-Dynamics), a physics-based framework modeling host-virus interaction as a synchronized dual chaotic system. This paradigm predicts viral evolution, immune response, transmission, and virulence through equations governed by the parameter reactivity ($ρ$). It quantifies infection phases, peak ($ρ>0$), plateau ($ρ\approx0$), clearance ($ρ<0$), transmission, and modality via $ρ/\ell$ (Reactivity/Generation time). Retrospectively, it correctly predicted SARS-CoV-2's higher transmissibility versus SARS-CoV's lethality and forecasted Omicron waves, exposing the lockdown-socioeconomic cost trade-off. We introduce measurable constants, viral replication, immune evasion, and drug absorption cross sections, derived from in vitro virion interactions. These quantum mechanical analogues relate to $ρ$ and $\ell$, enabling pre-outbreak predictive surveillance.V-Dynamics reveals a duality: microscopic chaos in viral production and macroscopic chaos in population transmission, linked by a scaling law. The sign of $ρ$, tied to the Lyapunov Exponent, dictates pandemic trajectory ($ρ>0$ for outbreak, $ρ<0$ for termination), offering a control mechanism. By unifying kinetics, cross-scale dynamics, and chaos theory, this framework provides a quantitative roadmap to preempt future pandemics.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: lattice strain is a method proposed to detect fractionalized fermionic excitation in quantum spin liquids.thermodynamic mechanical spectroscopy (TMS) and local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (LRUS) show promise in detecting the proposed signatures in candidate materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: strongly correlated systems pose a challenge for identifying exotic quantum phases. Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host fractionalized fermionic excitations, but no clear experimental signatures are known that do not rely on conventional electromagnetic probes. this paper addresses this challenge by proposing lattice strain as a potential method for detection.

Method: lattice strain is used as a mechanical deformation method applied on the honeycomb lattice. the Kitaev model is employed to demonstrate how different QSL phases respond to strain by inducing pseudo-Landau levels. the response includes pronounced Landau quantization, diamagnetic-like, and paramagnetic-like responses in distinct QSL phases. thermodynamic mechanical spectroscopy and local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy are discussed as practical tools for detecting these responses.

Result: the Kitaev spin liquid and chiral spin liquid exhibit distinct responses to strain, showing pronounced Landau quantization and other characteristics. the Majorana metal phase shows paramagnetic-like responses without forming Landau levels. this indicates that lattice strain can be used to distinguish between different QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. the proposed methods (TMS and LRUS) show promise for practical experiments in identifying such phases in candidate materials.

Conclusion: lattice strain provides a new avenue for detecting and differentiating QSL phases hosting fractionalized fermionic excitations. this approach, combined with spectroscopic techniques like TMS and LRUS, offers a practical pathway for experimentalists to identify these exotic quantum phases in candidate materials.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host emergent, fractionalized fermionic excitations that are charge-neutral. Identifying clear experimental signatures of these excitations remains a central challenge in the field of strongly correlated systems, as they do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes. Here, we propose lattice strain as a powerful and tunable probe: Mechanical deformation of the lattice generates large pseudomagnetic fields, inducing pseudo-Landau levels that serve as distinctive spectroscopic signatures of these excitations. Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials.

Abstract: Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $α$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $α$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $α$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $α$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.

Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.
  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.
  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.

A new type of inelastic scattering center for the charge and heat carriers has been detected and ascribed to the small-to-large Fermi-surface fluctuations. These are operating in the vicinity of and at the Kondo-destroying quantum critical point as fermionic quantum critical fluctuations and are considered the primary driver of the strange-metal behavior and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.

Abstract: Quantum simulations are a powerful tool for exploring strongly correlated many-body phenomena. Yet, their reach is limited by the fermion sign problem, which causes configuration weights to become negative, compromising statistical sampling. In auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the doped Hubbard model, neglecting the sign ${\cal S}$ of the weight leads to qualitatively wrong results -- most notably, an apparent suppression rather than enhancement of $d$-wave pairing at low temperature. Here we approach the problem from a different perspective: instead of identifying negative-weight paths, we examine the statistics of measured observables in a sign-resolved manner. By analyzing histograms of key quantities (kinetic energy, antiferromagnetic structure factor, and pair susceptibilities) for configurations with ${\cal S}=\pm1$, we derive an exact relation linking the bias from ignoring the sign to the difference between sign-resolved means, $Δμ$, and the average sign, $\langle {\cal S}\rangle$. Our framework provides a precise diagnostic of the origin of measurement bias in Quantum Monte Carlo and clarifies why observables such as the $d$-wave susceptibility are especially sensitive to the sign problem.

Abstract: We consider Rayleigh particles in a periodically modulated optical trap formed by two counter-propagating Gaussian beams.

The escape flights are terminated at the distance of hundreds wavelengths from the trap centrum and the particles return to the trap under the action of the Stokes force. The particle escape is shown to be a threshold effect that can be potentially employed for particle sorting.

Abstract: Exoskeletons play a crucial role in assisting patients with varying mobility levels during rehabilitation. However, existing control strategies face challenges such as imprecise trajectory tracking, interaction torque oscillations, and limited adaptability to diverse patient conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control algorithm that integrates a human-robot coupling dynamics model, a human torque-momentum observer (HTMO), and an adaptive parameter controller (APC). The algorithm first employs inverse dynamics to compute the joint torques required for the rehabilitation trajectory. The HTMO then estimates the torque exerted by the patient's joints and determines the torque error, which the exoskeleton compensates for via a spring-damper system, ultimately generating the target trajectory. Finally, the APC ensures adaptive assistive control. The proposed method is validated for its effectiveness in MATLAB/Simulink.

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the optical feedback dynamics of terahertz (THz) frequency combs generated from quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) using the effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations (ESMBEs). Starting from a free-running comb state at low bias (1.3Ith), we identify clear bifurcation routes as the external feedback is increased. In the weak feedback regime (C<1), the frequency comb operation remains stable; as feedback increases to the moderate feedback regime (1<C<2.4), the system transitions through frequency splitting into period-one (P1) oscillations around each comb, followed by higher-order bifurcations (P2, P4, P8). Within the range 2.4<C<13.86, only combs with P1 states are observed, with the split frequency increasing continuously with feedback strength. In the strong feedback regime (C>13.86), complex feedback dynamics re-emerged but with significantly reduced complexity compared with the weak feedback regime. More interestingly, we show that optical feedback can induce chaotic THz emission at higher bias current conditions (>1.6Ith), when the free-running laser output (C=0) is originally a stable frequency comb. The resulting chaotic dynamics, characterized by broadband spectra and large positive Lyapunov exponents, are shown to depend strongly on the linewidth enhancement factor. Although THz QCLs widely considered as ultrastable under external perturbations, this work provides the first detailed report of chaotic dynamics and routes to chaos in THz QCLs under optical feedback. These findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in THz QCLs but also open new possibilities for exploiting applications of chaotic light in THz sensing, imaging and secure communications.

We present the design, integration, and validation of a fully automated closed-loop DHM system engineered for high-throughput mechanical characterization of biological cells. The system integrates automated serpentine scanning, real-time YOLO-based object detection, and a high-performance, multi-threaded software architecture using pinned memory and SPSC queues. This design enables the GPU-accelerated reconstruction pipeline to run fully in parallel with the 50 fps data acquisition, adding no sequential overhead. A key contribution is the validation of a robust, multi-stage holographic autofocus strategy; we demonstrate that a selected metric (based on a low-pass filter and standard deviation) provides reliable focusing for noisy holograms where conventional methods (e.g., Tenengrad, Laplacian) fail entirely. Performance analysis of the complete system identifies the 2.23-second autofocus operation-not reconstruction-as the primary throughput bottleneck, resulting in a 9.62-second analysis time per object. This work delivers a complete functional platform for autonomous DHM screening and provides a clear, data-driven path for future optimization, proposing a hybrid brightfield imaging modality to address current bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We report the existence of multi-peaked vector soliton families in normally dispersive passive Kerr resonators. Through cross-phase modulation between two orthogonal polarization components, each peak becomes tightly interlocked, enabling robust localization of the entire wave packet in defocusing cavities. Analysis using snakes-and-ladder diagrams demonstrates the diversity of these vector soliton families, which include dark-bright multi-peak solitons, flat-topped solitons, and modulation instability patterns, among others. Furthermore, stability analysis based on the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations reveals that specific combinations of parameters can sustain stable vector cavity solitons, whose peak numbers can be continuously tuned by adding appropriate perturbations. These findings significantly expand the scope of soliton dynamics and optical frequency comb generation in pumped-dissipative systems, independent of dispersion conditions.

*Roame A. Hildebrand,Wance Wang,Connor Goham,Alessandro Restelli,Joseph W. Britton*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The study highlights that misaligned Fabry-Perot cavities can cause a shift in the lock point during PDH offset-locking, leading to significant frequency deviations. This effect can be minimized significantly by using a spectrally-pure frequency offset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise frequency control is vital in various fields such as optical spectroscopy and quantum information science. The PDH technique is commonly used, but small errors can lead to significant deviations. This study aims to identify and reduce such errors.

Method: The researchers used an experiment involving a sinusoidally driven EOM to observe the frequency shift caused by misaligned Fabry-Perot cavities. They then developed a model to explain the observed deviations and tested it experimentally.

Result: The experiment confirmed the presence of frequency deviations up to 50% of the cavity linewidth. The model provided a good match with experimental data. By implementing a spectrally-pure frequency offset, they achieved a tenfold reduction in deviations.

Conclusion: This research underscores the need to consider residual optical sidebands and higher-order spatial modes in PDH systems. The proposed solution enhances the precision of optical clocks and spectroscopic measurements, contributing to advancements in quantum information science.

Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique is widely used to stabilize the frequency of lasers. Here we report on a routinely underestimated source of error in PDH offset-locking: a shift in the lock point due to the unintended interaction between residual optical sidebands and higher-order spatial modes in misaligned Fabry-Perot cavities. Significant frequency deviations-up to 50% of the cavity linewidth-can arise when the optical offset is obtained from a sinusoidally driven EOM. We measure this deviation experimentally, find agreement with a simple model, and show how a spectrally-pure frequency offset can reduce the deviation by an order of magnitude. Our findings draw attention to a systematic effect of importance to precision optical spectroscopy, optical clocks, and quantum information science.

Abstract: Accessing the electric field of light with petahertz bandwidths in ambient air is a rapidly advancing frontier, essential for probing ultrafast dynamics driven by classical or quantum ultrashort pulses. Near-petahertz fieldoscopy has recently demonstrated sub-cycle access to light-matter interactions, enabling label-free spectro-microscopy of liquids and solids with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, detection sensitivity, and dynamic range. However, current implementations still rely on temporal scanning and averaging over many laser pulses. Here, we introduce photonic time-stretch fieldoscopy, enabling single-shot electric-field detection at near-petahertz frequencies. Numerical results demonstrate that integrating fieldoscopy with a nonlinear time lens enables the real-time acquisition of ultrashort optical waveforms with a detection bandwidth approaching petahertz. The resulting large temporal aperture and attosecond resolution allow direct single-shot detection of transient electric fields generated in solid or liquid samples. This concept opens new avenues for petahertz electronics, ultrafast spectro-microscopy, and the study of dynamic, non-repetitive optical phenomena

Result: STUDIES SHOWED THAT ULTRATHIN FILMS NEAR THE PERCOLATION THRESHOLD HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPTICAL PERMITTIVITY ( ε₁ ) AND LOSS ( ε₂ ). DISCONNUOUS FILMS NEAR PERCOLATION enabled DESIGNED OPTICAL Cavities WITH IMPROVED COLOR GENERATION AND REDUCED THICKNESSES COMPARED TO CONTINUOUS FILMS.

Conclusion: THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT TUNABLE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF ULTRATHIN FILMS NEAR THE PERCOLATION THRESHOLD CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF PHOTONICS DEVICES THROUGH DESIGNED OPTICAL Cavities AND THIN FILM STRUCTURES.

Abstract: Ultrathin bismuth films (<10 nm) are emerging candidates for advanced applications in photonics. It has been shown that Bi-based subwavelength optical cavities show outstanding features, including broad tuneable resonances for structural color generation and broadband perfect absorption for light harvesting. While current devices are based on continuous Bi films, integrating ultrathin films around the percolation threshold with a tailored morphology promises to enable more compact devices with a wider tunability range and/or enhanced optical response. In this context, we report the tailoring of the morphology and UV-Vis-NIR effective optical dielectric function ( $\varepsilon$= $\varepsilon_1$+i$\varepsilon_2$) of ultrathin Bi films around the percolation threshold. Just below percolation, the films effective optical permittivity $\varepsilon_1$ differs markedly from that of a continuous film, as it turns from negative to positive while its effective optical loss $\varepsilon_2$ is reduced. We showcase the relevance of such dielectric tunability for the design of enhanced subwavelength optical cavities operating in the NIR and visible regions. In particular, we show that discontinuous near-percolation films enable designing optimized cavities for efficient colour generation with a thickness almost 3 times smaller than what was previously achieved for continuous films.

TL;DR: A compact photonic integrated circuit is presented for precision polarization measurement, with a robust calibration procedure to handle manufacturing imperfections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polarization is a critical property of light with wide-ranging applications, but direct measurement is challenging. This work addresses the need for cost-effective, compact polarizationmeasurement solutions.

Method: The circuit utilizes a silicon nitride on-chip polarization-splitting grating coupler and passive interferometers to encode polarization into intensity signals.

Result: The design demonstrates high-speed, small-footprint, and robust performance despite manufacturing variations.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable, efficient alternative to conventional bulk optics for polarization sensing.

Abstract: Polarization is a fundamental property of light that carries distinct and valuable information. Consequently, its precise measurement is crucial for numerous applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Since polarization cannot be measured directly, it is typically inferred by converting it into intensity signals using dedicated optical elements. Conventional approaches, however, predominantly rely on bulky optical components, leading to considerably high fabrication costs and limited integration density. Here, we introduce a passive photonic integrated circuit capable of precisely determining the polarization state of visible free-space light. An silicon nitride on-chip architecture employing a compact polarization-splitting grating coupler and a set of passive interferometers encodes the polarization information into intensity signals, allowing conventional detectors to accurately reconstruct the polarization state. With increasing compactness of photonic components, however, susceptibility to fabrication tolerances as well as intrinsic design constraints increases, potentially leading to non\-/ideal behaviour. To address this, we introduce a robust calibration procedure that enables precise measurements even in the presence of imperfections. The chip design, combined with the calibration procedure, offers a robust, small-footprint, and high-speed approach to polarimetry, enabling a wide range of applications.

Abstract: An interdigitated photoconductive antenna (i-PCA) for terahertz (THz) emission with a novel metal-insulator-semiconductor interface is designed with the aim of developing compact and scalable THz devices. The photoconductive material is an amorphous germanium (Ge) film deposited using DC magnetron sputtering. The antenna electrodes are composed of gold-germanium (AuGe). With the integration of a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer that acts as an electrical mask on alternate active areas, we present a simple approach to fabricate a large-area i-PCA. Along with a simplified fabrication compared to other existing designs, our approach increases the electrical robustness of the emitter and reduces the inactive gap area on the device. The i-PCA is capable of THz emission up to 2.5 THz and 36 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is promising for applications in CMOS technologies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explore the effects of incorporating negative index materials into the physics of time-varying media and find that changing the refractive index from positive to negative creates a perfect time-reversed wave: a perfect time-domain lens. Unlike other mechanisms of phase conjugation, the perfect time-domain lens time-reverses both the propagating waves and the evanescent part of the spectrum. Moreover, we find that the time-reversed wave can be slowed down or accelerated, depending on the refractive index ratio. We show that this effect remains strong even when the refractive index varies arbitrarily slow, in sharp contradistinction to time-reflection which necessitates large index changes at sub-cycle rates. This is the first avenue found to yield significant negative-frequency waves using a temporal interface without the need for sub-cycle modulation or impedance matching. The effect can be used to record extreme ultrafast information and subsequently play it backwards at a slow rate, and vice-versa.

Abstract: Recent research on needle beams and space-time wavepackets (STWPs) is presented. Quasi-nondiffracting STWPs propagate at stable spatial and temporal localization over extended distances. In a simple model, STWPs are interpreted as being composed of differential needle beams. Simulations indicate that pulsed Bessel-like needle beams can reach higher spectral and temporal homogeneity compared to spatio-spectrally shaped focused Gaussian beams. The interference of femtosecond needle beam arrays leads to nondiffracting self-imaging in space and time. High-speed switching of STWPs with combined optical systems, orbital angular momentum generation with self-torque and other emerging fields of research are addressed

Abstract: Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital sign with significant diagnostic value. Existing RR monitors often suffer from baseline drift over time, breaths can be occluded by limb or body movements, and many systems struggle to resolve shallow or extreme thoracic motion. Here, we propose a novel RR-monitoring sensor based on fiber-cavity attenuated phase-shift spectroscopy~(CAPS). The sensor comprises a fiber cavity whose portion is embedded into a flexible chest binder in a sinusoidal-like pattern, which the patient wears. Thoracic expansion and contraction during breathing modulate the cavity, and RR is extracted through CAPS measurements. Our sensor exhibits high reproducibility, strong sensitivity to strain and pressure induced by chest movements, inherent resistance to baseline drift, and the ability to detect body movements. The system achieves a root-mean-square error of 0.91 breaths per minute relative to the ground truth, across RR values ranging from 8 to 44 breaths per minute, when tested on multiple subjects in various postures, including sitting, supine, prone, and lateral positions. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of comprehensive optical fiber-based sleep monitoring systems.

Abstract: Self-organized three-dimensional (3D) ion Coulomb crystals in linear Paul traps naturally form concentric shells that provide a curved, atomically resolved interface for studying two-dimensional (2D) nanofriction. Building on prior work that used 2D ion crystals to investigate one-dimensional (1D) nanofriction and orientational melting, we leverage this foundation to extend friction studies from linear ion chains and planar rings to 3D shell structures. Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we first map shell formation as a function of ion number $N$ and the trapping aspect ratio, yielding a simple relation that can aid ion-number estimation in experiments. We compute a Peierls--Nabarro-type energy landscape for the rotation of the outer shell against the inner core, showing drastic changes in the effective energy barrier up to a factor of about 60 with only small changes in $N$. Using dynamical simulations, we apply rotational torques to the outer shell of selected systems and show that small changes in $N$ impact the commensurability between shells and can, in some cases, induce a hysteretic response due to torque-induced metastable states. We find that spatially varying coupling to the inner-core corrugation can create coexisting fast and slow moving domains within the rotating outer shell, realizing multidimensional friction where intra-shell shear and inter-shell nanofriction act simultaneously. Our results have implications for stabilizing many-body systems and for the development of ultra-low-friction nanomechanical devices such as ion-based nanorotors and torque sensors.

Abstract: Raman transitions have a wide range of applications in atomic physics and have recently been proposed as a means for improving high-precision high-voltage measurements. Here, we present a theoretical analysis and a first experimental demonstration of $5s\,^2\mathrm{S}_{1/2} \rightarrow 4d\,^2\mathrm{D}_{3/2,5/2}$ Raman transitions in $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions in collinear laser spectroscopy. For the theoretical description the three-level system is reduced to an effective two-level system, in order to estimate the experimental parameters, while the role of the spatial laser intensity distribution in combination with the radial extension of the ion beam are elucidated by performing simulations of the full four-level system. Experimentally, we realized the first velocity-selective Raman transition in collinear laser spectroscopy. Using a $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion beam, we demonstrate a reduction in the energy width to less than $200\,$meV, which is about an order of magnitude reduction compared to the usage of an optical dipole transition as in previous works. We also investigate two-photon Rabi oscillations and show that their observed collapse is consistent with the simulations.

Abstract: Scintillators are transparent materials that interact with high-energy particles and emit visible light as a result. They are used in state of the art methods of measuring high-energy particles and radiation sources. Most existing methods use fast single-pixel detectors to detect and time scintillation events. Cameras provide spatial resolution but can only capture an average over many events, making it difficult to image the events associated with an individual particle. Emerging single-photon avalanche diode cameras combine speed and spatial resolution to enable capturing images of individual events. This allows us to use machine vision techniques to analyze events, enabling new types of detectors. The main challenge is the very low brightness of the events. Techniques have to work with a very limited number of photons.
  We propose a kaleidoscopic scintillator to increase light collection in a single-photon camera while preserving the event's spatial information. The kaleidoscopic geometry creates mirror reflections of the event in known locations for a given event location that are captured by the camera. We introduce theory for imaging an event in a kaleidoscopic scintillator and an algorithm to estimate the event's 3D position. We find that the kaleidoscopic scintillator design provides sufficient light collection to perform high-resolution event measurements for advanced radiation imaging techniques using a commercial CMOS single-photon camera.

### [110] [AtomDisc: An Atom-level Tokenizer that Boosts Molecular LLMs and Reveals Structure--Property Associations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03080)
*Mingxu Zhang,Dazhong Shen,Ying Sun*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: LLMs are being used to advance molecular science, but converting molecular information into token-based processing remains a challenge. We address this by introducing AtomDisc, a framework that embeds atom-level local environments as structure-aware tokens. Our experiments show that AtomDisc improves property prediction and molecular generation. The success of AtomDisc suggests it could help build more powerful molecular LLMs for mechanistic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing interest in applying machine learning, particularly LLMs, to molecular science. However, the limitation of token-based processing for molecular information remains a significant obstacle. Recent work has focused on tokenizing molecular topology, but there is a need for more effective fine-grained tokenization of local atomic environments, as these play a crucial role in chemical reactions and properties.

Method: We developed AtomDisc, a structure-aware tokenization framework. We designed the tokens to capture detailed information about the local environments of atoms. By embedding these tokens directly into LLMs, we created a system that could analyze and generate molecules more effectively. Through careful experimentation and analysis of the results, we validated the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: Our experiments demonstrated that AtomDisc significantly improves the ability of LLMs to predict molecular properties and generate new molecules. The framework showed state-of-the-art performance, indicating that the way in which we tokenize local atomic environments is effective.

Conclusion: AtomDisc represents a promising solution to the challenge of tokenizing local molecular information. By providing a way to embed detailed structural features into LLM processing, it opens new possibilities for using LLMs in molecular science. The success of AtomDisc suggests it could be a valuable tool for constructing more powerful molecular LLMs that can provide mechanistic insights and advance chemical reasoning.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are accelerating discovery in molecular science. However, adapting molecular information to the serialized, token-based processing of LLMs remains a key challenge. Compared to other representations, molecular graphs explicitly encode atomic connectivity and local topological environments, which are key determinants of atomic behavior and molecular properties. Despite recent efforts to tokenize overall molecular topology, there still lacks effective fine-grained tokenization of local atomic environments, which are critical for determining sophisticated chemical properties and reactivity. To address these issues, we introduce AtomDisc, a novel framework that quantizes atom-level local environments into structure-aware tokens embedded directly in LLM's token space. Our experiments show that AtomDisc, in a data-driven way, can distinguish chemically meaningful structural features that reveal structure-property associations. Equipping LLMs with AtomDisc tokens injects an interpretable inductive bias that delivers state-of-the-art performance on property prediction and molecular generation. Our methodology and findings can pave the way for constructing more powerful molecular LLMs aimed at mechanistic insight and complex chemical reasoning.

Abstract: Surfactants play an important role in determining the cleaning performance and stability of detergents. However, the design of new surfactants using traditional methods is often time-consuming, complex, and largely based on trial and error. Recent studies have incorporated data-driven and computational approaches to generate new surfactants and predict properties of surfactants, but most of these approaches either optimize on a single property or train on a small number of surfactants. In this work, we investigate the generative capabilities of an existing graph diffusion based inverse design model and a transformer based molecule optimization model, for non-ionic surfactants. We train both models to generate non-ionic surfactants based on single- and multi-property values, predict the same properties o using trained property predictor models for generated molecules, and validate a few them using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the inverse design model is better at generating a diverse set of molecules, while the transformer is better at generating molecules which satisfy input property constraints better. We also observe that molecules generated using single property condition, on average, satisfy the input property condition better when compared to molecules generated using multiple property conditions. From molecular dynamics simulations, we observe that the predicted properties of the selected molecules are close to the simulated results concluding that both methods are capable of generating surfactants that actually satisfy input property condtions.

### [112] [On-the-Fly Cavity-Molecular Dynamics of Vibrational Polaritons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03277)

TL;DR: The research introduces a new method combining DFTB and a light-matter Hamiltonian to study vibrational polaritons in Fabry-Pérot cavities, using Mulliken charges to reduce computational cost while analyzing their linear spectra. An open-source package is provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding light-matter interactions in confined systems, such as optical cavities, is crucial for advancing quantum optics and cavity quantum electrodynamics. This work aims to develop efficient computational methods to study such systems.

Method: The method involves using the DFTB approach, a density functional theory-based tight-binding method, coupled with a light-matter Hamiltonian that goes beyond the long-wavelength approximation. The researchers exploit the sparse nature of light-matter interactions for efficient computation and develop a parallelized propagation scheme with minimal inter-CPU communication.

Result: The study demonstrates that replacing computationally expensive Born charges with Mulliken charges can effectively obtain qualitatively accurate linear spectra, especially when the interaction's nonlinearity is not significant. However, this simplification may lead to inaccuracies when studying cavity effects on energy transport or chemical dynamics.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable tool for efficiently analyzing vibrational polaritons in optical cavities but notes its limitations when applied to more complex phenomena involving cavity modifications of energy transport or chemical dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we combine the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) approach with a light-matter Hamiltonian beyond the long-wavelength approximation to propagate the dynamics of vibrational polaritons formed by coupling molecular vibrations to confined radiation inside a Fabry-Pérot optical cavity. Here, we develop a parallelized propagation scheme with lightweight inter-CPU communication by exploiting the sparse nature of the light-matter interactions in the real space representation. We find that the computationally expensive Born charges required for our propagation can be replaced with the computationally inexpensive Mulliken charges to obtain qualitatively accurate linear spectra especially when the nonlinearity (arising from molecular vibrations) of the light-matter interaction term is not substantial. However, the same approach may not be suitable to be used for studying cavity modification of energy transport or chemical dynamics as this approximation leads to spurious heating of the light-matter hybrid system. We demonstrate the utility of this on-the-fly approach to compute angle resolved polaritonic spectra of water. We implement our approach as an open-source computational package, CavOTF, which is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Electrostatic interactions fundamentally govern the structure and transport of electrolytes. In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures. Despite the pronounced growth of ionic clusters, their percolation transition does not appear to be directly coupled to the onset of these crossovers. Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the diffusion-corrected ion-pair lifetime provides a consistent descriptor linking ionic structure and dynamics across electrolyte systems.

Abstract: This study presents a closed-loop biorefinery strategy that thermochemically upcycles fermentation residues (FRs) from photo-fermentative biohydrogen production (PFHP) into functional biochar catalysts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the initial PFHP process. Four FRs derived from hydrothermal and ethylene glycol-pretreated corn stover were pyrolyzed at 700°C. Multi-model kinetic analyses revealed diffusion-controlled mechanisms with activation energies ranging from 157 to 278 kJ/mol, while thermodynamic profiling highlighted the influence of feedstock composition on reaction spontaneity and entropy. Pyrolysis effectively restored porosity compromised during fermentation, yielding biochar with tailored properties: microporous BC3 (185 m2/g) from oxygen-rich precursors and mesoporous BC4 (76.58 m2/g) from graphitized residues. When reintroduced into PFHP, BC3 maximized cumulative hydrogen yield (570 mL) via pH buffering, and BC4 achieved the highest production rate (14.91 mL/h) through electron shuttle mechanisms. The integrated process concurrently generated syngas, bio-oil, and catalytic biochar, enabling waste valorization, renewable energy output, and process enhancement within a circular bioeconomy framework.

Result: simulations accurately reproduce experimental observations of bimodal energy loss and angular distributions, and reveal a mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer through transient Ge-H bond formation and subsequent inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate.

Conclusion: this work provides insights into the site-specific and dynamic nature of electron transfer at semiconductor surfaces, highlighting the importance of considering electronic and nuclear dynamics in surface science.

Abstract: A first-principles coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation based on real-time, time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics quantitatively repro-duces bimodal translational energy loss and angular distributions observed in experiment for hydrogen atom scattering from Ge(111)-c(2*8). The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions.

Abstract: Ultracold neutral atoms in optical lattices are a promising platform for simulating the behavior of complex materials and implementing quantum gates. We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant. We obtain high-fidelity gates based on a one-dimensional confinement simulation. Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately.

Abstract: An excitonic approach to the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at elevated densities below the Mott transition is presented. The theory is valid from the coherent regime, where coherent excitonic transitions and biexcitons dominate, to the incoherent regime, where excitonic occupations dominate. Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed.

Abstract: The fluorescence of triplet excitons and color-centers is strongly dependent on magnetic field that mixes the zero field spin eigenstates that determine the radiative recombination rates back into the singlet ground state through spin-orbit coupling. For films of molecules, and polycristaline color-centers samples an average over molecular orientations has to be performed to model the magneto-fluorescence lineshapes. This limits our analytical understanding of the lineshapes and complicates the analysis of the fluorescence dependence on magnetic field. Here, we present a framework that allows to average over triplet molecular orientations analytically. Our approach achieves provides very accurate numerical routines computing precisely the averages matrix elements that appear in magneto-fluorescence and semi-analytical approximations that can be used to model experimental traces.

Abstract: Integrating semiconducting and magnetic materials could combine transistor-like operation with nonvolatility and enable architectures such as logic-in-memory. Here, we employ correlated electrical transport and scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to elucidate a spin transistor concept that amalgamates both vertical and lateral transport in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor, distinct from purely vertical tunneling devices. Our device, based on a monolayer-bilayer junction in CrSBr, displays giant, gate-tunable magnetoresistance driven by the dual action of electrostatic doping on space-charge-limited lateral conduction and interlayer exchange coupling. Moreover, we visualize a field-trainable, layer-sharing effect that selects between coherent or domain-wall reversal at the spin-flip transition, enabling multilevel, memristive conductance states. These findings open opportunities for 2D magnetic semiconductors to address limitations in contemporary computing.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework to engineer hybrid-order and higher-order topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulators by coupling to $d$-wave altermagnets (AMs). Presence of only $d_{x^2-y^2}$-type AM drives the system into a hybrid-order topological phase where both first-order and second-order topological phases coexist. This phase is characterized by spectral analysis, low-energy surface theory, dipolar and quadrupolar winding numbers, and it's signature is further confirmed by two-terminal differential conductance calculations. Incorporation of the $d_{x^2-z^2}$-type AM drives the system into two second-order topological insulator phases hosting distinct type of hinge modes. They are also topologically characterized by spectral analysis, topological invariants, low-energy surface thoery, and transport calculations. Importantly, the localization and direction of propagation of these one-dimensional hinge modes are controllable by tuning the relative strengths of the alermagnetic exchange orders. We utilize this feature to propose a tunable current-switching behaviour mediated via the hinge modes. Our results establish AMs based hybrid structure as a versatile platform for controllable higher-order topology and hinge-mediated device applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of two-dimensional materials and their applications in spintronic devices is a rapidly growing field, and this paper contributes to our understanding of how antiferromagnetic materials can be utilized in magnetic tunnel junctions.

Method: The authors experimentally investigated the use of the A-type antiferromagnetic material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 as an electrode in van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. They employed bias measurements and temperature-dependent studies to analyze the magnetic and electrical properties.

Result: The study reveals that the material exhibits superior switching performance, with a high tunneling magnetoresistance of ~25% at low currents (1nA) and room temperature. The material's spin-flop effect allows for programmable memory behavior, and the interfacial TMR can be tuned effectively under varying conditions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of two-dimensional antiferromagnets in advancing spintronic devices by providing flexible and high-performance magnetic tunnel junctions.

Abstract: The utilization of two-dimensional (2D) materials in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has shown excellent performance and rich physics. As for 2D antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments in different layers respond asynchronously and can be configured at various states under different magnetic fields, showing the possibility of efficient magnetic and electrical tunability. In this report, A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT) works as electrodes to realize full van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. Owing to the interfacial effect, the even-layer FCGT, although with zero net magnetization, exhibits spin selectivity in MTJ architecture contributing to a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) reaching about 25% at a low operating current 1 nA at 100 K and persists near room temperature. Due to the surface spin-flop (SSF) effect in antiferromagnetic FCGT, the alternation flexibility between the volatile and nonvolatile memory behavior is achieved. The interfacial TMR can be tuned efficiently in amplitude and even sign under different bias currents and temperatures. These findings show precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs based on 2D antiferromagnets and highlight the promise of 2D antiferromagnets for spintronic devices.

Abstract: Recent advances in coherent conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttling are paving the way for large-scale quantum computing platforms with qubit connectivity achieved by spin qubit shuttles. We developed a simulation tool to investigate numerically the impact of device imperfections on the spin-coherence of conveyor-mode shuttling in Si/SiGe. We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane. We consider different locations of a single charge defect with respect to the center of the shuttle lane, multiple orbital states of the electron in the shuttle with $g$-factor differences between the orbital levels, and orbital relaxation induced by electron-phonon interaction. With this simulation framework, we identify the critical defect density of charged point defects in the heterostructure for conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttle devices and quantify the impact of a single defect on the coherence of a qubit.

TL;DR: The paper experiments on a high quality twisted MoTe2 device, demonstrating quantum geometry-driven competition between FQAH/CFL and TEC phases in a moiré Chern band.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of quantum geometry in stabilizing the FQAH effect is crucial in the field of condensed matter physics, particularly in the study of correlated topological phases.

Method: The research involves fabricating a twisted MoTe2 device with both A-A and A-AB bilayer regions. Transport and optical measurements are performed, alongside exact diagonalization calculations that incorporate the effects of a remote layer.

Result: The experiments reveal that when the device is in the A-A region, composite Fermi liquid CFL/FQAH phases are observed. Switching to the A-AB region induces topological electronic crystals (TEC) with quantized Hall conductance at v=1/2, 2/3, and an incommensurate v=0.53. The transition from a CFL-like state to a Chern number C=1 TEC state is observed with changes in band geometry.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence of how quantum geometry influences the competition between different topological phases, advancing our understanding of correlated quantum phenomena and guiding future experiments in this complex field.

Abstract: The quantum geometry of Bloch wavefunctions,encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, is believed to be a decisive ingredient in stabilizing fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect(i.e., fractional Chern insulator, FCI, at zero magnetic field), against competing symmetry-breaking phases.A direct experimental demonstration of quantum geometry-driven switching between distinct correlated topological phases, however, has been lacking. Here, we report experimental evidence of such a switch in a high-quality 3.7 twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) device consisting of both A-A bilayer and A-AB trilayer regions. While composite Fermi liquid CFL/FQAH phases are established in A-A tMoTe2,the A-AB region-effectively an A-A moire bilayer proximitized by a remote B layer-develops a series of topological electronic crystal (TEC, also referred to as generalized QAH crystal, QAHC) states with integer quantized Hall conductance at commensurate fractional fillings v=1/2, 2/3, and an incommensurate filling factor v=0.53.The electrostatic phase diagram is mapped out by combined transport and optical measurements, showing that these TEC states emerge within the first moir'e valence band prior to any charge transfer to the B layer. Exact diagonalization (ED) incorporating the remote-layer-induced intralayer potential demonstrates a transition from a CFL-like manifold in the A-A limit to a Chern number C=1 ground-state consistent with a TEC at v=1/2 , accompanied by the further breakdown of ideal band geometry. Our results provide experimental evidence of quantum geometry-tuned competition between FQAH/CFL and TEC phases in a moiré Chern band and pave the way for further exploring correlation-driven topological phenomena by tuning quantum geometry.

Motivation: To understand and predict nonrelativistic magnetic responses and their symmetries in materials where spin-orbit coupling is negligible.

Result:  spin-current generation independent of spin-orbit coupling in collinear antiferromagnet.

Conclusion: Framework enables systematic analysis of nonrelativistic spin phenomena without spin-orbit coupling. This work paves the way for understanding and predicting topological multipoles and spin response.

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of multipoles has been widely used to describe and classify various magnetic and electric responses in solids, providing a systematic way to identify symmetry-allowed or -forbidden physical responses. Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: Nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport phenomena provide a direct probe of band quantum geometry in noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials, such as the nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole. In altermagnets, a recently discovered class of even-parity collinear magnets with $C_n\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, conventional second-order responses are prohibited by an emergent $C_{2z}$ symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts this prohibition, inducing a planar magnetotransport that directly probes the intrinsic quantum geometry and the distinctive $C_n\mathcal{T}$ nature of altermagnetic orders. We show that the field-dependent quantum geometric susceptibility generates versatile planar magnetotransport, including the planar Hall effects and nonreciprocal responses. Our work establishes distinctive signatures of altermagnetism in linear and nonlinear magnetotransport, providing a general framework for measuring quantum geometric responses and probing altermagnetic order.

Abstract: We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.

TL;DR: This paper explores two-component fractional quantum Hall states and observes high-order states emerging below filling factor 1 when an in-plane magnetic field induces a monolayer-to-bilayer transition in ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum wells. These states appear symmetrically near ν=1, including robust unbalanced states. The work expands our understanding of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and the interplay between symmetry, topology, and interactions in fractional quantum Hall systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a key concept in condensed matter physics, and understanding the nature of two-component fractional quantum Hall (2C-FQH) states in electron bilayers is crucial for advancing knowledge in this field.

Method: The authors conducted a combination of theoretical and experimental work, simulating the electron system in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well under varying in-plane magnetic fields to identify and characterize the high-order 2C-FQH states that emerge near filling factor 1.

Result: The study reveals that when the in-plane magnetic field decreases, more high-order FQH states can be observed condensing near ν=1, including unbalanced states that follow a new pattern distinct from the typical hierarchy of filling fractions.

Conclusion: These discoveries enrich the theoretical landscape of FQHE and suggest new possibilities for observing and controlling these exotic states of matter experimentally. The work paves the way for further exploration of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and the interplay between symmetry and other factors in cold atom and condensed matter systems.

Abstract: Two-component fractional quantum Hall (2C-FQH) states in electron bilayers have been known for decades, yet their experimental realization remained limited to low-order fractions. Here we report on several families of high-order 2C-FQH states that emerge when an in-plane magnetic field drives a controlled monolayer-to-bilayer transition in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well. These families of states proliferate symmetrically toward the filling factor $ν= 1$, from both $ν= 2/3$ and $ν= 4/3$, thereby respecting particle-hole symmetry. Surprisingly, many unbalanced states (with unequal layer fillings) are more robust than their parent balanced states, defying the expected hierarchy of Jain sequences. Our findings substantially expand the known landscape of 2C-FQH states, highlighting the unexpected richness of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and opening new routes for probing the interplay of symmetry, topology, and interactions in quantum Hall systems.

Abstract: Interfacial exchange coupling between antiferromagnets (AFMs) and ferromagnets (FMs) crucially makes it possible to shift the FM hysteresis, known as exchange bias, and to switch AFM states. Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM-FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS$_4$, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM-FM technologies.

Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators can host chiral 1D edge channels at zero magnetic field, when a magnetic gap opens at the Dirac point in the band structure of 2D topological surface states, lead- ing to the quantum anomalous Hall effect in ultra-thin nanostructures. For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.
